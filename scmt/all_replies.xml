    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello MAFU,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thankyou for asking me these questions to analyse more better .&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Where exactly are you seeing the different values?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The different values are between the MB51 snapshot and the values in the accounts in ledger 2L.&lt;BR /&gt;Are you checking the inventory account, or another line item in the posting? Also, which process created these postings?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is how I check stock accounts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Is the difference appearing in one currency or in multiple currencies?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The differences appeared in PLN. Other currency is not important for now.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Are the materials involved using very small standard/moving average pri&lt;/STRONG&gt;ces that could cause rounding differences?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I saw also the difference in value on stock where the price units where the same&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Are the prices consistent across the different ledgers?&lt;/STRONG&gt;data are consistent in both ledgers apart from price unit which can influence some roundings.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Welcome to your one-stop shop to learn and share knowledge about SAP's ready-to-run public cloud ERP software solution.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud ERP is part of &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-suite.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; that brings AI, data, and applications together into a fully integrated system. This community is open for anyone in the Cloud ERP ecosystem–customers, partners, and SAP experts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In this blog post I’d like to outline the innovations for SAP Cloud ERP 2602 in the area of Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management. These are the topics that are covered:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced integration of project plan information with SAP Cloud ERP (6JN)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Project staffing view for resource managers (6JO)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Allowing contingent workers (cost center procured) to record time on enterprise projects (1NT, 1Q4)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatic removal of billing block for sales order billing plans (1NT)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule as project assistant (beta), planned to be available mid-March&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Further innovations &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Check out my video to get a glimpse of the new features:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F7LSNTjnAWIY%3Flist%3DPL3ZRUb1AKkpS8Yhb3mjbPvUjBiPpn1fjj&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7LSNTjnAWIY&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F7LSNTjnAWIY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="200" height="112" scrolling="no" title="Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management in SAP Cloud ERP 2602 | Release Highlights" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In today's fast-paced business environment, running projects efficiently, on time, and on budget is more critical than ever. This release is packed with features designed to bring more intelligence, automation, and transparency to your projects, ultimately driving significant business value. We’ve focused on streamlining processes, enhancing integration, and even giving you a glimpse into the future with AI-powered assistance.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Let's dive into the highlights that will help you unlock new levels of project success.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1787853886"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhancements in SAP Project and Resource Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1720423100"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced integration of project plan information with SAP Cloud ERP &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In complex projects spanning engineering, manufacturing, and services, a major challenge is keeping project execution plans in sync with core financial and logistical data. A delay in a design phase, for example, has a direct impact on procurement timelines and billing dates. If this information isn't shared instantly between the project planning tool and the core ERP, decisions are made based on outdated information. To solve this, our 2602 release supercharges the integration between SAP Project and Resource Management, our solution on the SAP Business Technology Platform, and SAP Cloud ERP. Now, when a project manager adjusts a project plan – such as extending a phase – the system automatically synchronizes these date changes with the core ERP in real time.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This direct synchronization ensures that your financial, commercial, and logistical data within SAP Cloud ERP always reflects the most current project reality, empowering you to make reliable decisions based on a single source of truth. By automating the update process, you eliminate the need for project teams to manually replicate date changes across systems, which significantly reduces administrative effort and minimizes the risk of human error. This tight integration also lays the groundwork for faster billing cycles, as milestone completions in the project plan can now directly trigger commercial processes in the core system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_1giafnid" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 1: &lt;EM&gt;Improved integration of project plan information between SAP Cloud ERP and SAP Project and Resource Management, enables better decision-making in projects through reliable, up-to-date project plan information.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523909595"&gt;Project staffing view for resource managers&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resource managers are constantly juggling demands from multiple projects, and gaining a clear, consolidated overview of the staffing situation for a specific project can be a fragmented and time-consuming process. To address this pain point, we are introducing a brand-new SAP Fiori app called “Manage Request Assignments”. This powerful application is designed specifically for resource managers, providing a single, project-centric view of all resource requests. It shows at a glance which roles have been fully staffed, which are partially staffed, and which are still open, eliminating the need to dig through multiple screens and reports.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This new application provides resource managers with unprecedented transparency into the staffing health of any project, allowing them to instantly identify bottlenecks and open demands without extensive research. Having all the necessary information in one place, with direct navigation to take action, streamlines the workflow and dramatically reduces the time it takes to staff open requests and get the right people on the right tasks. Ultimately, a clear, holistic overview empowers resource managers to more effectively optimize staffing within a single project or re-allocate experts across multiple projects, ensuring your most valuable resources are deployed with maximum impact.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_shjfwl4q" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 2: &lt;EM&gt;The “Manage Request Assignments” application allows users to efficiently view the resource request and assignment details at a project level.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1327396090"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Other Innovations&lt;/STRONG&gt; in SAP Project and Resource Management&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additional enhancements introduced in SAP Project and Resource Management. For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Technical user flow coverage (client credential flow) for some APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use of actual dates in scheduling&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Consideration of working and none working days in scheduling&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ability to block certain file types during file upload&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additional details for tasks and collaboration project&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For a complete list and more details please take a look into the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/whats-new/a39e803ae8974c4e942b05c27350e662?clear=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What's new document&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; for SAP Project and Resource Management&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1001799866"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhancements in Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-934369080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Allowing contingent workers (cost center procured) to record time on enterprise projects&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Modern project teams are a dynamic blend of internal employees and external contingent workers. A significant process gap existed for contingent workers who were procured via a cost center, as they couldn't use the standard “My Timesheet” application to record time against enterprise projects. This made it difficult to get a complete and timely picture of all labor hours and costs. With the 2602 release, we have closed this gap. Now, these contingent workers can use the very same “My Timesheet” application as internal employees to record their time against the projects they are staffed on, creating a unified experience for the entire team.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This enhancement delivers a unified and simplified process where all project resources, regardless of their employment type, use a single application for time recording, which improves the user experience. You can now capture every hour worked against your project demands in one central place, providing a more accurate and timely view of total project costs and progress. Furthermore, the system automates the creation of the corresponding service entry sheet and goods receipt upon timesheet approval, significantly reducing administrative overhead and ensuring your suppliers are paid accurately and on time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture3.png" style="width: 900px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364481i37B88CBFD95377B6/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture3.png" alt="Picture3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 3: &lt;EM&gt;Project-based and cost center-based contingent workers can record time seamlessly in the “Manage My Timesheet” application, ensuring consistent tracking and better visibility across all engagement types.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-737855575"&gt;Automatic removal of billing block for sales order billing plans&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Milestone billing is a fantastic way to align payments with project progress, but it has often been hampered by a manual step. Once a milestone was achieved, someone had to go into the sales order and manually remove the billing block to make that item available for invoicing, a delay that directly impacts cash flow. We have now fully automated this process. Building on a feature from our last release, the system now automatically removes the billing block from the corresponding billing plan item in the related sales order the moment a project manager confirms the completion of that milestone in the project.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By completely automating this process, you eliminate the manual hand-off and inherent delays, allowing you to invoice your customers the very moment a milestone is contractually met. This directly accelerates your order-to-cash cycle and improves cash flow. This automation also removes a tedious and error-prone manual task, freeing up your project controllers and sales administrators to focus their expertise on more strategic, value-added activities. The risk of human error is entirely eliminated, leading to a smoother, more reliable, and more accurate billing process from end to end.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_78lgh75t" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 4: &lt;EM&gt;For sales order billing plan items which are created based on enterprise project or WBS element milestones, the billing block is automatically removed when the related milestone is completed.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-541342070"&gt;Joule as project assistant (beta), planned to be available mid-March&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Setting up a new project can be a complex and time-consuming task, often requiring project managers to navigate between three or four different applications to define the scope, staff resources, and release the project for time recording. We are incredibly excited to give you a preview of how we are solving this with the future of project management: the &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Project Assistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This is our generative AI copilot, and we are starting with a beta agent designed to radically simplify the creation of internal projects. Instead of clicking through multiple screens, a project manager can simply ask Joule in natural language, e.g. "Create a new pre-sales project for the 'Rising Star' initiative, starting next week and lasting for one month.". Joule can then propose a template, adjust dates, staff the project, and release it – all within a single, conversational session.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This AI-powered assistant promises dramatic efficiency gains, condensing a multi-application process into a single, swift conversation that saves significant time and effort for your project managers. The intuitive, conversational nature of Joule makes project creation accessible to everyone, drastically reducing the learning curve and empowering users to initiate projects quickly and correctly. By leveraging templates from successful past projects, the Joule agent also helps ensure that new projects are set up consistently and in compliance with your company's standards right from the start. We are currently running a beta program for this and encourage you to get involved! Register for the Customer Engagement Initiative via this &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/4086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;landing page&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; as of March 15, 2026.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_q6ayc3eq" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 5: &lt;EM&gt;The AI-powered solution assists users in rapidly setting up projects by leveraging similar past projects when the volume is high, and projects are repetitive in nature.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-344828565"&gt;Other innovations in Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;We know how critical it is to have a clear, unified view of project financials. That's why we’ve &lt;STRONG&gt;introduced the company code currency into the Project Cost report&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Now, you can see a consolidated view of all your key cost figures including planned costs, actuals, commitments, and even project stock costs – all in a single, consistent currency. This provides a much clearer picture of your project's overall financial health and variance.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There is one important prerequisite to keep in mind: for the report to display in the company code currency, all the projects and WBS elements you select for that report must share the same company code. This ensures data integrity and accurate reporting. For a more detailed guide on this feature, I encourage you to check out the documentation on the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/ee9ee0ca4c3942068ea584d2f929b5b1/a75fe8e5c86d4faabe7b3e3e08589a21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Second, &lt;STRONG&gt;we’ve Improved system usability by segregating the profitability segment from settlement rules for clearer allocation and analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;. What does this mean for you? In the past, assigning profitability might have required you to set up a settlement rule. Now, for projects with revenue, you can assign the profitability segment directly to a billing WBS element using the "Assign" function. This is a much more direct and intuitive workflow. It saves you steps, simplifies the allocation process, and makes your analysis clearer and more efficient. As with all our features, you can find comprehensive details on this enhancement in the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/ee9ee0ca4c3942068ea584d2f929b5b1/5cedf7a110154465a91b04a7b221f311.html?version=2602.00" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, and this is something I’m personally very excited about, we are going beyond system features to build a stronger community. &lt;STRONG&gt;We are officially introducing the new CIP community – a collaborative space designed for our customers, partners, and SAP experts to connect&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The goal is to build a powerful network where we can all share ideas, discuss best practices, and co-innovate on the future of enterprise and collaborative project scenarios. This is your platform to influence the direction of our products and learn from your peers.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If you are interested in joining this community and helping shape the future of project management at SAP, please reach out to my colleagues, Anke Junker &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="mailto:anke.junker@sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;anke.junker@sap.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; or Varsha Chetan Manu &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="mailto:varsha.chetan.manu@sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;varsha.chetan.manu@sap.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, to get involved.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Cloud ERP 2602 release for EPPM is all about making your project management more connected, automated, and intelligent.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2255028"&gt;@tanvi_singhal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, great question. It depends on configuration we're talking about. SAP Composable Storefront is CMS Driven. So for feature flags and payment options, you can use CMS Component and Restriction in SAP Commerce server side to drive this configuration. It is native, no extra-development or/and customisation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regarding API endpoints, you should follow the same pattern as OCC API EndPoint or use my article.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>SAP Portugal ATCUD: Preparing for the 2026 SAF-T Tables Deprecation</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Evolution of Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAF-T (and similar frameworks) has evolved significantly from being a simple audit file into a complex legal requirement affecting local usage. In Portugal, the introduction of &lt;STRONG&gt;ATCUD&lt;/STRONG&gt; fundamentally changed how document series and number ranges must be defined and validated, creating a ripple effect across many SAP customizations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When ATCUD was first implemented, it enforced stricter rules regarding document series and numbering. To bridge the gap between older implementations and these new local requirements, SAP introduced specific tables and exception mechanisms as interim workarounds. While these measures helped customers adapt at the time, they created parallel sources of truth for document definitions, making governance, compliance, and testing significantly harder.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Technical Shift: What is Changing?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After nearly three years of live ATCUD operations, SAP is moving to "tidy up" the system by deprecating three legacy tables used in the past to provide as workaround to derive the same information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Planned for deprecation in 2026 are:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FIEU_MFI Map Document Type to Invoice Type (FI Invoice):&lt;/STRONG&gt; A legacy table used to hold mappings or exceptions for FI documents tied to SAF-T/ATCUD rules, often containing localized mappings that bypassed standard numbering rules.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FIPTC_DOC_EXC Define Number Ranges for Internal Documents:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A table used to store document exceptions and special handling for print, output, and validation workflows, frequently utilized for legacy processes or third-party add-ons.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FIEUD_SDGEN&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;STRONG&gt;Map Sales Category to Invoice Type:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A table where you define sales document categories that are not available by default. The corresponding invoice type is then inserted in the XML file.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Once these tables are deprecated, the only official customization sources for defining documents will be SIPT_NUMBR_FI_V2 (for Financial Accounting) and SIPT_NUMBR_SD_V2 (for Sales and Distribution) ... and don’t forget the series validation framework (transaction code: GLO_PT_SVC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;NOTE:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;These tables will remain available; however, they will no longer be relevant for SAF‑T reporting from 2026 onward.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why This Consolidation Matters&lt;/STRONG&gt; The primary goal of this deprecation is to remove redundancy and force a single authoritative configuration for series and number ranges that aligns with legal ATCUD requirements. Consolidating document definition into the SIPT_NUMBR_* tables offer several benefits:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consistency:&lt;/STRONG&gt; It reduces the chance of two subsystems defining the same document differently.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Simplified Audits:&lt;/STRONG&gt; It eliminates the complexity of checking multiple control points.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; It removes the risk of "less-informed users" relying on legacy settings that cause inconsistencies.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt; Start your discovery phase now by running an impact assessment for the legacy tables and mapping every dependency. Engaging your implementation partner early allows for proper planning and testing, ensuring the migration goes smoothly well before the 2026 deadline.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information, check SAP note &lt;STRONG&gt;3688051&lt;/STRONG&gt; and SAFT collective note &lt;STRONG&gt;1981139&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution for Public Cloud to be available soon&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope you enjoyed this information. Don't forget to leave your comments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Elsa&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I require an option in SAP Public Cloud to maintain a batch number range that is unique based on the material number. However, I am unable to find the relevant node in the configuration path. Please confirm whether this option is available in SAP Public Cloud or not.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Currently, I can only find the batch number range option at the client level. Due to this, if the GR for Material A is posted with Batch Number 1, then the GR for Material B is assigned Batch Number 2. After that, if I post GR again for Material A, Batch Number 3 is assigned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please confirm whether material-wise batch number range configuration is possible in SAP Public Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Bettina,&lt;BR /&gt;Thank you for sharing the information. I have a question regarding the Transport.&lt;BR /&gt;Since gCTS is described as "recommended", does that mean options other than gCTS can also be used?&lt;BR /&gt;is it possible to import and export transport files in the Discovery Package?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/893077"&gt;@jerrysam&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes in Public Cloud you can control this. What you are seeing posting invoices far above the Enhanced Limit Overall Limit typically happens when the invoice tolerance check for limit items is not configured or the message is configured only as a warning&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For Enhanced Limit PO items (item category E), SAP uses specific Logistics Invoice Verification (LIV) tolerance keys and message control:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tolerance key LA = checks whether the invoice exceeds the overall limit of the limit/enhanced-limit item (message M8298)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additionally, if you use performance periods and invoice directly against the PO (without SES/GR), tolerance key LD may be relevant (message M8297)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To make it an error (hard stop) at posting, you must do both:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;maintain the tolerance limit and&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;set the message severity to Error&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Note below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0002841906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://me.sap.com/notes/0002841906&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Steps to do:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Maintain the tolerance limit for LA:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In CBC go to 101947 Set Tolerance Limits&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="dawid90_0-1769161654524.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364485iE547A08DA8CFE860/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="dawid90_0-1769161654524.png" alt="dawid90_0-1769161654524.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Create/maintain an entry for your Company Code with tolerance key:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;LA (PO limit amount exceeded)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Set the upper limits so that any exceed over the overall limit is rejected. This meaning, the system should not accept exceeding the overall limit at all&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details in SAP Note below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0003052672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://me.sap.com/notes/0003052672&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Set message M8298 to Error not Warning&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Search for 102091 Define Message Types for Area M8 and set:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Message: M8 298 -&amp;gt;Type = Error&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="dawid90_1-1769161654529.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364486iA750691D3B228E48/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="dawid90_1-1769161654529.png" alt="dawid90_1-1769161654529.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="dawid90_2-1769161654532.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364488i876F5598C2AEB458/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="dawid90_2-1769161654532.png" alt="dawid90_2-1769161654532.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the step that turns the tolerance violation into a hard posting error instead of a warning&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Important process note (SES / GR indicator)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If your process is Lean Services with Service Entry Sheets:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When the PO item has Goods Receipt indicator set, SAP expects the SES to be the controlling document and some checks happen at SES time, not only at invoice time&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you allow invoices directly against the PO (no SES required) then the invoice tolerance setup above becomes even more critical&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Note below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0002841906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://me.sap.com/notes/0002841906&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. Quick test&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create an Enhanced Limit PO with Overall Limit = 5,000 EUR&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create supplier invoice with reference to that PO for 6,000 EUR&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Expected result after the setup: Posting is blocked with an error&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dawid&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;we are introducing ePP/DS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is a scenario where we need to have MTO on a distribution center, where products are usually procurement type F. We need the products to be first created uncovertible in a customer segement. The requirement is to plan in advance and to propagate demand to the manufacturing site and then to let SBC create the convertible STR once a Sales order is created.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately this is not possible with ePPDS. ePPDS cannot create planned orders for procurment type F which are moved to an uncovertible segment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The process&amp;nbsp; works perfectly fine with classic MRP. But classic MRP is about to be phased out of support. Therefore we try to build the solution based on MRP live and ePPDS.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have tested MRP live, and it successfully creates planned orders for procurement type F materials. However, there is an SAP &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ERP/85d3fce10e264972a0155c8b46ecf93b/1d4ee5514ec5c90ae10000000a44176d.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;ai=true" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;note&lt;/A&gt; that raises some concerns, stating that MRP live cannot create planned orders for materials with this procurement type. I would like to clarify whether this functionality will remain available in MRP live, as the behavior seems to contradict what is mentioned in the note.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Maybe someone from SAP can comment as the the behavior is contradicting the message in the note.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="PPDS_Panic_0-1769161959684.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364489i064093672DFEE0FF/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="PPDS_Panic_0-1769161959684.png" alt="PPDS_Panic_0-1769161959684.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

So if Language is part of your skills-led matching, it’s reasonable to maintain it in TIH.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3) Use JPB custom attribute mapping only for role expectations&lt;BR /&gt;Use the new capability for things that are genuinely role requirements / role context, for example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;certifications, tools/technologies, domain knowledge&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;working styles, preferences, motivations (your examples are spot-on)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;any “must-have / nice-to-have” capability signals&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nagesh Polu.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1659547625"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since SAP Commerce Cloud Framework Update JDK21, OAuth flow is totally different and more secure. We're not using anymore password authentication directly on OAuth stack.&amp;nbsp; In replacement, OAuth PKCE Flow is now used: &lt;A href="https://oauth.net/2/pkce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://oauth.net/2/pkce/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can run the playground example if you want to familiarize yourself with&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.oauth.com/playground/authorization-code-with-pkce.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.oauth.com/playground/authorization-code-with-pkce.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1463034120"&gt;Local setup&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Domain checking is more strict. And default &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;localhost&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; should be forgotten. In our example, it is based on Spartacus Sample data from B2C Electronics WebShop.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In your Operating System, you need to declare an explicit domain name&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 electronics-spa.local&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;In your Composable Storefront app, you need to review NodeJs start up command line to include your domain name&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;package.json
"start": "ng serve --host electronics-spa.local",&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;OCC API EndPoints need to be updated too&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;spartacus-configuration.module.ts
baseUrl: 'https://electronics-spa.local:9002',&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Commerce CORS rules need to be updated to allow Composable Storefront&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;corsfilter.default.allowedOrigins=http://electronics-spa.local:4200
corsfilter.commercewebservices.allowedOrigins=http://electronics-spa.local:4200
corsfilter.permissionswebservices.allowedOrigins=http://electronics-spa.local:4200
corsfilter.personalizationwebservices.allowedOrigins=http://electronics-spa.local:4200
corsfilter.acceleratorservices.allowedOrigins=http://electronics-spa.local:4200&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;And finally, you can import this following Impex to setup OAuth client parameters&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Public OAuth Client Credential
INSERT_UPDATE OAuthClientDetails; clientId[unique=true];public;authorities ;scope ;authorizedGrantTypes;registeredRedirectUri;loginPageUri   
;mobile_android_public;true;ROLE_CLIENT;basic;authorization_code,refresh_token ;http://electronics-spa.local:4200 ;/login&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;As you can notice, there's no password setup for this client. Authentication flow is using authorization code and SAP Commerce as IdP and login page host.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1266520615"&gt;Testing&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="http://electronics-spa.local:4200/electronics-spa/en/USD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://electronics-spa.local:4200/electronics-spa/en/USD/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 11.12.33.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364492iB05D6F82AE1DE2AF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 11.12.33.png" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 11.12.33.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you click on Sign in, you should be redirected to SAP Commerce where login page is hosted&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://electronics-spa.local:9002/authorizationserver/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://electronics-spa.local:9002/authorizationserver/login&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 11.13.36.png" style="width: 528px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364493i39F6214610466A14/image-dimensions/528x411/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="528" height="411" role="button" title="Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 11.13.36.png" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 11.13.36.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After password validation by SAP Commerce, temporary code is generated and send back to SAP Composable Storefront. Then, this code is sent to OAuth layer for validation.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi, I had the same issue just now.&lt;BR /&gt;But you have mentioned that, you submitted your result AFTER 2 hours.&lt;BR /&gt;when you click the access system button, from that moment, you had to complete the test BEFORE 2 hours.&lt;BR /&gt;I had similar issue where I had 10 minutes left BEFORE the 2 hr timer ended and am going to make a post on it&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Here’s a quick, zero-deploy way to test your app against a specific SAPUI5 version right from the browser.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The hack&lt;BR /&gt;- Append the UI5 version you want to your app URL:&lt;BR /&gt;- If your URL has no query parameters: ?sap-ui-version=1.43.2&lt;BR /&gt;- If it already has query parameters: &amp;amp;sap-ui-version=1.43.2&lt;BR /&gt;- Example: &lt;A href="https://my-app.example.com/index.html?sap-ui-version=1.120.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://my-app.example.com/index.html?sap-ui-version=1.120.3&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What it does&lt;BR /&gt;- When your app bootstraps SAPUI5 from the SAP CDN, adding sap-ui-version in the URL instructs UI5 to load its resources from that version.&lt;BR /&gt;- In practice, you can flip between versions to quickly check whether a bug is version-specific without touching your build or deployment pipeline.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How to confirm it worked&lt;BR /&gt;- Open the browser console and run:&lt;BR /&gt;- sap.ui.getVersionInfo().version&lt;BR /&gt;- You should see the version you specified in the URL.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Great use cases&lt;BR /&gt;- Reproducing customer issues on older UI5 versions&lt;BR /&gt;- Validating if a regression disappears on a newer patch&lt;BR /&gt;- Comparing behavior across minor versions without rebuilding&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Important notes and caveats&lt;BR /&gt;- It works when your app loads UI5 from the SAPUI5/OpenUI5 CDN (e.g., …/resources/sap-ui-core.js). If your app uses a self-hosted UI5 (e.g., from an ABAP front-end server), the parameter may not take effect.&lt;BR /&gt;- Some apps explicitly pin a version in the bootstrap URL (e.g., …/1.108.3/resources/sap-ui-core.js). In that case, the pinned version will win.&lt;BR /&gt;- Browser caching and accelerators can get in the way. If the version doesn’t seem to change, hard refresh the page (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) or clear cache.&lt;BR /&gt;- Don’t ship this as a “feature” for end users. It’s a developer convenience for testing and troubleshooting.&lt;BR /&gt;- Compatibility isn’t guaranteed across major/minor versions. Always validate critical flows when switching versions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bonus: other handy UI5 URL flags&lt;BR /&gt;- sap-ui-debug=true — loads non-minified sources for better stack traces&lt;BR /&gt;- sap-ui-language=en — forces a language for quick i18n checks&lt;BR /&gt;- sap-ui-theme=sap_fiori_3 — switches theme without redeploy&lt;BR /&gt;- sap-ui-xx-componentPreload=off — disables component preload during debugging&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Wrap-up&lt;BR /&gt;Next time you need to answer “Is this a UI5 issue or my app?” save yourself a build and try the URL trick. A simple &amp;amp;sap-ui-version=… can be the fastest path to clarity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Weltweit setzen Regierungen auf Digitalisierung, um Prozesse zu beschleunigen, Transparenz zu erhöhen und die Steuerkonformität in der Rechnungsstellung sicherzustellen. Für Unternehmen bedeutet das: Immer mehr Länder führen E‑Rechnungen, stattliche Steuerportale und neue Regulierungsvorgaben ein. Die Rechnungsstellungslandschaft wandelt sich grundlegend – und Compliance wird zum entscheidenden Faktor bei der Anbieterauswahl.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2046795843"&gt;Was ist ein E-Invoicing-Mandat?&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Jedes Land verfügt über eigene Vorschriften und setzt diese in seinen Digitalisierungs- und Steuer-Compliance-Prozessen unterschiedlich schnell um. Die elektronische Rechnungsstellung über staatliche Portale ist in Brasilien seit fast zwei Jahrzehnten Standard. Europa durchläuft denselben Wandel: Länder wie Italien (SDI), Ungarn (NAV) und andere EU-Mitgliedstaaten machen den elektronischen Austausch &amp;nbsp;schrittweise zur Pflicht.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;E-Invoicing-Mandate umfassen verschiedene Anforderungen: Formatierungsstandards, Reporting &amp;nbsp;an Behördenportale oder vollständig integrierte Rechnungsabwicklungssysteme. Dies macht die Rechnungsstellung insbesondere für international tätige Unternehmen komplexer. Unsere Kollege Christoph Neumann hat diese Szenarien in &lt;A href="https://wcc.on24.com/webcast/previewlobby?e=4905043&amp;amp;k=EFE9EFC8F57DC5814634DFBB91707DC7" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;einem aktuellen Webcast&lt;/A&gt; erörtert.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MarineMazoyer_0-1769163841064.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364497i274BCB1A4A1C296E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MarineMazoyer_0-1769163841064.png" alt="MarineMazoyer_0-1769163841064.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1850282338"&gt;Herausforderungen für Unternehmen&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Zur Erfüllung gesetzlicher Compliance-Vorgaben müssen Unternehmen fortlaufend auf sich ändernde Regularien reagieren, den aktuellen Stand sicherstellen und sich in behördliche Portale beziehungsweise staatliche Netzwerke integrieren. Dies führt häufig zu Redundanzen und macht bestehende E-Invoicing-Lösungen teilweise obsolet. Für Lieferanten bedeutet dies, Bestellungen in einem Portal zu erhalten, Rechnungen jedoch im vorgeschriebenen Regierungsportal einzureichen. Dieser Medienbruch erzeugt Ineffizienzen und schmälert den Mehrwert bei der Nutzung von B2B Netzwerke wie dem SAP Business Network.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1653768833"&gt;Unsere Strategie für die Zukunft&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Im kontinuierlichen Dialog mit unseren Kunden haben wir eine klare Vision und Strategie entwickelt, die wir bereits in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/spend-management-blogs-by-sap/sap-business-network-s-response-to-e-invoicing-mandates/ba-p/14069865" target="_blank"&gt;einem früheren Beitrag&lt;/A&gt; vorgestellt haben.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Das SAP Business Network geht über reine Compliance hinaus: Ziel ist es, die unternehmensübergreifende Zusammenarbeit zu optimieren und die Interaktion von Unternehmen mit Handelspartnern und Steuerbehörden weltweit mithilfe von SAP- und Partner-Anwendungen grundlegend zu modernisieren.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Zur Realisierung dieser Vision sind vier zentrale Innovationen geplant, die die Weiterentwicklung des SAP Business Network prägen werden:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Erstens öffnen wir das Netzwerk: Lieferanten erhalten einen &lt;STRONG&gt;Single Access Point für die Ausgangsrechnungen&lt;/STRONG&gt;, um rechtskonforme E-Rechnungen sowohl innerhalb als auch außerhalb des SAP Business Network an ihre Kunden zu senden.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Zweitens erweitern wir die &lt;STRONG&gt;Bearbeitung von Rechnungs Disputes&lt;/STRONG&gt; um integrierte, KI-gestützte Workflows, um manuellen Aufwand zu reduzieren und schnellere, nachvollziehbare Lösungen für Käufer und Lieferanten zu ermöglichen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Drittens erhöhen wir die &lt;STRONG&gt;Transparenz des Rechnungsstatus&lt;/STRONG&gt; durch präzisere Ablehnungs- und Fehlercodes inklusive klarer Begründungen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Viertens führen wir die regelbasierten &lt;STRONG&gt;Business-Rule-Prüfungen&lt;/STRONG&gt; für Käufer wieder ein, um Qualität und Konformität eingehender Rechnungen bereits beim Eingang sicherzustellen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Künftig werden Lieferanten das SAP Business Network als zentrale Plattform nutzen, um alle ihre Käufer zu erreichen – mit der Gewissheit, dass länderspezifische Anforderungen und komplexe Vorgaben zur Rechnungsstellung durchgängig berücksichtigt sind. Weniger Klärungsfälle, mehr Transparenz über Fehler- und Ablehnungsgründe sowie eine durchgängige, nahtlose E-Rechnungsstellung schaffen einen einheitlichen Kommunikationskanal zwischen Lieferanten und ihren Kunden.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1457255328"&gt;SAP Business Network: Mehr als nur Compliance&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Für SAP ist Compliance nicht das Ziel, sondern die Grundlage. Wir verfolgen regulatorische Weiterentwicklungen im Steuer- und Rechnungswesen kontinuierlich und setzen sie konsequent um. Durch sorgfältige Sorgfaltsprüfungen stellen wir die Einhaltung aller Vorgaben sicher. &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/buying-invoicing/sap-business-network-guide-to-invoicing/country-region-specific-tax-invoicing-process" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Unser Netzwerk ist daher bereits in Märkten rechtskonform&lt;/A&gt;, in denen die Nutzung staatlicher Portale verpflichtend ist oder besondere Anforderungen gelten.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Noch wichtiger: Das SAP Business Network schafft Mehrwert über reine Gesetzeskonformität hinaus. Lieferanten profitieren von flexiblen, intuitiven und robusten Funktionen, mit denen sie ihre Geschäftsprozesse automatisieren, optimieren und skalieren können. Dazu zählen unter anderem:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ein flexibles Angebots- und Preismodell&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-right" image-alt="277263_277263_l_srgb_s_gl.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/252388iBF3AD1A6CAFF7356/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="277263_277263_l_srgb_s_gl.jpg" alt="277263_277263_l_srgb_s_gl.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Eine intuitive Benutzeroberfläche und ein effizienter PO-to-Invoice -Prozess&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Transparenz über den Rechnungsstatus und Echtzeitbenachrichtigungen für eine reibungslose Kundenkommunikation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ein umfassendes Unternehmensprofil mit Compliance- und Nachhaltigkeitsinformationen&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Öffentliche und private elektronische Kataloge zur Vermarktung von Produkten und Services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Leistungsfähige Business-Intelligence-Funktionen und von der Community validierte Analysen zur Unterstützung strategischer Gespräche&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Wachstumschancen durch erhöhte Sichtbarkeit bei neuen Einkaufsorganisationen&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mit diesen Fähigkeiten und unserem klaren strategischen Fokus sind wir überzeugt, dass das Netzwerk die bevorzugte Plattform für Unternehmen bleibt, die über einfache Transaktionen hinaus nachhaltigen, strategischen Mehrwert anstreben.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Weitere Details finden Sie in unserer &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/pdf/asset/preview/TWxY9VF?ltr=a&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1177118" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;E-Invoicing-Strategie&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bleiben Sie dran!

    <content>mh i dont know if this should be default, that you can read any email of anybody , i think this is just a legal question? especially when you use a frontend app. in backend you are able to read the content of the mails if you have proper authorizations. the question is why you want to read the content of all emails? i am just admin, but for my understanding i dont need to read the content of the emails and dont know a role where you should be able to read all the contents of the emails of anybody</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;No, the IDoc-based incoming intercompany supplier invoice does not post directly against the original PO in Public Cloud. The journal entry is intentionally not linked to the PO. So the implication is PO history will only reflect goods receipt and not invoice receipt in intercompany scenarios.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Workarounds are&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Use reporting tools (e.g., Fiori apps for Intercompany Billing) to reconcile PO and invoice data.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;For PO-linked invoice postings, manual supplier invoice posting (via "Create Supplier Invoice" app) is required.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Check this SAP document &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/c473e4fb3bca4420badc0de89c520328/3c0b0e1a47cc402abf39742a9b4d0f98.html?form=MG0AV3&amp;amp;utm_source=copilot.com&amp;amp;ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Configure Intercompany Billing Communication&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Lakshmipathi_0-1769165593848.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364502i49836FE707E02924/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Lakshmipathi_0-1769165593848.png" alt="Lakshmipathi_0-1769165593848.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;which confirms this automatic posting is financial-only.

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1917713215"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Detailed Problem Description / Question&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m looking for guidance (or an SAP KBA reference) around sending notifications from SAP SuccessFactors to Microsoft Teams via SAP CPI, specifically when the source is a custom portlet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our scenario, we have a custom portlet in SuccessFactors that displays an alert or status message on the SuccessFactors home page. Unlike standard SuccessFactors Teams notifications, this custom portlet does not automatically trigger a Teams notification.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The requirement is as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;A notification or alert occurs in a custom SuccessFactors portlet&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;This event should be picked up by SAP CPI&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;CPI should then send a notification to a Microsoft Teams channel (webhook)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;At this stage, we understand that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;SuccessFactors does not natively generate MS Teams notifications for custom portlets&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any notification would likely require custom integration logic (e.g. OData, Integration Center extract, or custom API trigger)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;CPI would be responsible for transforming the message and forwarding it to Microsoft Teams&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;My questions are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there an official SAP KBA or documentation that confirms custom portlets do not support native notifications?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Are there recommended or supported approaches for enabling CPI to detect an event or change from a custom portlet?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Has anyone successfully implemented a CPI → Microsoft Teams notification for a custom SuccessFactors object or portlet, and if so, what approach was used?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Adele Beets&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi Lakshmipathi, Thank you for the clarification. Currently, 6.72% is the correct tax rate. However, due to a mistake, the rate was changed to 6% with a validity date of 01/20/2026. Once this was identified, the tax rate was corrected back to 6.72% on 01/21/2026. As you mentioned, no one has direct access to update configuration in the Production system. Additionally, the change migration cannot be skipped or selectively excluded; therefore, this change will also be transported along with the other changes. For reference, I have attached the details showing the tax rate validity periods.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The Business Partner Grouping (BU_GROUP) field cannot be set as mandatory because it follows predefined system logic:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If no BP Grouping is chosen and no BP number is entered, the system automatically assigns the standard internal grouping.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If no BP Grouping is chosen but a BP number is manually entered, the system automatically assigns the standard external grouping&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

As per the screenshot, the document is still in Released status. However, it is not clear whether the Overall Release configuration has been removed for this particular document type.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please check the configuration SSCUI-102911 (Activate Flexible Workflow for Purchase Requisitions). If the Overall Release checkbox is enabled for the document type, uncheck it and maintain only the Scenario-Based Workflow checkbox. After making this change, try creating the Purchase Requisition again.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If any clarification is needed, please comment with the relevant details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regards,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Vinith K&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I am using Crystal Reports XI (11) with Delphi 7 and the TCrpe component.&lt;BR /&gt;The Crystal runtime is correctly installed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When I open the report preview using:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;crpe1.Execute;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;the preview window shows only three buttons:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Print → sends the report directly to the Windows default printer&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Print Setup → allows only page settings (paper size, orientation, margins)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Export → exports the report to a file&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is no option to select a printer in the preview or in the Print Setup dialog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Crystal Reports 8.5, the Print Setup dialog included printer selection, so the user could choose the printer after previewing the report.&lt;BR /&gt;In Crystal Reports XI, this option no longer exists.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Because of this change, the user is forced to select a printer before previewing (using crpe1.Printer.Prompt), even in cases where the user may only want to preview and not print at all.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This creates a poor user experience compared to version 8.5.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My questions are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why was printer selection removed from Print Setup in Crystal Reports XI?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there any supported way to enable printer selection after preview, like in version 8.5?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Or is this a hard limitation of Crystal Reports XI with no workaround?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;for some reason I didn't get your reply notice to my email. Thank you for having time to give me this. I have been trying to figure this out with so many ways (and read so many documents) and thinking am I the only one having this problem. All how-to blogs seem to be working only for need of maintainable table or for custom app but I mainly focus on getting data to the forms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm facing lot's of issues in getting "extra" information to the forms which doesn't "belong" to them automatically in addition to this table problem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before I just added a new parameter to calling program and/or table and now everything seems so difficult. Before I could retrieve almost anything from anywhere and now I'm stuck with these predefined views which doesn't have all data that was available before.&amp;nbsp;Getting one simple field from LIKP can cause a bunch of actions/fields/even custom view which seems so unnessary for small things.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Integration Advisor – Create 1:1 Mapping Elements in MAG Editor</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this blog post, I'd like to share with you a great new feature that we have recently delivered: in the Mapping Guideline (MAG) Editor, you can now use the &lt;EM&gt;Create 1:1 Mappings&lt;/EM&gt; feature to automatically map the same nodes in the source and target subtrees.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1021363172" id="toc-hId-1787616678"&gt;How to Use the New Feature&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the SAP Customer Influence program, we have learned that you, as our customers, frequently need the feature to create 1:1 mappings between identical message structures (see here for more details:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/339933" target="_self" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Link&lt;/A&gt;). A typical use case for such a feature would be: you may need to do a few modifications to a message payload while keeping the rest unchanged. In such a case, you would need to define identical mappings for most of the message nodes and define a few diverging mapping elements for the required modifications.&amp;nbsp;Our new feature helps to speed up the definition of the identical mapping elements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the header of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Mapping List&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;section, you will find the new &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Create 1:1 Mappings&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;button. To use it, you need to select group nodes on the source and target sides. To do so, either click first on the desired source node and then on the target node or draw a mapping line between the desired group nodes. Now, you can click on the &lt;EM&gt;Create 1:1 Mappings&lt;/EM&gt; button to apply the new feature. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;See the screenshot below for an illustration. In the example, we want to create identical mappings for the subtrees of &lt;EM&gt;Party[BUY]&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;Buyer&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="blog-screenshot-1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/357807iFD5E71CA1524501D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="blog-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="blog-screenshot-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The result of this action is shown in the following screenshot:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="blog-screenshot-2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/357808iCDC4E171DF59F9D5/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="blog-screenshot-2.jpg" alt="blog-screenshot-2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mapping elements have been created for the identical nodes &lt;EM&gt;Name&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;Address&lt;/EM&gt;, as well as for most child nodes of &lt;EM&gt;Address&lt;/EM&gt;. Neither the source node &lt;EM&gt;partyRole&lt;/EM&gt; nor the target node &lt;EM&gt;PartyID&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;has a matching node and therefore no mappings have been created for them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In order to match source and target nodes, the following rules are applied:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Direct child nodes of the selected group nodes (like &lt;EM&gt;Name&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;Address&lt;/EM&gt;) are matched if they have the same identifier and the same namespace prefix (if applicable). More precisely, they are matched if they have the same &lt;EM&gt;XML Node Name&lt;/EM&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note: In the MIG Editor, click on any node and navigate to the right-hand side to the tab &lt;EM&gt;Details&lt;/EM&gt;, section &lt;EM&gt;Identifier Information&lt;/EM&gt;. There, you will find the &lt;EM&gt;XML Node Name&lt;/EM&gt; among other identifying information for the node.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Matching also works if the nodes use the Integration Advisor qualifier concept (with the same qualifier values).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Moreover, matching is also applied to child nodes of child nodes (like &lt;EM&gt;Street&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;City&lt;/EM&gt;). Here, the same rules as before are applied, but this requires that their parent node (here &lt;EM&gt;Address&lt;/EM&gt;) has been matched as well.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;And let me finally add a few more technical details:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The feature can be applied to complete message structures (by selecting both root nodes) but also to any other source and target group nodes (as in our example). In the latter case, group nodes do not need to have the same identifier.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New mapping elements are only created for previously unmapped target nodes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Existing mapping elements are not modified or removed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;In our example above, a constant value had previously been defined for the target node &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;AddressTypeCode&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, and this mapping remained unchanged (although there was a matching node on the source side).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The newly created mapping elements behave similarly to manually created mapping elements; in particular, Code Value Mapping or Date Time Conversion is automatically chosen if applicable. In our example above, the mapping element for &lt;EM&gt;CountryCode&lt;/EM&gt; is a Code Value Mapping.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-431822657" id="toc-hId-1591103173"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This blog post explains our new feature for creating 1:1 mappings in the MAG Editor. This feature will help you work even more efficiently with Integration Advisor when you need to automatically map complete message structures or subtrees.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-235309152" id="toc-hId-1394589668"&gt;Further reading&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration/sap-cloud-integration/working-with-mapping-guideline-mag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration/sap-cloud-integration/working-with-mapping-guideline-mag&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/integration-advisor-overview-of-components-for-building-b2b-integration/ba-p/13512772" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/integration-advisor-overview-of-components-for-...&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello SAP Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m experiencing a strange issue in SAP (SAPGUI 800), some UI elements no longer work properly:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;STRONG&gt;SE80&lt;/STRONG&gt;, within the &lt;STRONG&gt;Repository Browser&lt;/STRONG&gt;, I cannot switch between function groups, packages, or other objects. Instead of the usual content, I only see a blank box.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similarly, &lt;STRONG&gt;Workflow tasks&lt;/STRONG&gt; appear completely blank.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="RicardoRomero_1_0-1769169870311.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364559i9F7B038738F840B1/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="RicardoRomero_1_0-1769169870311.png" alt="RicardoRomero_1_0-1769169870311.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I suspect this may be related to &lt;STRONG&gt;installing Adobe Designer for Adobe Forms&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but I’m not entirely sure.&amp;nbsp;I think it started malfunctioning since I installed it, although I only noticed it days later.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I couldn’t even access the SAP Community page at first—it kept giving me a “page not found” error. After clearing cookies, I was able to log in, though I’m not sure if it’s related; it might just be a coincidence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Has anyone seen similar issues with HTML controls in SAP? Any suggestions on how to restore the normal behavior would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

This may however cause other issues elsewhere because IE is no longer really supported.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cheers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Bärbel&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2215509"&gt;@Guna_M&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What you have described is good for sales functional object but for public cloud you need to consider a different approach. The public cloud does not permit the implementation of enhancements through SE18 or 19. Public cloud offers the use of Custom Logic with the released cloud BAdIs and configuration features that exist specifically for validity date proposal. You can implement both requirements limit the impact to your sales inquiries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the Auto set Validity Date to Enquiry Date plus 30 days, the best practice is to use flexible proposal of validity dates. This is standard configuration for proposing the valid to date for sales inquiries and quotations, based on calendar and offset rules. See &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a376cd9ea00d476b96f18dea1247e6a5/be5fb7078828412dbd273f215a7aa110.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Flexible Proposal of Validity Dates&lt;/A&gt; for more details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Doing that will help you avoid changing a standard field through a BAdI, which is generally not supported for many standard fields in public cloud. See &lt;A href="https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2733433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;KBA 2733433&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following Blog: &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/s-4hana-q2c-sales-flexibility-determine-valid-to-date-on-sales-inquiry-and/ba-p/13536958" target="_blank"&gt;S/4HANA Q2C Sales Flexibility – Determine Valid-to Date on Sales Inquiry and Sales Quotation via CPF&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; also provides some insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In your CBC, search for Flexible Proposal of Validity Dates, create a rule for sales inquiry and restrict it to document type IN. Then set the offset rule to propose valid To = Enquiry Date plus 30 days, save and publish.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_0-1769170761689.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364583iAACF3A2D4DABB2AC/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_0-1769170761689.png" alt="Chris1973_0-1769170761689.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For you to Freeze Item Quantity after Validity Date has expire, you cannot make only one standard field read only while keeping others editable using classic GUI exits. However, you can block saving when a user tries to change quantity after the validity date. That is the usual public cloud pattern. You may consider using SD_SLS_CHECK_BEFORE_SAVE to validate the document and stop saving with an error message. In the BAdI logic check SalesDocumentType is equls to IN, only then run the validity check but do not run it for quotations or orders. See &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a376cd9ea00d476b96f18dea1247e6a5/66a2f4107e754be68a458408eb332d91.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) for Sales Documents&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3509178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;KBA 3509178&lt;/A&gt; for more details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is a step guidance:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Custom Logic app,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_1-1769170778906.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364584i7C4948771B10C7AB/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_1-1769170778906.png" alt="Chris1973_1-1769170778906.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;create a new implementation for SD_SLS_CHECK_BEFORE_SAVE, add a filter condition for Sales Document Type = IN&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_2-1769170796784.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364585iC94B5918D5DC71FB/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_2-1769170796784.png" alt="Chris1973_2-1769170796784.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can implement logic as you need e.g.,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If today is greater than Valid To date, if quantity was changed, raise an error message and prevent save.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_3-1769170897089.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364587i4201BE5514843199/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_3-1769170897089.png" alt="Chris1973_3-1769170897089.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me know if you have further questions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chris&lt;/P&gt;</content>

We do not want to check that upfront for all items of the list&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;2. We wand to do the check in that moment a user requests the draft.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;We moved the check into the framework method LOCK, here we are allowed to raise FAILED an Reported.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I am not 100% sure that this is the best place for "Draft Pre-Checks" but I did not find any better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Pre-Checks are not possible for EDIT actions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thanks go out to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/37925"&gt;@Sschlegel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp; Björn Schulz&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;when we try to start SAP, it does not come up&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP instance fails to start when SNC (Kerberos) is enabled – work processes abort during SNC initialization&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;System / Environment&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;OSS: Linux (RHEL 9)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Database: Oracle 19c&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;SNC configured with Kerberos (MIT Kerberos, GSS-API)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;snc/gssapi_lib set to /usr/lib64/libgssapi_krb5.so&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;snc/identity/as configured with machine principal&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;The SAP ABAP instance fails to start when SNC is enabled.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The startup stops during work process initialization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;When SNC parameters are disabled, the SAP system starts successfully.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Observed Behavior&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP instance startup proceeds normally:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;DIspatcher starts&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Database connection succeeds&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Work processes are spawned&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;During work process startup, SNC initialization begins.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SNC library is successfully loaded:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;SncInit(): found snc/gssapi_lib=/usr/lib64/libgssapi_krb5.so&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;File "/usr/lib64/libgssapi_krb5.so" dynamically loaded as GSS-API v2 library.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Immediately after loading the GSS-API library, the work process terminates with signal 6 (SIGABRT).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This behavior repeats for multiple work processes, causing the instance to fail startup&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;SncInit(): Initializing Secure Network Communication (SNC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SncInit(): found snc/gssapi_lib=/usr/lib64/libgssapi_krb5.so&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;File "/usr/lib64/libgssapi_krb5.so" dynamically loaded as GSS-API v2 library.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;/usr/lib64/libc.so.6(abort+0xd3)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;/oracle/SID/19/lib/libclntsh.so.11.1(krb5int_key_register+0xb1)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;/oracle/SID/19/lib/libclntsh.so.11.1(gss_krb5int_lib_init+0x29)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SncPDLInit()&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SncInit()&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ThSncInit()&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ThInit()&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;abort()&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;System remains unavailable&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Disabling SNC (snc/enable = 0) allows the system to start normally&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although SAP loads the configured GSS-API library successfully, the stack trace shows that Kerberos-related functions are being executed from the Oracle client library (libclntsh.so) at the time of the abort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;QUESTIONS??&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why SAP work processes abort during SNC initialization after successfully loading the configured GSS-API library&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How SAP expects SNC / Kerberos to behave when Oracle client libraries are present in the same process&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any known SAP Notes, restrictions, or supported configurations for:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SNC (Kerberos)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oracle 19c client&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Linux platforms&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/107963" target="_self"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;harjeetjudge&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, great work !&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have a question for you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My SAP IAS and IPS infrastructure is located in SAP data centers in Sterling North Virginia (US3), which I understand is Neo.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Everything is already integrated and working with SSFF, although the user synchronization API used in IPS is OData, which I understand must be migrated to SCIM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My specific question is whether it is feasible to implement this Joule service with our current IAS/IPS infrastructure on the NEO (US3) data center in Sterling North Virginia, or whether for some technical reason it is also mandatory to migrate IAS/IPS to another Data Center in Multi-Cloud (Cloud Foundry) like AWS or Azure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you very much in advance and best regards.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sebastián.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Good afternoon, I am conducting research in SAP Public Cloud, in the Balance Sheet/Income Statement - Multidimensional application, on whether it is possible to modify the FS Leaf External ID field, as it does not allow me to do so (at least from the application).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I want to modify or, failing that, create the description because it shows the chart of accounts + account relationship, and I would like to delete the YCOA part, but from what I have read, it is an SAP standard and cannot be modified/created.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I don't know if I am missing some configuration setting where I could create or modify it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I mention this in case I am missing something and someone can help me.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am attaching a photo with the field I want to modify or create, if possible, marked.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regard,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Juan Antonio&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="foto.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364596i40F9AF34DAA2A609/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="foto.png" alt="foto.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I created a revision using OIOB t-code and I can see the entry in the table, T352R.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, I cant see the same entry when I go back to OIOB. There are no entries there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How do I resolve this?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks and Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Anirudh&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I have a main program (ZMANISH_BACKGROUND) which has a selection screen as shown.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="manish_malakar0316_0-1769170849848.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364586i81E79E5EBF0869A6/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="manish_malakar0316_0-1769170849848.png" alt="manish_malakar0316_0-1769170849848.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The above program will be executed in the background via SM36. A variant will be created after entering the plant and date and this particular variant will be provided in SM36 with the jobname and the program name.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="manish_malakar0316_1-1769170999113.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364588i786D4EA873D12B36/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="manish_malakar0316_1-1769170999113.png" alt="manish_malakar0316_1-1769170999113.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The main program&amp;nbsp;ZMANISH_BACKGROUND is submitting another program&amp;nbsp;ZSCM_AUTO_CONF3_NEW which is also triggered in the background. This program has no parameters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the job is scheduled and I go to SM37 I can see 2 jobs, one for the main program and the other for the called program. Below are my questions:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1) Since both programs are running in the background, 2 jobs are getting created, one with a spool (ZSCM_AUTO_CONF3_NEW) and the other without a spool (ZMANISH_BACKGROUND).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="manish_malakar0316_2-1769171548118.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364592i3239868ABC4EAA75/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="manish_malakar0316_2-1769171548118.png" alt="manish_malakar0316_2-1769171548118.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is it possible to delete the job without the spool programmatically ? The functional wants only the job with the spool to be displayed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2) The job without the spool displays the variant name which was saved .&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="manish_malakar0316_3-1769171881291.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364594i958D1B38D01F3DFB/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="manish_malakar0316_3-1769171881291.png" alt="manish_malakar0316_3-1769171881291.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However the job with the spool displays a system generated number as the variant&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="manish_malakar0316_5-1769172294485.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364597iE3E40A91DC25965C/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="manish_malakar0316_5-1769172294485.png" alt="manish_malakar0316_5-1769172294485.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is it possible to insert the variant 'MANISH'&amp;nbsp; to the job with the spool , instead of the random number being generated ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Manish&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi Chris, Thank you for your detailed explanation and guidance. It is very clear now. I understand that in the public cloud, we should use Flexible Proposal of Validity Dates for auto-setting the Validity Date, and SD_SLS_CHECK_BEFORE_SAVE BAdI for preventing quantity changes after the validity period. I will follow your approach and implement the logic specifically for Sales Inquiries (document type IN). Really appreciate your time and help! Best regards, Guna</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/155350"&gt;@Halser_T&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below is a pragmatic CALM-friendly way to structure data migration work for Public Cloud implementations. It is aligned with how SAP Cloud ALM is designed to be used SAP Activate template tasks + Requirements -&amp;gt;User Stories/Tasks + timeboxes/milestones + workstreams/tags&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Question 1. &lt;/STRONG&gt;How should migration objects be represented in SAP Cloud ALM?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recommended modeling works well in real projects&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use a 3-layer structure:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Requirement (scope + quality gate)&lt;BR /&gt;Use Requirements to capture the what and how-good at a level that business/data owners can sign off:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;object/domain scope (what’s in / what’s out)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;data owners and sources&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;acceptance criteria (reconciliation rules, tolerances, completeness, audit evidence)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;dependencies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/defining-requirements?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/defining-requirements&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/approving-requirements?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/approving-requirements&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. User Story (deliverable outcome per object or object-group)&lt;BR /&gt;Use User Stories to represent the migration deliverable you want to manage end-to-end for example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Business Partner master migrated and reconciled&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Material master migrated and validated&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Open AR items migrated and balanced&lt;BR /&gt;User stories work well because Cloud ALM provides traceability views that roll up progress from sub-tasks/tests to show readiness&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/user-story-traceability?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/user-story-traceability&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. (Sub-)Tasks (execution steps)&lt;BR /&gt;Put the operational steps into sub-tasks under the user story or project tasks where it’s cross-cutting. SAP Cloud ALM explicitly supports tasks derived from SAP Activate, manually defined project tasks and tasks generated from requirements&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/task-management?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/task-management&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/consuming-sap-activate-tasks?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/consuming-sap-activate-tasks&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use Project Tasks for work that is not a single object outcome:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;migration tooling/setup (templates, connectivity, staging approach)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;data governance, cleansing rules, naming conventions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;cross-object cutover activities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;runbook creation, hypercare checklist&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Question 2.&lt;/STRONG&gt; How to structure activities across target environments (D / Q / P)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cloud ALM does not force a single right pattern but it does give you strong organizing points: phases/sprints/milestones (timeboxes), workstreams, tags, and a deployment plan/system landscape linkage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/project-planning-timeboxes?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/project-planning-timeboxes&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/implementation/sap-cloud-alm-implementation-expert-portal/project-management.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/implementation/sap-cloud-alm-implementation-expert-portal/project-management.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A pattern that scales without exploding the backlog&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keep one User Story per migration object or object group and use:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Milestones for migration cycles (Mock 1, Mock 2, Dress Rehearsal, Cutover)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tags or naming convention to mark environment D/Q/P&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sub-tasks for each environment only where it adds control&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Example one object user story:&lt;BR /&gt;User Story: Business Partner migrated and reconciled&lt;BR /&gt;Sub-tasks (typical):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mapping and transformation rules finalized (D)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Trial load + error remediation (D)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mock Load #1 + reconciliation pack (Q)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mock Load #2 / Dress rehearsal + timing evidence (Q)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cutover load + reconciliation + business sign-off (P)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This keeps the object story stable, while execution iterates through environments and cycles&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use environment-separated groupings only if:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;different teams own D vs Q vs P execution and&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;you need independent scheduling/ownership/visibility per environment&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Question 3.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Common templates / proven structuring approaches&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Template A: Data domain -&amp;gt; objects -&amp;gt; cycles&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Workstream: Data Migration and optionally sub-workstreams like Finance / Logistics / Sales&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Requirement: Finance master data migrated&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;User Stories: G/L accounts, cost centers, profit centers, etc.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Milestones: Mock 1 / Mock 2 / Dress rehearsal / Cutover&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best when you have strong data domain ownership and want clear object accountability&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Template B: Migration wave -&amp;gt;objects best for phased rollout / multiple countries&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Requirement: Wave 1 data scope migrated (country/site/business unit scope)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;User Stories: either (a) one per object in wave or (b) one per wave with object sub-tasks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Milestones: Wave go-live readiness gates, plus mock cycles inside the wave&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best when rollout governance is wave-driven&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Template C: Cutover-cycle centric best when go-live risk is the driver&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a Cutover-focused cluster of tasks in the Deploy phase:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;final extraction&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;delta logic&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;production load steps&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;reconciliation &amp;amp; sign-off&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;go/no-go decision points&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cloud ALM’s timesbox concept (phases/milestones) supports exactly this style of cutover gating&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/project-planning-timeboxes?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/project-planning-timeboxes&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Cloud ALM Project Management capabilities overview workstreams, tags, timeboxes, deployment plan/system groups are explicitly called out&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Cloud ALM help topics around Tasks/Requirements/timeboxes tasks from SAP Activate, project tasks, requirement-generated tasks, phases/sprints/milestones&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/implementation/sap-cloud-alm-implementation-expert-portal/project-management.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/implementation/sap-cloud-alm-implementation-expert-portal/project-management.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/task-management?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/task-management&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/project-planning-timeboxes?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/project-planning-timeboxes&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/approving-requirements?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/approving-requirements&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/consuming-sap-activate-tasks?ai=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/consuming-sap-activate-tasks&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dawid&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Learning SAP BTP with Terraform: What Should Come Next?</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I’m relatively new to the SAP ecosystem. Recently, I started learning SAP BTP and paired it with Terraform to understand how modern SAP landscapes can be automated using Infrastructure as Code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The journey wasn’t smooth. As a beginner in SAP, understanding how BTP accounts, subaccounts, entitlements, directories, and services fit together took time. Adding Terraform on top of that introduced a new set of challenges—provider behavior, state management, and errors that weren’t always obvious from documentation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Despite the ups and downs, this experience helped me build a solid foundation in both SAP BTP and Terraform. I now have a clearer understanding of how SAP BTP environments are structured and how they can be managed in a scalable, repeatable way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now I’m at a crossroads, and this is where I’d really like input from the community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From a &lt;STRONG&gt;market and demand perspective&lt;/STRONG&gt;, what should I focus on next?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Should I go deeper into &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP services&lt;/STRONG&gt; like CAP, Integration Suite, or Extension Suite?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there stronger demand for &lt;STRONG&gt;DevOps-style roles&lt;/STRONG&gt;, focusing on CI/CD, automation, and governance in SAP BTP?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Would combining &lt;STRONG&gt;BTP + security, identity, and authorization&lt;/STRONG&gt; be more valuable?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Or is expanding into &lt;STRONG&gt;multi-cloud Terraform and platform engineering&lt;/STRONG&gt; the smarter move?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As someone early in the SAP journey, I want to invest time in skills that are not just interesting, but also relevant and in demand.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking forward to insights from people already working in the SAP BTP and cloud automation space.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every time I enter transaction code IH01, the Plant field is prefilled. How can I make this field come up empty for all users?&lt;BR /&gt;If a variant has been created, how was this done without entering the FL field? I have seen solutions related to creating a variant with SAP_TCODE_IH01; however, in that case the FL field needs to be filled in as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MuratTnrkt_0-1769174347440.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/364630i38B6A4E587FA90E9/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MuratTnrkt_0-1769174347440.png" alt="MuratTnrkt_0-1769174347440.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, billing output (Form Language and Form Country/Region) is determined exclusively by customer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;‑&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;related business partners such as the Bill&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;‑&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;to Party and Payer.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the scenario where the Bill&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;‑&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;to Party is in one and the employee processing is in another country, the system will generate the invoice according to Bill‑to Party's&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;country and language rules&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. The employee processing's country has no influence on billing output, as internal employee roles are not considered in Output Management determination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can also refer to the following&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;‑&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;provided documentation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Output Management for Sales and Billing Documents&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Billing Documents – App Documentation&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Invoice Forms &amp;amp; Country&lt;SPAN&gt;‑&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Specific Templates&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Country/Region&lt;SPAN&gt;‑&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Specific Functions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Form Language issues explained by SAP experts&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Community&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I am looking for some ideas on how you manage nominations for learning programs or initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We run cohorts of programs covering leadership or management etc. These are taken by employees who either put themselves forward, or who are nominated by their manager.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How do you, or how would you suggest, we manage this?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Currently an email is sent outside of the LMS to advise people of the initiative and we ask them to complete a MS Form. This is obviously very manual to manage, plus it doesn't connect to the HCM so doesn't have any employee data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The record of the attendance is held within the LMS after the event.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks, Sam&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello, we also get same issue and we have SAP ECC 606, since yesterday with several transactions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We downgrade SAP GUI 8 to patch level 2 and it worked, from patch level 3 to patch level 16 (released today) it doesn't work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope SAP will fix soon.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;With Package Integration 1.4.0 (December 2025), the Advanced Event Mesh Adapter for SAP Integration Suite delivers several noteworthy updates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of these has been requested repeatedly by customers, partners, and SAP architects working in hybrid landscapes:&lt;BR /&gt;official support for on-premise connectivity via the SAP Cloud Connector.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition to this key enhancement, the release also includes other technical changes, such as an update to the default acknowledgment mode.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s New in Package Integration 1.4.0? &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1917715106"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":keycap_1:"&gt;1️⃣&lt;/span&gt;On-Premise Connectivity via SAP Cloud Connector&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The AEM Adapter can now &lt;STRONG&gt;officially route traffic to on-premise systems through the SAP Cloud Connector&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This enables a supported hybrid architecture where:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;S/4HANA on-prem produces events&lt;BR /&gt;SAP AEM distributes them&lt;BR /&gt;Network security remains intact&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Important note from the official release notes:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Avoid mixing proxy configurations within the same tenant to prevent unexpected routing behavior.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is especially critical in complex hybrid tenants.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1721201601"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":keycap_2:"&gt;2️⃣&lt;/span&gt;Change of Default Acknowledgment Mode&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The default acknowledgment mode has changed from:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Automatic Immediate&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatic On Exchange Complete&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technical implications:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clearer delivery semantics&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;improved error handling&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Better alignment with enterprise-grade integration scenarios&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Package Integration 1.4.0 introduces multiple technical improvements.&lt;BR /&gt;The Cloud Connector support for the Advanced Event Mesh Adapter is a long-requested and architecturally significant enhancement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It enables a clean, supported reference architecture to connect&amp;nbsp;SAP S/4HANA on-premise directly to SAP Advanced Event Mesh, using SAP Cloud Connector as the secure hybrid backbone.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For SAP architects, this removes a major blocker when designing modern, event-driven hybrid landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;</content>
