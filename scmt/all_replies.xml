    <content>hello, thanks for your advises. I have other intersting finding- 1.determination of tax code works on sales order correctly. 2. I use for billing app. Create Billing Documents - VF04 - with option Collective billing document it saved billing document with correct tax code determination and all relevant data were saved correctly. 3. But when I did Release to accounting- tax code and material tax classification has been redermined incorrectly</content>

The joint study by SAP Business Consulting and Kühne Logistics University clearly shows that companies who tightly integrate their processes digitally can prevent bottlenecks, reduce costs, and increase service levels. At the same time, however, the survey also makes it clear that the ambitions of many companies in the field of transport and warehouse logistics for 2035 are surprising – less because the technologies are lacking, but because their implementation is difficult alongside current operational challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Global competitive pressure is increasing, and the pressure to act in terms of efficiency and cost optimization remains high. Energy, transport and staff are becoming more expensive, growth stimuli in the industrial sector are scarce in many developed countries, and efficiency is no longer achieved incidentally. Even small improvements in lead times, utilization, or error rates have an immediate impact on delivery dates and costs. In manufacturing companies, logistics is the backbone of stable processes, and standstill is therefore not an option. At the same time, the shortage of skilled workers often exacerbates the pressure to act: In Germany and other countries, jobs in warehouses and transport are increasingly difficult to fill, especially where processes are still lived manually and fragmented.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tasks must be solved differently in the future – through higher automation, targeted assistance systems, the use of AI, and the courageous rethinking of processes. Against the backdrop of increased pressure to act, the results of a survey conducted in April 2025 show a mixed picture: 39 percent of respondents expect significantly stronger digitalization and data-driven warehouse processes with significant advances in responsiveness and transparency by 2035. 28 percent expect the use of advanced technologies such as autonomous vehicles or drones in transport and material flow scenarios; another 28 percent see AI agents as integral support tools for dispatchers, warehouse managers and drivers. In addition, 20 percent expect connected ecosystems with real-time data exchange across company boundaries. So, the direction is clear, but expectations seem moderate compared to the technological perspectives and already existing use cases. One of the possible reasons: the vision exists, but there is often a lack of clear implementation plans, as time, know-how and resources are scarce. Many companies are lagging behind with the modernization of their processes and systems and can therefore integrate the potential of innovative technologies and real-time data into their daily work and decision-making to the required extent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the same time, the survey reveals weaknesses in the current situation: Only 17 percent of the 180 surveyed companies use real-time data comprehensively to optimize warehousing. Only 9 percent are committed to real-time transparency in the transportation sector with accurate arrival time forecasts, and only 6 percent have established collaborative planning and execution models with partners. It is positive to mention that 19% of companies have already gained initial experience with generative AI – so this is a new field where progress has been made. Overall, however, the figures show that the comprehensive implementation of digital innovations in practice still falls significantly short of the possibilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What needs to be done? Successful innovation requires a clear, prioritized strategy and readiness to adapt processes and technologies, supported by comprehensive and high-quality data, intelligent analytics, and effective orchestration. On the one hand, a resilient digital backbone which integrates process and sensor data into a consistent situational picture across transport, yard and warehouse is required. Orchestration within the company as well as data exchange across company boundaries is crucial. This data forms the basis for AI-driven decision logic, such as predictive ETA forecasts, dynamic capacity and slot controls, and anomaly detection. AI agents should perform routine tasks, structure exceptions, and provide appropriate options for action. In addition, AI technologies are increasingly moving into physical logistics processes, where many experts expect further groundbreaking developments – both in the software and hardware sectors. This includes increasingly flexible robots and cobots paired with innovative business models (e.g., renting robots to flexibly absorb seasonal peaks). Fast integration and the ability to up- and downscale these solutions within existing systems are crucial.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To achieve the transition to innovative technologies and processes, it is essential to proactively address cultural resistance and implement effective change management. To drive innovation at every level of the business, leaders must deliver a holistic vision and actively involve employees in the change process. An open communication culture and continuous training of employees help to create a positive environment in which technological innovations are accepted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why do ambitions remain subdued? Many companies are running multiple transformation projects at the same time. Logistics is still often seen as a pure cost center and shifts backwards in priority – although it often delivers quick and measurable effects. The first step to systematically unlocking this potential can be, for example, to develop an innovation roadmap, depending on the business context. This identifies clear areas of action and bottlenecks and links business goals with the appropriate technology choice: not only “Which robot?”, but “What problem, which flow, which bottleneck – and which measure scales across locations?".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our appeal: start now rather than catch up too late. The technologies are up and running, there is a need for action, and market pressure is increasing. Understanding the implementation as a continuous process with a clear roadmap, iterative scaling, and measurable effects closes the gap between ambition and reality – and transforms logistics from an often more reactive element of the value chain into a strategic advantage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="sebastianguetle_2-1765271141464.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350083iD961493E6C77858B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sebastianguetle_2-1765271141464.png" alt="sebastianguetle_2-1765271141464.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure: Vision 2035 and Reality 2025 in Transportation and Logistics&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This article was written in collaboration with Prof. Kai Hoberg (Kühne Logistics University) in the context of the SAP-KLU study "The Supply Chain of the Future”.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;For change history I would suggest looking into the tables&amp;nbsp;CDHDR (Header) and CDPOS (Pos) which logs changes for various document numbers like Material Master Data changes, PO (Requests) and many more.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hello Experts,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am working on SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, and I need to print 7 copies of the same invoice in a single PDF.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I enabled 7 occurrences for the main invoice layout, and now 7 copies are appearing correctly. However, I am facing two issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Item table does not repeat in all 7 copies&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;The header section appears in all 7 copies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;The item table appears only in the first copy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;When I place the item table inside the repeated layout, Adobe Designer shows an error and the form cannot be saved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Because of this issue, I am unable to print the full invoice (header + items + totals) 7 times.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. How to assign labels for each copy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since the backend sends only one invoice, there is no copy number provided.&lt;BR /&gt;I plan to use the repetition index to show:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Copy 1 - Original for Recipient&lt;BR /&gt;Copy 2 - Duplicate for Transporter&lt;BR /&gt;Copy 3 - Triplicate for Supplier&lt;BR /&gt;Copy 4 to 7 - Extra Copy&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But I need guidance on the correct way to implement this in Adobe Form.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;My questions:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is the correct layout structure to repeat the full invoice (header, items, totals) 7 times?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why does the item table cause an error when placed inside the repeated layout?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is the best way to set copy labels using the repetition index?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If anyone has implemented multi-copy invoice printing in S/4HANA Public Cloud with full item data, I would appreciate your guidance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you very much for your question. You should be able to use the CDS view you mentioned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please check whether the following approach (AI-generated) works for you:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;To get the latest planned billing date for a specific WBS element:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Join with WBS Element Information: You'll need to connect this view with WBS element data. Use &lt;CODE&gt;I_CustProjSlsOrdItemWorkPckg which contains the field "WORKPACKAGE" that provides the assigned workpackage of the sales order item in customer project [2].&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Query Structure:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="HenrikeGrtecke_0-1765272427630.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350093i9D6045F275923E59/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="HenrikeGrtecke_0-1765272427630.png" alt="HenrikeGrtecke_0-1765272427630.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/c0c54048d35849128be8e872df5bea6d/7ba56c85d4544dbeb23c23c51e66d820.html?amp%3Bstate=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;amp%3Bversion=2508.500&amp;amp;version=LATEST&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Billing Plan Item of Sales Order Item for Customer Project&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Henrike&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I want to create data-validation rules based on historical data. The master data for each dimension is sourced from different queries, and I prefer &lt;STRONG&gt;not&lt;/STRONG&gt; to create a mapping dimension because it would disrupt the structure of my model.&lt;BR /&gt;The validation rules need to check the historical combinations between &lt;STRONG&gt;Product&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Groups&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Product&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Groups&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Value 2025&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Orange&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;100&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Orange&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;200&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Apple&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;100&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;How can I define validation rules that rely on historical data without creating a mapping dimension?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi Javier, unfortunately RITA is not aligned with Plants Abroad so a foreign plant is not possible in all of the countries where RITA is available. They need to be aligned so it would be good to understand the roadmap.</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In the current SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition (Colombia localization), &lt;EM&gt;withholding tax codes are not exposed in the Configure Value Mapping app&lt;/EM&gt;. The app is designed to handle VAT tax codes for DIAN electronic invoicing. Withholding taxes (RETE‑IVA, RETE‑ICA, ICA, Autorretección, etc.) are managed through the &lt;STRONG&gt;Extended Withholding Tax configuration in CBC&lt;/STRONG&gt; and are not part of the DRC value mapping catalog.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With SuccessFactors EC and EC Payroll, a lot of the burden on Payroll has dissipated, when it comes to having custom Infotypes, dynamic actions and custom operations and functions. Specifically, for any core-HR customisation, the onus is on custom MDFs and portlets in EC; for any time-based custom award interpretation, the onus of driving it is on SF Time Management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, when rostering and timesheeting are part of the larger payroll solution, and the system architecture includes non-SAP applications such as UKG, WFS or others, there is a possibility that some award interpretation may be beyond the capabilities of the leading time system. In such cases, the EC Payroll system has to house the custom logic in some form. SAP’s official position on EC Payroll is for it to only have the Payroll engine running and hence, it is hamstrung when it comes to having a custom ABAP program running for non-payroll logic or even having time evaluation running in ECP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An example of this is below, where the legislation and consequently the Award/CBA/Enterprise Agreement is geared towards automation in the payroll system to pay a percentage of the earnings of an employee on the day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="narayanv1_17-1765156712959.png" style="width: 593px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349443i4EB86FFC818BB5E0/image-dimensions/593x405?v=v2" width="593" height="405" role="button" title="narayanv1_17-1765156712959.png" alt="narayanv1_17-1765156712959.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 1 Example of a Time-based payment legislative guideline&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;EC Payroll gets timesheet data from WFS / UKG / other leading time system which has a record for an employee to get paid this allowance for 1 Unit or say 8 Hours. The payroll schema rolls up all the amounts it needs to pay for the period and at this point, it doesn’t feel the need to carry day-by-day totals of hours or amounts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The timesheet system can’t do this “calculation” outright because it doesn’t know the rate. EC Payroll can’t do this calculation because it doesn’t have day-by-day hours and if the rate is different on different days, then it’s a no-starter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditionally, when EC Payroll needs day-by-day totals, there are 3 options to achieve it:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Time Evaluation (PT60) is run. This needs Infotype 2010 data in time evaluation, which can only be brought into SAP Time Management by a custom operation. There are other overheads such as configuration of time management groupings, time types and collision indicators and a whole time schema to contend with. Payroll administrators are also tasked with the extra responsibility of kicking off PT60 every time they want to run payroll and analyse its errors.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A custom function or operation is written in EC Payroll to fetch and create a structure (similar to ZL) to house day-by-day numbers and amounts. This needs detailed functional specifications, and implementation of robust ABAP code that is able to withstand retros and offcycles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Throw in the towel ☹ and ask the leading time system to send EC Payroll day-by-day totals in a separate set of wage types / pay codes. Although this is the simplest design, it makes life difficult for everyone up and down the payroll value-chain.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Would it be simpler if the RT (Results Table) in EC Payroll could have a day indicator against every wage type line item? How would we achieve it just using standard payroll configuration?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have attempted to do just this in the next few steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Detailed Solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Disclaimer: I have used a German employee and the German payroll schema to illustrate this in SAP’s Learning Hub Payroll demo system due to lack of Australian employees. All employees are fictional.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="narayanv1_18-1765156712963.png" style="width: 598px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349444iDFF14239861525BD/image-dimensions/598x329/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="598" height="329" role="button" title="narayanv1_18-1765156712963.png" alt="narayanv1_18-1765156712963.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 2 Infotype 2010 Data sent from the timesheet system&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please also note that within the above data, I have also added the wage type 2010 which is my custom Leading Hand Allowance wage type which may or may not be sent by the timesheet system.

Since payroll usually deals with pay-period aggregates of wage types, this extra information in the form of a C2 split is real luxury to have which we have now made available to the rest of the schema going forward.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. The second step is to have a placeholder for custom logic to do the day-by-day calculation of hours and/or rate and amount.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="narayanv1_34-1765158519819.png" style="width: 671px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349457i67911B54DF9BA58F/image-dimensions/671x185/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="671" height="185" role="button" title="narayanv1_34-1765158519819.png" alt="narayanv1_34-1765158519819.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 9 Placement of custom PCRs&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is better to write this logic after the amounts are available from Rule X015 so that you have everything you need.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Thirdly, within the rule Z901, I am ensuring that the logic only runs for the wage types which should form part of the daily aggregate.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As you can see below, this rule again seems a bit silly with querying on the C2 Split for each day of the payroll period (31, since it is monthly payroll). It will be much shorter if it is a weekly or fortnightly payroll and you can even identify days of the week based on the day in the payroll period (useful for public holiday and weekend shift counter calculations).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, it is extremely effective in creating an aggregate wage type 9001 with the right C2 split and should just be a one-time activity again.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="narayanv1_26-1765156712978.png" style="width: 515px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349451iEC85FA98C037EA38/image-dimensions/515x594/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="515" height="594" role="button" title="narayanv1_26-1765156712978.png" alt="narayanv1_26-1765156712978.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 10 How Z901 is configured for each day&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;As shown below, the daily aggregates are neatly stacked day-by-day with rates, numbers and amounts.

This method of having a split against the wage type with the day in the payroll period can also drive other applications such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Counting no. of weekend shifts and paying premium&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Paying extra if overtime is on and/or follows a public holiday&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Variable pay rates per day based on timesheet and roster inputs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+SuccessFactors+Employee+Central+Payroll/pd-p/67837800100800006744" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="162-1"&gt;SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/HCM+Payroll/pd-p/372556673030062693282256213775139" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="972-1"&gt;HCM Payroll&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP Public Cloud TM the charge calculation on an Ocean Freight Booking is done for all stages in the transport (which includes the pre-carriage, main-carriage and on-carriage stage), unless specified differently in the stages tab. When creating a Freight Order for Delivery (for the on-carriage stage), there is no charge calculation done on this FO since the costs are already taken into account on the OFB.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My question is: How can I set the charge calculation on the Freight Order for Delivery? I want to create a zero rate or no settlement on the OFB (customer does not expect invoice) and set the transportation costs for the transport from the port to the customer on the FO for Delivery.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Right now, it is not possible to do charge calculation on the Freight Order for Delivery as the charges are already on the OFB:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="tomgk_0-1765204318950.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349804iD3231DDFBEBB7CF9/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="tomgk_0-1765204318950.png" alt="tomgk_0-1765204318950.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any suggestions on how to do this?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Remember, this is in Public Cloud TM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you in advance for your answer.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2254666"&gt;@tvergeer&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, the pro rata year-end adjustment is still calculated for WBS elements that were closed during the year. However, since postings are not allowed directly on closed WBS elements, the correction is booked at the general ledger (G/L) level using adjustment accounts defined in configuration, rather than against the closed WBS itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me explain you how SAP Handles Pro Rata Year-End Adjustments. At year-end, SAP requires recalculating VAT pro rata using the final coefficient determined by tax authorities. This ensures compliance with fiscal rules. Even if a WBS element is closed (status set to "CLSD"), the system still considers its transactions in the calculation of the final pro rata adjustment. Because no postings are permitted on closed WBS elements, SAP does not attempt to reopen them. Instead, adjustments are redirected to G/L accounts&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Let me explain you how the correction is booked.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1.Configuration Setup:&lt;BR /&gt;The key user configures tax codes and adjustment G/L accounts specifically for year-end pro rata corrections. These accounts act as the target for postings when WBS elements are closed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. System Behavior:&lt;BR /&gt;The adjustment job posts correction entries directly to the G/L accounts. The postings are not tied to the WBS element but are instead aggregated at company code level.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Audit Trail:&lt;BR /&gt;The system maintains traceability by linking the adjustment posting to the original transactions, even though the WBS is closed. This ensures compliance without violating the "no postings on closed WBS" rule.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Good day&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2095685"&gt;@SAPuser1996&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, it is not possible to create and use the Firefighter ID/Emergency Access Management in public cloud like you could in on-premise Access Control. The public cloud system provides &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/53e36b5493804bcdb3f6f14de8b487dd/8980ad05330b4585ab96a8e09cef4688.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;business role-based&lt;/A&gt; access but does not contain the classic GRC Firefighter work center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Second, if you want the Firefighter style emergency access process, I suggest you use Cloud Identity Access Governance with the Privileged Access Management&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, Firefighter was replaced with Identity Access Governance (IAG) through Privileged Access Management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Have a look at the following references. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/courses/sap-cloud-identity-access-governance-implementation-and-configuration/preparing-the-setup-of-privileged-access-management-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Preparing the Setup of Privileged Access Management Service&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This Blog provides some good insights: &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/privileged-access-management-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-a-comprehensive-guide/ba-p/13571778" target="_blank"&gt;Privileged Access Management in SAP S/4HANA Cloud: A Comprehensive Guide&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1895613034"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In many SAP projects, sending emails with proper formatting and images is a common requirement—whether it’s for birthday wishes, reminders, approvals, or dashboards. Recently, I faced a real-time scenario where I had to send an email that included an inline image stored in the SAP MIME Repository. Instead of attaching the image as a file, the business wanted it to appear directly inside the email body.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This pushed me to explore how the MIME Repository works and how to embed images using ABAP and the BCS classes. To make the explanation clear and easy to understand, I used AI-assisted content creation while writing this blog—helping me present the technical steps in a simple and readable format.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I will walk you through the complete process of fetching an image from the MIME Repository and sending it in an HTML email using ABAP.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example Code :&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REPORT ZEMAIL_TO_SEND_IMG1.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766496685"&gt;Introduction: Embracing the Future of Digital Learning&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The workplace is changing faster than ever. Artificial intelligence, cloud transformation, and digital innovation are reshaping how work gets done—and creating a widening skills gap that traditional learning programs simply cannot close. Content becomes stale before it's even deployed. Training happens in isolation, disconnected from where employees work. Knowledge retention suffers because learning feels like a checkbox exercise rather than a practical necessity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, we're bringing forward a solution built for this new reality with a transformative shift, transitioning SAP Enable Now to &lt;STRONG&gt;WalkMe Learning Arc&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a modern, AI-native learning platform purpose-built for the dynamic workplace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;WalkMe Learning Arc represents a fundamental reimagining of how organizations deliver training and build lasting proficiency. Rather than relying on outdated, out-of-context learning experiences, it harnesses the power of artificial intelligence, contextual delivery, and behavioural intelligence to ensure employees learn exactly what they need, exactly when they need it—right where they work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This transition isn't just about adopting new software. It's about unlocking a new infrastructure for digital adoption that solves real business challenges: closing skill gaps, accelerating time to proficiency, and building a workforce that can keep pace with change.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569983180"&gt;What This Transition Unlocks: New Possibilities&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1502552394"&gt;Content Authoring Built for Scale&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the biggest challenges facing and other teams today is the sheer volume of content that needs to be created and maintained. Traditional approaches are labour-intensive and slow to adapt as systems and processes evolve.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;WalkMe Learning Arc changes this through &lt;STRONG&gt;AI-first content authoring&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which dramatically accelerates content production and maintenance. Instead of spending weeks building training materials, your team can now create, update, and deploy quality content in a fraction of the time. This solves two critical problems: the capacity constraint that limits how much training you can deliver, and the shelf-life problem that causes content to become outdated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond speed, WalkMe Learning Arc enables &lt;STRONG&gt;multi-modal experiences&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Build once, ship in multiple formats. Whether your learners need full courses, microlearning, quizzes, or interactive guides, you can create a single piece of content and deliver it across multiple channels and media formats—including seamless simulation capture that brings your processes to life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1306038889"&gt;Contextual Delivery in the Flow of Work&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditional learning management systems operate in isolation. Employees complete training in a separate portal, then return to their applications and struggle to apply what they learned. The disconnect is costly: knowledge doesn't transfer, and proficiency takes longer to achieve.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;WalkMe Learning Arc extends training &lt;STRONG&gt;beyond the LMS&lt;/STRONG&gt; and directly into the business applications where work happens. This is the power of contextual learning. When employees need help, they don't have to leave their workflow to search a training portal. Instead, they discover and consume learning content exactly where and when they need it—through in-app search, guided recommendations, and step-by-step support embedded directly in their applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach transforms learning from a separate activity into an integrated part of work itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1109525384"&gt;Continuous Reinforcement That Sticks&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The most powerful learning happens at the moment of need. WalkMe Learning Arc delivers &lt;STRONG&gt;just-in-time learning&lt;/STRONG&gt; by harnessing our Digital Adoption expertise to provide training at the exact moment an employee encounters a task or challenge. This isn't guesswork—it's informed by &lt;STRONG&gt;behavioural intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By analysing how employees actually work, WalkMe Learning Arc uses behaviour-based segmentation and contextualized recommendations to reinforce knowledge precisely when it matters most. This continuous, contextual reinforcement builds lasting proficiency far more effectively than traditional training programs ever could.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-783929160"&gt;The Transition Process: A Smooth, Guided Path&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We've designed the transition from SAP Enable Now to WalkMe Learning Arc to be straightforward and low-risk. Here's what you need to know:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-716498374"&gt;What Gets Transitioned&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your existing SAP Enable Now &lt;STRONG&gt;Digital Learning content &lt;/STRONG&gt;becomes fully usable in the WalkMe environment. This means your content is hostable, playable, and editable—nothing is lost. Selected SAP Enable Now objects can be reused as new WalkMe Learning Arc microlearning objects, giving your content a new life in a modern platform.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note: This transition applies to Digital Learning content only. Digital adoption content from SAP Companion (like guided tours and hot spots) is excluded from this process. You will retain the ability to share digital learning content with learners via an in-app menu experience with WalkMe Learning Arc.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your Customer Success Manager will talk to you about your transition options during the Welcome Call and the transition feature will be turned on if required. This process might differ for selected customers or change in the future. More details for each phase will be available in the Help Documentation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;We will link to a KBA here shortly to make the information about the transition steps more consumable and shorten this blog post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-390902150"&gt;Getting Started: Commercial Options&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We offer flexible commercial transition options to fit your organization's timeline and budget:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In-Quarter Transition: Transition at your contract renewal date for a seamless alignment with your existing agreements.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Out-of-Quarter Transition: Move earlier if you're ready to unlock the benefits sooner. Please note that prerequisites apply.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Test &amp;amp; Go Live: Consider our optional four-month "Test &amp;amp; Go Live" contract, which provides a full productive WalkMe Learning Arc tenant during the transition period. This gives you time to validate the platform and ensure readiness before full cutover.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Connect with your SAP or WalkMe Account Team to plan the commercial transition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-194388645"&gt;Step Into the Future of Learning&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The transition to WalkMe Learning Arc represents more than a platform change—it's a shift toward a learning infrastructure that’s already built for the future. One that closes skill gaps, delivers training in context, and builds lasting proficiency in a workforce that's constantly evolving.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your existing content is safe, your transition path is clear, and the benefits are substantial. The future of learning at work is here. &lt;A href="https://www.walkme.com/digital-learning/?utm_source=web&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_camp%5b%E2%80%A6%5dm_content=enable-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Find out more from our WalkMe Learning Arc website&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ready to get started?&lt;/STRONG&gt; Contact your Account Executive or Account Team to discuss the best transition path for your organization.

    <title>CALL BAPI IN CUSTOM ENTITY THROUGH RAP</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi RAP Developers, Good Day&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In many business scenarios, we need to expose BAPI-based data to SAP Fiori applications without creating database tables or CDS-based persistency. With the RESTful ABAP Programming Model (RAP), this can be achieved efficiently using &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Entities&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which allow us to call ABAP logic directly—such as BAPIs—and return the data as an OData service.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I will walk through how to build a &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Entity that fetches bank details by calling a BAPI&lt;/STRONG&gt;, how to annotate it for UI consumption, and how to expose it seamlessly to a Fiori Elements application. This approach is useful whenever you want to reuse existing BAPIs and business logic while keeping your RAP model clean, lightweight, and high-performing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution Overview:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This solution demonstrates how RAP can seamlessly integrate with classic SAP functionality by exposing BAPI output through a &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Entity&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Instead of relying on database tables or CDS views, the Custom Entity acts as a virtual data source whose data is supplied dynamically via an ABAP class.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When a Fiori Elements UI requests the entity, RAP forwards the query to the ABAP implementation class. This class reads the query parameters (filters, sorting, pagination) and uses them to call &lt;STRONG&gt;BAPI_BANK_GETDETAIL&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The BAPI returns the bank’s address, master data, and related details, which are then transformed into the response structure expected by the Custom Entity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The result is an OData-based, read-only endpoint capable of delivering real-time data from a BAPI with full RAP features such as filtering, sorting, paging, and total count support. This approach makes it easy to modernize existing SAP data retrieval logic while still leveraging stable, proven BAPIs in the backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Entity:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;custom entity not underlying any data source.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;data preview is not possible, becuase this should be implemented in seperate class.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;suitable for paging,calling bapi's and external api's.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@EndUserText.label: 'Custom Entity calling bapi'

Your votes are crucial because they help us prioritize what gets reviewed and potentially added to the backlog. The voting threshold is 8 votes. When voting, please consider which solutions you would like to use productively once available. We’ll keep you updated on the review outcomes in a blog post right within the SAP Advanced Financial Closing session.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When submitting your request, you can choose from the following categories:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Task List Creation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Task Processing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reporting&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configuration and Administration&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cross Topics&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Other&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ready to share your ideas? &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/campaign/4088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Go to the session now&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and start following it to receive updates.

By grouping daily entries and leveraging container-based GUI elements, the approach delivers a clean, scalable, and intuitive navigation experience. It also demonstrates how classic ABAP techniques—selection screens, tree controls, and month/day calculations—can be combined to create interactive UI components that enhance data exploration within SAP GUI.&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;To resolve the activation issue with the Push Distribution Model for Cost Center, follow these steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clean Up MDI Bookkeeping Tables: Ensure that the MDI bookkeeping tables are cleared. This step is crucial for the activation process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Delete Entries in Relevant Tables: In addition to cleaning the bookkeeping tables, delete entries in the database table &lt;STRONG&gt;CSKS_MAP&lt;/STRONG&gt; along with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;MDI_BO_INSTANCE&lt;/STRONG&gt; table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Activate Push Model: After performing the above steps, attempt to activate your Push Distribution Model again.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Replication: Once activated, replicate the data to MDI. Confirmations should be pulled from MDI within 5 minutes, and the replication status should adjust accordingly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach has been successful in resolving similar issues. Please try these steps and let us know if it works for you.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Just curious to know - While deciding on the SAP BDC architecture, when should we use Data Lake storage vs when should we use Object Store?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the BDC Sizing tool, once we add a Datasphere system, we can see that 1TB of Data Lake Storage will require ~560 CU/month. While, same amount of Object Store requires only ~80 CU/month. Refer to the attached screenshots.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is the difference between these 2 storage options and what additional benefit is offered by the Data Lake Storage?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BDC Object Store.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350208i6E8E666570FD3854/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="BDC Object Store.png" alt="BDC Object Store.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BDC Data Lake.png" style="width: 637px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350207i7FAC58B0DF694AC2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="BDC Data Lake.png" alt="BDC Data Lake.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hey Lauryn,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;we faced the same issues with delta replication flows and unfortunately, there is no solution yet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is a customer influence regarding this topic:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/322891/?section=sectionDetails" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Replication Flows - Enable Scheduling for type "Initial and Delta" loads&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As of now, there is no way to enforce delta loading at a specific start date in a specific order (in a task chain for instance).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tano&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Business use Decentralize EWM and have two&amp;nbsp;EWM sloc (0001 main wh, 0002 production wh).&lt;BR /&gt;So now we have stock in both 0001, 0002.&lt;BR /&gt;Now I need a the Production material request to pick the material either from 0001 or from 0002. How to set the master data for this.&lt;BR /&gt;In control cycle for ewm staging its not possible to maintain the different destination and source storage location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="RaghavanKathamuthu_1-1765277763025.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350210iE2886343C547C4AC/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="RaghavanKathamuthu_1-1765277763025.png" alt="RaghavanKathamuthu_1-1765277763025.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Is there any control we can do in /n/SCWM/PSASTAGE to stage material either from 0001 main warehouse or 0002 production warehouse.&lt;BR /&gt;Also on releasing the process order i need the stock to be considered from 0001 main warehouse for ATP. How to achieve this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;cannot able to change the sloc in component other than sloc in PSA assigned in workcenter of operation.&lt;BR /&gt;How business will do the ATP by considering the stock from different sloc.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have found out a conflict between end dates in Calibration and Performance Management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Calibration end date = date 00h00min e.g. 31st Dec 2025 00h00m&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Form end date = date 23h59 min e.g. 31 st Dec 2025 23h59&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This causes issues in People Profile because the sorting order is based on the rating end date :&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0002635378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2635378 - Sorting Order of Background and Trend Data in Employee Profile - SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So the common belief that PM form dates and Calibration dates should match is incorrect because of the design.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To have the correct order in People Profile you have to set the dates as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Form end date =&amp;nbsp;31 st Dec 2025 23h59&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;- Calibration end date = 1st Jan 2026 00h00&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Could SAP SuccessFactors team advise on when they are going to make end dates and times match?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Abdelrani&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Generally its based on attributes or hard coded member values.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You cannot define validation rules based on fact data but what you can do is re classify the input data into right combination using past historical fact records using a Data Action.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please note this will not prevent any wrong combination input but only re process the data into right combination post the Data Action run.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nikhil&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1764623"&gt;@Eduard5&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Question 1.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Public Cloud a parked supplier invoice (document type RE) is not treated like a parked FI journal entry. For RE, SAP parks the MM supplier-invoice document (Invoice Verification object) and does not create the FI expense/G/L line items yet. Because those FI G/L line items don’t exist, they also can’t be stored in / exposed by the FI parked-document structures (VBKPF/VBSEG*) and therefore don’t show up in Manage Journal Entries or in the released I_ParkedOplAcctgDoc* CDS views.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP explicitly describes this as standard behavior and contrasts it with parked G/L journal entries where a full parked FI document is created immediately so yes what you’re seeing is effectively a light accounting representation on the FI side for parked RE invoices until posting, there are no FI expense postings to report (no debit lines, no CO assignments) only the supplier-invoice document data exists on the logistics/AP invoice object side&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Note below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3685396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3685396&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Question 2.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there any CDS view that exposes cost objects for parked RE invoices before posting?&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Not&lt;/STRONG&gt; via FI parked-document CDS views because the FI G/L items do not exist yet &lt;STRONG&gt;BUT&lt;/STRONG&gt; you can get the cost objects from the Supplier Invoice (MM) API / CDS layer, which is where the parked invoice coding is actually stored&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use the released supplier-invoice interface CDS views such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I_SupplierInvoiceAPI01&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I_SuplrInvoiceItemGLAcctAPI01&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Those are the right data sources for parked RE invoice cost assignment before posting&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3273168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3273168&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/cdsviews/I_SUPLRINVOICEITEMGLACCTAPI01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://api.sap.com/cdsviews/I_SUPLRINVOICEITEMGLACCTAPI01&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dawid&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hello Henrike, many thanks for your reply. I think I might have not stated the requirement clearly: The final result needs to be an analytical query, in which the user will get a list of all WBS-Elements with the latest billing date. I'm not sure I can use the mentioned query in that scenario.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;How to Write CDS Table Functions the Standard SAP Way&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, we cannot always express complex business logic using pure CDS syntax. To manage scenarios like long text processing, procedural calculations, or important joins, SAP uses CDS Table Functions implemented through AMDP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While many developers create table functions on the fly, SAP sticks to a strict and consistent design pattern across its standard content. This approach ensures good performance, readability, upgrade safety, and transportability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A useful way to grasp this standard is to look at how SAP builds transactional CDS views, especially those that use CDS Table Functions. By examining SAP-delivered objects like I_SalesOrderTP, we can clearly see the structure, naming conventions, annotations, and implementation method that SAP expects developers to follow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This guide explains how SAP writes table functions, how they implement them using AMDP, and how they use them in CDS views. This will help you design your own extensions in the same way SAP does.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Start with a Standard View: I_SALESORDERTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP provides many standard CDS views in S/4HANA.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To understand how SAP writes table functions, the easiest example is the view: I_SALESORDERTP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This is a Transactional Processing View, delivered by SAP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2025-11-27_19h51_30.png" style="width: 795px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346206i2E91480425C8A436/image-dimensions/795x410/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="795" height="410" role="button" title="2025-11-27_19h51_30.png" alt="2025-11-27_19h51_30.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Locate the Table Function Used Inside the View.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Inside the view, you will notice SAP has used: &lt;STRONG&gt;with parameters (...).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2025-11-27_19h53_17.png" style="width: 808px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346207i528B8200465E6E01/image-dimensions/808x418/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="808" height="418" role="button" title="2025-11-27_19h53_17.png" alt="2025-11-27_19h53_17.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This indicates that the view is consuming &lt;STRONG&gt;a CDS Table Function&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3. You will find the CDS Table Function that SAP has written.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2025-11-27_19h53_23.png" style="width: 822px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346208iA28B1A25D2DA4845/image-dimensions/822x425/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="822" height="425" role="button" title="2025-11-27_19h53_23.png" alt="2025-11-27_19h53_23.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 4.&amp;nbsp; Open the AMDP Class to See SAP’s Logic.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Once you find the Table Function name, open the AMDP class: &lt;STRONG&gt;cl_sd_S4h_stxl_utils=&amp;gt;get_header_text&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Inside this class, SAP has written the entire logic.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2025-11-27_19h53_43.png" style="width: 530px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346209iFF5F548747352D63/image-dimensions/530x479/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="530" height="479" role="button" title="2025-11-27_19h53_43.png" alt="2025-11-27_19h53_43.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When crafting Table Functions ", in the manner SAP does " consistently adhere to this structure:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Create a CDS Table Function with parameters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Implement it via an AMDP class/method using native SQLScript.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consume it in your final CDS view using with parameters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Follow the exact naming, annotation, and structure shown in standard objects such as I_SalesOrderTP, I_PurchaseOrderTP, I_BillingDocumentTP, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Following this pattern guarantees:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best performance (native HANA execution)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transportability and upgrade-safety&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consistency with thousands of standard SAP-delivered objects&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Conclusion&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is a tried-and-true architectural best practice to use SAP's standard pattern for CDS Table Functions. You can align your custom developments with the same design principles used in core SAP objects like *I_SalesOrderTP*, *I_PurchaseOrderTP*, and *I_BillingDocumentTP* by defining a CDS Table Function with parameters, implementing its logic in an AMDP method using native SQLScript, and consuming it through a final CDS view.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This method guarantees that sophisticated logic runs directly on SAP HANA for maximum efficiency, stays neatly isolated from the consumption layer, and is resilient to upgrades and transports. More significantly, because it adheres to a well-known and extensively used standard, it makes your solution instantly comprehensible to other SAP developers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Why would you expect the system to translate the subject that is derived from a long text (especially in the cast of long text) in SOST? SOST is only going to show the email record as it was created, which would be subject to whichever language was used when the email was created, and further it would not be aware of anything that is developed/configured in QM01.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This is not done via Support. I believe you will need to contact your SAP account manager/executive as there is no switch in provisioning to add or remove it directly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;*Please consider marking this answer as solution if your question was properly answered&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

You can then create a filter on configuration group level and save it as a variant. I don't know if you can then create a custom tile that launches the F4579 app with a predefined variant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Please also note that the visibility of each SMBC object in F4579 depends on the authorization. If you don't have permission, you won't be able to see it. This way, you can also ensure that different users can see different configuration objects even though they use the same app.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

I believe this functionality could be applied to the features you’re offering, which would help speed up maintenance and potentially even automate parts of it&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;BR&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi PL1, thanks for your comment. This could probably mean that the recording is accessible to anyone, regardless of their completion? Ideally, only people who completed the item/class can access the document afterwards. Do you have any solutions for this?</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2053253"&gt;@nag_7589&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for your response.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your approach works correctly in ECC and S/4HANA On-Premise, where we can set the “Number of Copies” in the print parameters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, my requirement is for SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, and unfortunately the Public Cloud Output Management framework does not support printing multiple copies using print parameters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In S/4HANA Cloud:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1.Only one print job can be triggered per billing document&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2.The system does not provide a “number of copies” option&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, SAP recommends generating multiple copies inside the Adobe Form itself This is why I am using the repeat-occurrence approach to produce 7 invoice copies in one PDF.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My current challenge is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1.Full invoice (header + items + totals) is not repeating inside the repeated layout&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2.No copy number is provided from backend, so I must control labels using the repetition index inside the form&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So the ECC method unfortunately cannot be applied in S/4HANA Public Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for your input.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For setting up S/4 HANA for Product Compliance one of the critical decision for the business which will decide the Cost(Initial + AMC/Subscription) / ease of maintenance( UI/background Job) and the Content Quality(Latest regulatory content) is choosing the content Provider.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With Product Stewardship Network Deprecated there are 2 options&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;3rd party data provider&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Regulatory Content Service&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ask:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My question is can SAP Regulatory Content Service can be used as standalone for both Process/Discrete Industry whose sole purpose is to run Compliance Check on Substance(Material Compliance) - (And there is no need for running any of the rule /rulesets).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Process to be&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Setup Connection with SAP -&amp;gt;Setup Background Jobs-&amp;gt;Listed Substances Gets Loaded(Updated)-&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; User Creates Regulatory List,includes the Listed Sub and the last part for integration and triggering compliance checks&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on the three points, what would stand out for 3rd party data providers over sap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thank you for a very well written and helpful post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A question, though. From what I understand Basic Authentication is being deprecated with the SuccessFactors 2026 2H release (november '26) - including API users. Is it possible to use OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0. for authentication for Entra's API user?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear All,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've just came across the information that, SAP is about to discontinue the SAP PPM Certification (&lt;SPAN&gt;C_S4PPM_2021) upon ending Dec 2025 as per attached screenshot, and for alternative certification, SAP is recommending the Certification in SAP PS module (C_TS412_2021).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So, my question is, the person who has earned the SAP PPM Certification mentioned above or already scheduled its exam to be passed, what would be his position even if he already hold the Certification of SAP PS&amp;nbsp;(C_TS412_2021).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please guide at your earliest.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Also guide, what will be the future certification recommendation for SAP Consultants who will hold or already have experience in SAP PPM or SAP EPPM?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If there is any other new Certification for SAP PPM or SAP EPPM on SAP S/4 Hana, please guide.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please note that, this person already have some practice based experience (not a live project) for SAP PPM.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="faheem4work_0-1765285333900.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350313iD495B09205B9AB1A/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="faheem4work_0-1765285333900.png" alt="faheem4work_0-1765285333900.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>I want to prevent users from entering data with invalid Product–Groups combinations. Is there a way to enforce this without creating a mapping dimension?</content>

But may be you could create a measure out of it using Dimension to Measure option and then use it in the report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nikhil&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Good day&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1418047"&gt;@Tirukanagouda_K&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The simple answer is, no. However, I will explain the reason below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To summarise, the public cloud does not support cross company settlement when Asset Accounting is involved. Investment WBS, AuC and final asset must be attached to the same company code. This is also confirmed in KBA 3456675. You can find the detail here: &lt;A href="https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3456675" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3456675&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That means, there is no standard option to perform an intercompany settlement between investment WBS elements before or instead of asset transfer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My recommendation is to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Settle the investment project in company code A to AuC and final asset.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use Intercompany Asset Transfer within same country (1IH) to move the asset between your company codes. Below you will find more details on Scope Item 1IH&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/help/979ee481d97045cb8857e3fac1d0073f/84f72ee1fda946dd8667c4a33171ff52.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/help/979ee481d97045cb8857e3fac1d0073f/84f72ee1fda946dd8667c4a33171ff52.html?locale=en-US&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Should you at anytime need earlier intercompany allocation, your usual design separate investment projects in each company code and use intercompany billing or internal charging, while you keep settlement itself strictly intra company.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This Blog provides some very useful insights: &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/settlement-of-investment-projects-in-sap-cloud-erp/ba-p/14158113" target="_blank"&gt;Settlement of Investment Projects in SAP Cloud ERP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
