    <content>&lt;P&gt;For one of the companies in France we are planning to activate RITA and create plants in 3 countries. The documentation mentions that all country specific changes must be finalized before migrating to RITA and no configuration project should remain open during RITA activation. However, it does not specify which changes these are.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1) SAP Help claims:&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(..)Ensure that you have &lt;STRONG&gt;no open transports pertaining to any country/region that you would use as either the company code country/region or the foreign registration country/region.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Complete any transports involving content for any such country/region in any system that you use for testing and in your production system before initiating the migration to RITA. Additionally, if you later activate any additional country/region versions, ensure that all relevant transports are fully complete before performing any RITA-related configuration or maintenance(...)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;2) SNOTE: 2907372 &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(...)RITA activation is possible only if all business configuration projects have been released. Activating RITA with open business configuration projects prevents the subsequent transport of content to your production system. This can cause potentially serious inconsistencies.(...)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Could you point out specifically what changes are considered are country-specific in terms of RITA activation?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What exactly do we mean by the term 'configuration project is released'?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+S%25252F4HANA+Cloud+Public+Edition+Localization/pd-p/326d1e75-a83c-482d-bcf5-f5f6ac1c8d31" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="241-1"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Localization&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+S%25252F4HANA+Cloud+Public+Edition+Finance/pd-p/66233466-fcd6-45d2-a9ae-2cba38c72e19" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="232-1"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Finance&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m currently working on &lt;STRONG&gt;Project Management in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;I successfully created a &lt;STRONG&gt;project with WBS elements&lt;/STRONG&gt; and uploaded the &lt;STRONG&gt;financial planning data&lt;/STRONG&gt; using the app &lt;STRONG&gt;“Import Financial Plan Data.”&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The import was executed successfully, and I can see the &lt;STRONG&gt;budget assigned to each WBS element&lt;/STRONG&gt; correctly in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Plan Data Report&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, when I open the &lt;STRONG&gt;“Monitor Project”&lt;/STRONG&gt; app to check the &lt;STRONG&gt;budget assigned to the project&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the values are &lt;STRONG&gt;not displayed&lt;/STRONG&gt; — it seems that the budget is not visible or not linked to the project in that app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My question:&lt;BR /&gt;Is there any &lt;STRONG&gt;customizing step or configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt; I might have missed to make the imported financial plan visible in the “Monitor Project” app?&lt;BR /&gt;Do I need to perform any &lt;STRONG&gt;activation, version release, or mapping&lt;/STRONG&gt; step between the financial plan and the project structure?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you in advance for your help and insights!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;A slightly late Halloween blog this one, focusing on the haunting themes of RICEFW…&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="RIPRICEF.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335065i2A93C24AE87C1B1B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="RIPRICEF.JPG" alt="RIPRICEF.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Way back in the dawning of current SAP history, when dinosaurs ruled the earth or at least old grey haired SAP consultants had their intros to SAP and the dawning of R/3, there started a concept of RICEF(W) objects. This was then latterly bundled into the ASAP methodology that later partly evolved to the Activate methodology. When I look around today, with what grey hair I have remaining, I still see clear signs across customers in Sweden (where I work) that RICEF is still very much alive and kicking. Then I even notice the term popping up occasionally in marketing and trainings from SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This Halloween I encourage everyone to start the journey to finally put RICEF(W) to rest.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So lets look at what RICEF stood for again:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reports: This originally is a GUI driven ABAP report, and latterly could then also include BW analytical reports, and then any kind of ABAP that could be executed from SA38 (etc).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Interfaces: This started out I think as flat file and IDOC based, and then morphed to include more modern technologies, web-proxies, ODATA and so as a concept is almost current (you could argue). But where does event driven technology fit into this picture I wonder. Is it an enhancement or an interface? (we often have borderline questions like this, and different teams can confusingly chose different answers in a large organization)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Conversions: Data conversions and then transformations&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enhancements: Mods, User Exits, Implicit and then Explicit enhancements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Forms: Sap-Script then Smartforms, then Adobe PDF forms etc. (categorizing by print outputs is really old school!)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And W when used is for Workflows, which you could argue evolved to Build process automation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But what really was RICEF(W)? Well we used it to catalog all of our custom development work in SAP. Back in the 2012s I have a photograph of all of my customers requirements in a large stack of documents, each of which represented a RICEF for our SAP implementation, it was our full RICEF Catalog. RICEF(W) to be fair has tried to morph over the years to fit with modern developments, but I still argue, it is not fit for how we should plan, design and build modern developments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So today I frequently here the question: Should we still use RICEF(W). and my answer today is “Hell NO!”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My reasoning is: RICEF(W) encourages our developers to develop like its 1999, a good thing for Prince fans perhaps, but for modern developers we really need to move on. Clean core is the direction that we must all travel, and to achieve this we need to very much adopt the SAP best practice, and that really does mean removing RICEF(W) and so we must adopt a new direction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Modern development encourages a decoupled component based build, where software components interact and can be plug and play replaced by newer versions, where systems can be freely upgraded without having to investigate all the custom built extensions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So what is the alternative to achieve this?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Well the really good news is that SAP have new methodologies and frameworks, that are here and ready made for the brave new world we find ourselves in. In particular for this question I would point everyone to the SAP Application Extension Methodology.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the old days we would get a requirement, and spend about five minutes before deciding it was to be one (or more) RICEF(W) objects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the new world we throw this approach away and instead we are given a 3 phase cycle (that is open to SAP and 3rd party technologies) to follow. Here I will just describe at a high level, I highly recommend studying the SAP whitepaper here, which is an excellent document, and shows some concrete examples. I would also encourage everyone to try to dry run follow through this document for an extension that they either already have (needs to be a modern extension), or are about to build. This way you fully learn how to use this new methodology.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 3 phases of the methodology&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Assess extension use case: The first being to really understand the use case, and the existing architectural context, and the business context. This means we are following a business first design approach, which then should result in us delivering something that actually meets the business needs (for our context).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Asses extension technology: we assess the extension target solution, taking our use case(s) and defining the actions application logic, system, and required data for the extensions, we then separate this out to extension tasks. The extension tasks are placed in extension styles that are Presentation, Application, Data (Think: Model = Data; View = Presentation; Controller = Application). These extension tasks will be implemented by component building blocks in our solution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Define extension target solution: The third phase then takes these extension building blocks, and defines the extension target solution. This for me as a software engineer is where I start to see light bulbs flashing on. Now we are going to build our extensions in components (not necessarily in SAP), that are placed in one of 3 extension styles, and in the latest whitepaper this then also takes into account clean core classifications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;My current thinking then is that the old RICEFW is now replaced by an Application Extension catalog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The catalog then could be represented as an equation, something like&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;AE01 (Application extension 01) = D01 + D02 (data extension building blocks) + A01 + A03 (Application extension building blocks) + P04 + P06 (presentation layer building blocks).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And we could then also have&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;AE03 = D02 + A03 + A05 + P04 + P07&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An example of a Data extension could be the behavioral definition and implementation for say updating a customer master.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An example of an Application extension would be any necessary business logic implemented in SOLID designed classes&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An example of the Presentation extension would be the Fiori UI or the API that we generate from our projection views and based on our annotations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This means our future solutions now are essentially a lego brick construction comprised of Application extension building blocks. This then gives us the flexibility to build other Application extensions, and reuse some existing blocks again.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We then need to keep a catalog of building block equations to represent all of our Custom Application extensions, and ideally track their clean core scores. We also need to keep track of the testing statuses and versioning of all of these components.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This to me indicates the need for thoughts around how to keep track of status of these new solutions? Possibly some new tooling is needed here (possibly a good first usage of the methodology to design this). The various versioning of the components, and testing statuses in particular, then how to connect these to the business processes and business capabilities for the organization all needs to be managed. Not all these thoughts and questions have answers yet, but I think the journey to our future development work has started, and its time for everyone to get on board.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So this Halloween I encourage everyone developing SAP extensions, to really study the SAP custom extension methodology, and to then say RIP to RICEF(W).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-guidance-framework/sap-application-extension-methodology/sap-application-extension-methodology-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Application Extension Methodology Overview | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/doc/87e18fdb75fd42f8aee59e3c76de7cd7/Cloud/en-US/sap.application.extension.methodology.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;sap.application.extension.methodology.pdf&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Footnote 1: RICEF(W) should only be used to keep track of our legacy solutions that are not built in this new world, that cannot morph to this new world, as quite simply, they are not clean core and not decoupled, and then also not MVC designed and built, and so we should aim to retire these as soon as we can, they represent our legacy design and code debt, our clean core journey is to move away from these so that we can fully leverage the modern solutions that SAP are providing for us.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Footnote 2: Last but not least I would really like to thank &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/16895"&gt;@HrishikeshMangi&lt;/a&gt; who has been the brains behind a lot of joining the dots behind how the application extension methodology is our and hopefully too your way forwards.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Footnote 3: apologies to SAP if in places I may have used slightly the wrong terminology (this often happens in my blogs).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We are currently facing a challenge in our SAP HCM Payroll configuration related to processing salaries for employees working in countries outside Egypt. These employees are assigned to companies that operate in different countries and pay salaries in local currencies (e.g., USD, KES, etc.).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, when we run payroll using the Egypt-specific payroll driver (RPCALCE0), the system automatically converts all salary amounts into the Egyptian Pound (EGP), regardless of the company’s local currency. This behavior does not align with our business requirement, as we need to process and disburse salaries in the respective company currency, not in EGP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We would appreciate your guidance on how to configure the system to support multi-currency payroll processing, ensuring that salaries are calculated and paid in the correct company-specific currency without being converted to EGP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please let us know the recommended approach or any necessary configuration steps to achieve this.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi SauMaris,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently, we can remove a custom logo and revert to the SAP Logo by using the 'Reset' option (refer screenshot below) or by uploading the SAP Logo again.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It's important to note that the 'Reset' option functions as a Reset All, meaning all configurations in Manage Launchpad Settings will be restored to their default settings. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We are working on a better solution for future releases. Stay tuned!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Aparna&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Aparna_N_0-1762095767263.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335068i1322D565C76D8CEC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Aparna_N_0-1762095767263.png" alt="Aparna_N_0-1762095767263.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1634762752"&gt;Driving Efficiency and Innovation.&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;In Formula 1, every millisecond counts — and behind every lap of precision lies a world of data, integration, and intelligent technology. The same principles drive the partnership between SAP and PETRONAS, extending far beyond the racetrack.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In its 50th anniversary year, &lt;STRONG&gt;PETRONAS&lt;/STRONG&gt; – the dynamic global energy group and long-time partner of the &lt;STRONG&gt;Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team&lt;/STRONG&gt; – continues to accelerate its digital transformation journey. One of the most significant milestones in this process has been its strategic partnership with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, through the adoption of &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Concur&lt;/STRONG&gt; for travel and expense management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For years, PETRONAS relied on SAP’s traditional &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Concur/pd-p/3f613a69-f511-450e-82d3-943b2bb8ff50" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="204-1"&gt;SAP Concur&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Travel &amp;amp; Expense (TVM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; solution. However, as the platform reached its end of life, the company faced a familiar challenge: excessive customization costs and increasing complexity. This was the perfect moment to rethink processes and shift towards a more integrated and intelligent approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1696414685"&gt;A Seamless Move to SAP Concur&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transitioning to &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Concur/pd-p/3f613a69-f511-450e-82d3-943b2bb8ff50" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="204-2"&gt;SAP Concur&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was not just a system migration – it was a business transformation. The move allowed PETRONAS to align travel and expense operations with the broader&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP ecosystem, which already serves as the organization's digital backbone&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With SAP Concur, employees now benefit from &lt;STRONG&gt;end-to-end visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;, covering every step from &lt;STRONG&gt;travel request to expense reporting&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The system brings &lt;STRONG&gt;cost transparency&lt;/STRONG&gt;, allowing users to clearly see flight, accommodation, and meal allowance options in real time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since its full rollout in 2022, PETRONAS has reported a &lt;STRONG&gt;20% improvement in travel cost efficiency&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This measurable gain highlights how digital integration can directly contribute to financial discipline and operational excellence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1499901180"&gt;Beyond Efficiency: Building the Future Together&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;But this partnership is not just about cost savings. PETRONAS and SAP are working together to &lt;STRONG&gt;co-innovate and future-proof&lt;/STRONG&gt; business processes. The next frontier involves leveraging &lt;STRONG&gt;AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;, particularly generative AI,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;to minimize manual intervention and automate monitoring&lt;/SPAN&gt;, freeing finance teams to focus on strategic value creation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As PETRONAS continues to push the limits of technology both on and off the racetrack, the collaboration with SAP reflects a shared mindset: &lt;STRONG&gt;continuous innovation, transparency, and performance&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Just as precision and data drive the Formula 1 team’s success, the same principles now power PETRONAS’ financial operations — ensuring that every digital pit stop contributes to a faster, smarter, and more sustainable future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1303387675"&gt;The São Paulo Grand Prix: Innovation Meets Performance in Brazil&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This weekend, attention turns to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Formula 1 MSC Cruises Grande Prémio de São Paulo&lt;/STRONG&gt;, taking place at the iconic Autódromo José Carlos Pace (Interlagos) in Brazil. The event showcases not only speed and competition, but the spirit of innovation and performance that also underpins PETRONAS and SAP’s collaboration. (&lt;A class="" href="https://f1saopaulo.com.br/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_new" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;f1saopaulo.com.br&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From high-octane racing to high-impact business transformation, the connection is clear: whether on the track or in the boardroom, excellence and technology go hand in hand.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From racetrack to boardroom, &lt;STRONG&gt;innovation is a team sport&lt;/STRONG&gt;. SAP and PETRONAS demonstrate how technology and vision can drive performance at every level — turning data into decisions, and processes into progress.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Today, technology creates champions.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;And as the largest European technology company, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP empowers winners in sports, in business, and in your organization.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Concur/pd-p/3f613a69-f511-450e-82d3-943b2bb8ff50" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="204-3"&gt;SAP Concur&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. The "Global Maxima" Strategy: Why the "App + Data + AI" Flywheel is the Core Bet&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP's core strategic argument stays consistent - that "&lt;EM&gt;a seamless app, data, and AI flywheel creates the highest value&lt;/EM&gt;". This model, where all three components are part of a single, integrated suite, was positioned as the only way to win in the new age of AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;This was a direct declaration that the integrated suite is superior to a "best-of-breed" approach.&amp;nbsp;Muhammad argued that AI with the "broadest context" (drawn from a full suite) will always provide the "deepest value".&amp;nbsp;He explicitly stated that standalone players focusing on just one or two domains "will then, by definition, struggle to create enterprise-wide value with AI".&amp;nbsp;For SAP, this "out-of-the-box harmonized data model" is no longer just a nice-to-have; it's the essential foundation for achieving "global maxima" and avoiding the integration tax and "opportunity cost" of a fragmented landscape.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="1. SAP's &amp;quot;App + Data + AI&amp;quot; Flywheel Concept" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335069iC6F6DEAFE19E0E7D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="1. SAP's _App + Data + AI_ Flywheel Concept.png" alt="1.

SAP's "App + Data + AI" Flywheel Concept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Joule, Agents, and AI Assistants: The New Operating Model&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP is operationalizing its AI strategy through a new hierarchy:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The single conversational "Gen UI" that acts as the engagement layer.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agents:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The specialized "tools" that perform specific tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI Assistants:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Role-specific partners, such as a "Receivable Assistant," "Controlling Assistant," or "Sourcing Assistant", which have these agents at their disposal.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is the "how" behind the "what."&amp;nbsp;Stefan's end-to-end demo showed&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;as the single interface to drive insights and actions across the entire business suite, from procurement-to-pay to order-to-cash.&amp;nbsp;Priyanka's demo took this a step further, showing an "operations&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;assistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;" for a plant manager, which then orchestrated multiple&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;agents&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(like the "asset health agent," "maintenance planner agent," and "procurement assistant") to resolve a complex machine breakdown. This signals a fundamental redesign of the user experience, moving from clicking through apps to orchestrating complex, cross-functional outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2. Joule, Agents, and AI Assistants_The New Operating Model" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335070iB0FAE4BF5AE1F748/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2.

Joule, Agents, and AI Assistants_The New Operating Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. The 5 Patterns of AI: A New Framework for Business Applications&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The keynote introduced a five-pattern framework to explain how AI will "fundamentally reinvent business applications".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This conceptual framework is a crucial guide for business leaders planning their AI roadmaps. It shows a multi-pronged innovation strategy, acknowledging that different processes will be transformed in different ways.&amp;nbsp;The five patterns are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Seamlessly embedded AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and agentic experiences.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agent-driven autonomous execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;capabilities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Truly AI-native applications&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;built from the ground up.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;App-less experiences&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;driven by a conversational layer.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No-apps experiences&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;where the app is generated in real-time.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="3. The 5 Patterns of AI_A New Framework for Business Applications" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335071iFB637BE4C0053124/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="3.

The 5 Patterns of AI_A New Framework for Business Applications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. From Insight-to-Action... to Autonomous Execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP is aggressively pushing beyond simple AI recommendations toward "agent-driven autonomous execution".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is the end-game.&amp;nbsp;The keynote stressed that this evolution will happen as "your colleague has built enough trust on the assistant's performance".&amp;nbsp;Priyanka's demo of an "autonomous maintenance and repair operation" was the flagship example.&amp;nbsp;The vision is for the system to autonomously handle an entire complex event - from detecting a machine failure to identifying orders at risk, ordering the spare part from a supplier, and dispatching the best technician,... with the human partner simply monitoring and approving, not executing the workflow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="4. From Insight to Action to Autonomous Execution" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335072iC35A9280878B13DC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="4. From Insight to Action to Autonomous Execution.png" alt="4. From Insight to Action to Autonomous Execution" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;4. From Insight to Action to Autonomous Execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. "Deep Research": Joule's New High-Value Skill&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;A powerful new capability in Joule called "deep research" was introduced and demoed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is where SAP expects to unlock "100x type use cases for value".&amp;nbsp;Instead of just answering simple, transactional queries, "deep research" allows Joule to synthesize "vast amounts of internal and external data" to answer complex, strategic questions.&amp;nbsp;The example of compressing a 6-8 week account planning process into "just a few hours" - by synthesizing history, surfacing drivers, comparing playbooks, and drafting a plan - is a tangible game-changer for any go-to-market organization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="5. Deep Research in Joule" style="width: 892px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335073i36197C49E00312DF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5. Deep Research in Joule.png" alt="5. Deep Research in Joule" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;5. Deep Research in Joule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Truly AI-Native Applications Arrive (Supply Chain &amp;amp; Ariba)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP unveiled its first "truly AI-native applications", making good on the promise of its 5-pattern framework.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This proves the framework isn't just theory.&amp;nbsp;The new&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supply Chain Orchestration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;solution was the prime example, described as a "GPS for your supply chain" that uses a "network knowledge graph" to analyze real-time signals, assess risk, and suggest alternatives.&amp;nbsp;The major&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Ariba source-to-pay suite update&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;was also positioned as "AI-native", enabling an "agentic and autonomous" approach to procurement.&amp;nbsp;For existing customers, the most important line was the promise that this Ariba update will be "a non-disruptive update... that will not require a re-implementation"&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="6. Supply Chain Orchestration" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335074i10327D75AECE8CFF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="6. Supply Chain Orchestration.png" alt="6. Supply Chain Orchestration" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;6. Supply Chain Orchestration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. "Skills are the New Supply Chain"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The "Future of Work" segment, featuring Chief People Officer of SAP, Gina Vargiu-Breuer and futurist Ian Beecraft, reframed the entire human-AI partnership around the concept of "skills".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This segment's most memorable line was Gina's: "&lt;EM&gt;skills are the new supply chain&lt;/EM&gt;".&amp;nbsp;With the shelf-life of technical skills plummeting to 18-36 months, the focus must shift from static "jobs" to a dynamic "skills-first" approach.&amp;nbsp;AI is positioned as the enabler, allowing employees to "stretch into adjacent territories and skills" - for example, a financial planner using AI to perform predictive analytics without needing a data science degree.&amp;nbsp;This makes a strong case for SAP SuccessFactors as the critical platform for managing this new, fast-moving "supply chain" of talent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Business Data Cloud Gets Smarter with "Intelligent Applications"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP is expanding its Business Data Cloud offering with a new suite of "intelligent applications".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is the "Data" layer of the flywheel in action.&amp;nbsp;The new apps:&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance Intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supply Chain Intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Revenue Intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consumer Products Intelligence &lt;/STRONG&gt;...&amp;nbsp;are designed to sit on top of the harmonized data layer and provide the "broadest context" the AI flywheel needs. This move elevates the Business Data Cloud from a purely technical "data fabric" into a tangible value-delivery platform, providing the out-of-the-box insights that fuel the AI assistants.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="8. Business Data Cloud Gets Smarter with Intelligent Applications" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335075i524EC783F33DBD22/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="8.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Team,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I want to display the measure name with the selected variable/prompt value in SAC story table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ex: Story has a measure 'Amt' and a variable/prompt for Year. When user runs report by entering '2023' in the Year variable/prompt. The measure name should be displayed as 'Amt 2023'.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I know there is a work around, by placing a text box on the measure column name and enabling dynamic text.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But it wont work in my case as number of measure column might increase based on filters applied by user. Because i am using dimensions in the column. So when users filters dimension members the number of measure columns increase.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you look at the below image, 'Meas' is the measure and&amp;nbsp; 'App' and 'Types' are dimensions in the column of the table. As per the image 'S1' is selected/filtered for 'App' dimension and 'T1' is&amp;nbsp;selected/filtered for 'Types' dimension. Hence table shows only one column 'Col1'. The issue is the number of columns increase when user select/filter more values for 'App' and 'Types' dimensions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="deshmukh_0-1762099468719.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335085iF86794BF0B41F8FE/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="deshmukh_0-1762099468719.png" alt="deshmukh_0-1762099468719.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So to summarize I cant use Dynamic text work around in this case as the number of columns is not static. It changes with the user selection/filters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The story is based on Datasphere Analytical Model (live).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please let me know how to achieve this either in SAC or in the Datasphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;deshmukhk&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/843599"&gt;@govardhan_vegi98&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":waving_hand:"&gt;👋&lt;/span&gt; The issue is likely that your event handler is tied to the table’s general onSelect event — which fires for any cell click, not just the WBS column. Try adding a condition inside your script to check the selected column ID before showing the message.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Is there any way to implement preload with variant management on &lt;STRONG&gt;Filterbar (oData v4)&lt;/STRONG&gt; custom filter fields Multi Input filter? im currently facing this issue, we have a page with custom filter fields, but im not able to retrieve the value, just using Value implementation mentioned here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/468a97775123488ab3345a0c48cadd8f/5fb9f57fcf12401bbe39a635e9a32a4e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/468a97775123488ab3345a0c48cadd8f/5fb9f57fcf12401bbe39a635e9a32a4e.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;we have samples for:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Range (primitive),&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Value (primitive), Multi Input (token) * we do not have native preload&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;i need a example for sap.fe.macros.filter.type.MultiValue to use with sap.m.MultiInput with value help (to load variant value by native)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;i tried to implement preload but fiori keeps preventing this by keeping dirty states, so im opening this topic to see is there any cleaner way to do that&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":blue_book:"&gt;📘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; Guide Complet : Configurer un Flux d'Approbation Flexible pour le Bon de Commande (SAP S/4HANA Cloud)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ce guide est conçu pour tous les types d'utilisateurs, des utilisateurs finaux ("Dummies") aux consultants et utilisateurs clés. Nous allons transformer une procédure technique &amp;nbsp;en un processus métier complet de bout en bout, incluant les concepts, la configuration détaillée, et un plan de test pratique.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ce guide est basé sur la version &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2308&lt;/STRONG&gt;1.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":light_bulb:"&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; Concepts : Qu'est-ce que le Workflow Flexible ? (Pour les "Nuls" et Utilisateurs Finaux)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Avant de configurer, comprenons-le "pourquoi" et le "comment".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Qu'est-ce que c'est ?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Le &lt;STRONG&gt;Workflow Flexible&lt;/STRONG&gt; est la méthode moderne de SAP S/4HANA pour gérer les processus d'approbation. Voyez-le comme un "robot" de routage intelligent pour vos documents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Avant (L'ancienne méthode) :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Les règles d'approbation (stratégies de lancement) étaient rigides, complexes et nécessitaient souvent un expert technique (un développeur) pour être modifiées.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Maintenant (Le Workflow Flexible) :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Les règles sont définies par les utilisateurs clés (Key Users) directement dans une application Fiori. C'est visuel, adaptable et ne nécessite aucun code.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pourquoi l'utiliser ?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Flexibilité :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Vous pouvez changer les règles (ex: "Approbation requise si &amp;gt; 1000 EUR" au lieu de 500 EUR) en quelques clics.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mobilité :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Les approbateurs reçoivent les tâches dans leur application &lt;STRONG&gt;My Inbox&lt;/STRONG&gt; et peuvent approuver depuis leur ordinateur ou leur téléphone.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Traçabilité :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Vous voyez exactement qui doit approuver, qui a approuvé, et à quelle heure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Le Processus de Bout en Bout (Exemple simple)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Création :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Un acheteur crée une commande d'achat (PO) de 600 EUR.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Déclenchement :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Le système vérifie les règles. Il voit que 600 EUR est supérieur à la limite de 500 EUR que nous avons définie.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Approbation :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Le système bloque la PO et envoie automatiquement une tâche d'approbation au manager (ex: dans l'application &lt;STRONG&gt;My Inbox&lt;/STRONG&gt;).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Action :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Le manager ouvre la tâche, vérifie la PO, et clique sur "Approuver".&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Libération :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Le système libère automatiquement la PO. Elle est maintenant officielle et peut être envoyée au fournisseur.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":hammer_and_wrench:"&gt;🛠&lt;/span&gt;️&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; Guide de Configuration (Pour les Utilisateurs Clés et Consultants)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cette section détaille le "comment" construire le processus, en suivant précisément la procédure de vos documents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prérequis&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Vous devez être connecté avec le rôle : &lt;STRONG&gt;Configuration Expert - Business Process Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;3.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Le workflow flexible doit déjà être activé pour le type de document d'achat (ex: NB) dans votre système. C'est une étape de configuration de base (scoping).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Procédure de Configuration (Étape par Étape)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nous allons maintenant configurer une règle qui exige une approbation pour toute commande d'achat du groupe d'acheteurs 003 dont la valeur dépasse 500 EUR.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accéder à l'application&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Connectez-vous à la barre de lancement SAP Fiori.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ouvrez l'application &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Workflows for Purchase Orders&lt;/STRONG&gt; (F2872).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;L'écran Manage Workflows s'affiche, listant tous les workflows existants7.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Créer le Nouveau Workflow&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cliquez sur &lt;STRONG&gt;Ajouter&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Add) pour créer un nouveau workflow.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Dans l'onglet En-tête (Header), saisissez un nom clair.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Nom du workflow :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Test du workflow pour le bon de commande CEB.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Définir les Conditions de Lancement (Le "Quand")&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Allez à la section &lt;STRONG&gt;Conditions de démarrage&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Start Conditions).

Could you please confirm if this redefinition of SEGW based ODATA service works in Public Cloud as well? Or it is possible only in Private Cloud?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Quick travel tip for anyone heading over by public transport: the U2 isn’t reaching Alexanderplatz directly at the moment – you’ll need to hop on a replacement bus along the way. Berlin likes to keep things interesting!&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’d rather avoid the scenic detour, the S-Bahn is your best bet.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear customer,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are two options:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Release the mentioned transport. (You will have to do this sooner or later anyway.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Disable the message. It must be ensured that the tax code/tax rate changes are stored in a transport without any other objects to avoid any dependencies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If there are any concerns about option 1, please proceed with option 2.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Redefinition does not work in public cloud. Because there is no access with sapgui and only programming model supported is RAP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I&amp;nbsp; private cloud it would work as it does in on premise systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind Regards,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Andre&lt;/P&gt;</content>

For SAP users, it is important to understand how the reform affects logistical and financial processes, be aware of implementation deadlines, and know what solutions SAP provides to ensure a smooth transition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implementation Timeline of the Tax Reform&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2026&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The tax reform begins to be tested, with initial lower rates of 0.9% for the Contribution on Goods and Services (CBS) and 0.1% for the Tax on Goods and Services (IBS).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2027&lt;/STRONG&gt;: CBS comes into effect, replacing PIS and Cofins. The IPI rate will be zeroed, except for industrialized products in the ZFM.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2028&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Last year of ICMS and ISS without changes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2029&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Gradual elimination of ICMS and ISS, with an annual reduction of 10% in their rates, as part of the replacement by IBS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2033&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Full adoption of the new tax regime, with the extinction of ICMS and ISS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Deliverables&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;SAP is committed to supporting its clients during the transition to the new tax model. SAP solutions are being updated to meet the new legal requirements, ensuring that companies can adapt to the changes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SNOTE: Note Analyzer tool&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;We strongly recommend using the Note Analyzer tool to organize the implementation of SAP Notes for this solution. Refer to &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3200109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3200109&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;for instructions on this tool and use the XML file attached to &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3561376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3561376&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; to list the SAP deliverables for Brazil's Tax Reform. The latest version of Note Analyzer introduces a feature that displays the implementation order in the "comments" column after importing the XML. Follow this order, even if some SAP Notes are not relevant to your business. Note that the tool provides the correct order but not a complete list of prerequisites for the SAP Notes. Therefore, additional analysis may be necessary to address potential dependencies.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Important observations during the implementation of SAP notes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For each SAP Note to be implemented, take a moment to read its textual content. This way, you can become informed about known prerequisite notes, manual steps to be executed before or after the automatic implementation of correction instructions, and be aware of other instructions. Reading the content of each note to be implemented can help avoid implementation issues and the need for rework.&lt;BR /&gt;Moreover, it is crucial not to proceed with the implementation of subsequent SAP Notes, leaving previous notes incorrectly implemented in the system (status: incompletely implemented), as this leads to a corrupted system and the absence of necessary contexts and objects for future implementations. Therefore, when implementing a list of SAP Notes, ensure that each note is implemented correctly and completely.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Support Resources&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;SAP provides several support resources, including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Work Zone - &lt;A href="https://workzone.one.int.sap/site#workzone-home&amp;amp;/groups/megyHY2RfCOoFFjTRtuG42/workpage_tabs/roMCO8ihM8R2uuisht4ZEI" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Brazil - Tax Reform Localization&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: It allows SAP customers and partners to share information and collaborate on matters related to the Tax Reform.

have the SAP solutions related to the tax reform fully implemented and tested by &lt;STRONG&gt;December 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt; to ensure compliance with the new obligations starting from January 2026.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Government Validation&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Currently, it is possible to test document approval with the fields for the new taxes in SEFAZ's homologation environment, and optionally, to send them in production as well. SEFAZ's production environment will begin validating the new XML fields of NF-e related to the tax reform taxes starting in January 2026. Until that date, filling out these new fields is optional and, even if filled, should not cause rejection in NF-e approval.&lt;BR /&gt;From January 2026, filling out the fields for the new taxes will be mandatory, with legal significance, for electronic tax documents in the production environment. Non-compliance may lead to the rejection of the invoices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The tax reform in Brazil represents a significant legal change, so be mindful of the deadline for compliance.&lt;BR /&gt;The SAP informational notes listed above and the troubleshooting KBA will be continuously updated to ensure you have access to relevant information as you update your system.&lt;BR /&gt;Utilize the available resources and engage in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://workzone.one.int.sap/site#workzone-home&amp;amp;/groups/megyHY2RfCOoFFjTRtuG42/workpage_tabs/roMCO8ihM8R2uuisht4ZEI" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Work Zone&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; to clarify any doubts.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

For instance, a dedicated SAP Convergent Charging (CC) server for development, another for testing, and one for UAT or production. While such setups ensure isolation and compliance, they also introduce significant operational and cost overhead. Each server requires its own installation, maintenance, and upgrade cycle, resulting in higher total cost of ownership (TCO) and increased administrative complexity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For SaaS providers managing multiple B2B customers or internal business units, this challenge amplifies maintaining several SAP CC servers becomes both operationally inefficient and commercially unsustainable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the SAP CC 2025 FPS0 release, this long-standing challenge is now resolved through the introduction of Multi-Client Support. Customers can now host multiple logical clients (such as development, testing or UAT) on a single SAP CC server, fully aligned with the client concept in SAP S/4HANA. Each client operates as a completely isolated box, with its own business and technical data thus ensuring data segregation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this feature you can not only reduces infrastructure and licensing costs but also simplifies upgrades and maintenance, making it a major step forward in enabling cost-efficient scalability and streamlined operations for SAP CC customers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 1: Multiclient support for SAP Convergent Charging" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335104i773213F9F680F92D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide3.PNG" alt="Figure 1: Multiclient support for SAP Convergent Charging" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 1: Multiclient support for SAP Convergent Charging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Benefits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Massive cost efficiency, simplified upgrades and lifecycle management, consistent governance, and seamless alignment with S/4HANA multi-client strategies, empowering organizations to scale smarter, not heavier.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;For easier implementation from Cockpit&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;New Fiori app, &lt;EM&gt;Manage Clients, &lt;/EM&gt;available in the SAP CC Cockpit that enables &lt;EM&gt;System Administrators &lt;/EM&gt;to export and import clients, their related JCo destinations (used for the communication between an SAP CC system and an SAP S/4HANA system) and customer management areas.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information about this new feature, refer to &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/Convergent_Charging/a432b344476a4421abe0629f8f162721/be75f2b6d8d54160a8f970640beeea8a.html?state=latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Multiclient Management in SAP CC (New)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; topic on the SAP Help Portal. And refer to the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3636174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Note 3636174&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - One SAP Convergent Charging system connected to multiple S/4HANA systems for implementation guidelines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1438250054"&gt;Re-rating for contracts using shared allowances within a sharing group&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine a global travel platform such as REX Corporation, offering a Flight Booking-as-a-Service platform to airlines and travel partners. Through this platform, multiple partner agencies or airline business units share a common monthly allowance of booking transactions or API calls under a sharing group. Now imagine that, in such a complex shared allowance setup, after the billing cycle has closed, REX Corporation discovers that a portion of booking transactions was incorrectly rated into the next month’s billing period. Since the usage allowance is shared across multiple contracts, this results in imbalanced consumption reporting, revenue leakage, and potential audit risks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Until now, in SAP BRIM we supported end-to-end shared allowance management, however, support of automated re-rating for these shared allowances were not possible. As a result, such re-rating requests often had to be handled manually, thus increasing complexity and introducing a high risk of human error.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the SAP CC 2025 FPS0 release, this limitation is now resolved. Businesses can now trigger a complete re-rating for all contracts within a sharing group that consume shared allowances, directly from Convergent Invoicing (CI). The system automatically re-rates the entire sharing group together, ensuring synchronized allowance recalculation, accurate billing adjustments, and audit-safe financial compliance, without any custom intervention.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 2: Re-rating for contracts using shared allowances within a sharing group" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335105i06FA4FDAC189B7D9/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide4.PNG" alt="Figure 2: Re-rating for contracts using shared allowances within a sharing group" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 2: Re-rating for contracts using shared allowances within a sharing group&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Improve support for B2B use cases using account split and/or shared allowances&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To support this feature end-to-end, we have introduced enhancements across SOM, CC, and CI.

Now you don’t need to manual keyword searches or navigate through multiple SAP help pages, rather, get all your queries answered in a conversational way from the Joule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This capability can be implemented through the new Joule plugin integrated into the SAP CC Cockpit, onboarding the conversational search experience seamlessly inside the product UI. It significantly accelerates onboarding, learning, and day-to-day operations for business and IT users. Please note: this feature is available exclusively in SAP Convergent Charging, private cloud edition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 3: SAP CC Conversational search" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335106i736736A3CD2B16E1/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide5.PNG" alt="Figure 3: SAP CC Conversational search" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 3: SAP CC Conversational search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Improve user satisfaction through the ability to express business requirements in natural language&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enable quicker access to user-enablement content summarized in a crisp answer&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Save valuable time by avoiding browsing through a long search-result list and reading into several topics to find the correct information&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information about this new scope item, refer to &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3617641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Note 3617641 - Integrating Joule with SAP Convergent Charging for Conversational Search&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1045223044"&gt;Other Enhancements&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition to the features mentioned above, SAP Convergent Charging 2025 FPS00 also introduces other enhancements:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-977792258"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhancements of Web services for integration with SAP CPQ&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To further improve integration with SAP CPQ, SAP CC now offers enhanced web services to support consumption-based usage charging directly during quote creation and management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this enhancement, CPQ can dynamically create range tables when a new quote is generated and also modify existing range tables during quote adjustments, enabling sales teams to configure complex usage-based pricing models with greater accuracy and flexibility. This significantly improves sales agility with more quotation process, pricing precision, and end-to-end automation for subscription and usage-driven business models.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Improve the integration capabilities between SAP CPQ and SAP Convergent Charging&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find more detail about this feature from SAP Help portal: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/doc/d847860d561a47568a936d5f3cbeb9da/2025.0/en-US/core_wsdoc/catalogManagement/processcomponent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Catalog Management&lt;/A&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/doc/d847860d561a47568a936d5f3cbeb9da/2025.0/en-US/core_wsdoc/catalogManagement/RangeTableDataCSVImport.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Import Range Table Data from CSV&lt;/A&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/doc/d847860d561a47568a936d5f3cbeb9da/2025.0/en-US/core_wsdoc/catalogManagement/MappingTableDataCSVImport.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Import Mapping Table Data from CSV&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781278753"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Replacement of Core Tool functionalities&amp;nbsp;by functionalities in Cockpit Fiori apps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As part of SAP CC’s strategic shift toward a modern, unified user experience, we are gradually transitioning key Core Tool functionalities into Cockpit Fiori apps. With the 2025 release of SAP Convergent Charging, this phased replacement has officially begun. As previously communicated in our April 2025 SAP Blog, the transition will be executed role by role, ensuring 100% functional coverage of the existing Core Tool. You can find the detailed announcement in the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/financial-management-blog-posts-by-sap/replacement-of-core-tool-functionalities-by-functionalities-in-cockpit/ba-p/14070731" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Blog page&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the first phase of this journey, the User Administrator role is now fully migrated and will exclusively use the Fiori-based "&lt;EM&gt;Manage User Accounts&lt;/EM&gt;" and "&lt;EM&gt;Manage Permissions&lt;/EM&gt;" apps within the Cockpit. This evolution not only aligns with SAP’s Fiori-first UX strategy, but also delivers a more intuitive, consistent, and future-ready user experience across the SAP BRIM suite.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The User Administrator role will use the dedicated Fiori apps available in the Cockpit:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage User Accounts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Permissions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find more details, refer to the SAP Note &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3589935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;3589935 - Replacement of user account management functionalities in Core Tool by functionalities in Cockpit Fiori apps as of SAP Convergent Charging 2025&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-455682529"&gt;More Information&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Convergent Charging 2025 FPS00 has been released to customers on October 15th, 2025, &amp;nbsp;and is available on the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/software-downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Software Download Center&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information on SAP Convergent Charging 2025 FPS 00, check out the following links:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/Convergent_Charging/a432b344476a4421abe0629f8f162721/4d32b905c79a44e88a1a5421b2c0a420.html?version=2025.0&amp;amp;state=latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What’s New in 2025 FPS00&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3568737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Release Information Note (RIN) for SAP Convergent Charging 2025&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/BRIM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Product Page on SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/Convergent_Charging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;à Convergent Charging&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Business AI in BRIM: &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/capabilities-guide/billing-and-revenue-innovation-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Help Page&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/doc/f5e24770dcc74fa698801dd6f50eb415/1.0/en-US/6ac29017bc1244e3bff5c9cc16c0dab0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Initial Setup of Joule for BRIM&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://answers.sap.com/tags/01200314690800001318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Questions and Answers for SAP Convergent Charging in SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP BRIM Customer Influence Portal &amp;gt; Opportunity area “&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Solution Quotation and BRIM&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;</content>

Later, when you receive the actual invoice from the broker, you can reconcile and adjust the difference under the relevant &lt;STRONG&gt;expense account&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Colleagues,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I need some help because looking at the control costs we keep our heads scratching. Maybe there is something we overlooked.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The case is as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We have posted 5 Activities on a production Cost Centre. Some of the credit came from confirmation (like MFBF), some from KB21N.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;There are number of Cost Elements posted on this CC.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;One Activity doesn’t have corresponding Cost Element posted in this period.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All Activites and Cost Elements are included in a OKES assignment. There is no loose cannon.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All Cost Elements posted are linked to an assignment, there is no activity independent cost on this CC.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Cost Centre is assigned to the Splitting Structure in OKEW.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;There are Cost Elements which are assigned to multiple OKES assignments but on this Cost Centre, all Cost Elements posted is assigned to only one assignment. So, we have a 1:1 model.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;1 Activity Types’s actual price will be calculated based on activity quantity, the rest based on capacity. (act. prices indicator is 5 and 6, respectively).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No Activity quantity nor Costs planned for this Cost Centre nor we have scheduled activity only Capacity is planned.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Actual Price calculation method is set to Periodic in OKEQ.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;After running KSS2, we have a mysterious amount of 27.625 which was assigned to the activity which didn’t have corresponding actual costs, then added again to ACT01, and ACT04 got this amount as Control Cost. Doesn’t make sense AT ALL.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any hint will be warmly welcomed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cheers&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;M.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MarcinWaskiewicz_0-1762110621992.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335107iEBEED08A00D2794E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MarcinWaskiewicz_0-1762110621992.png" alt="MarcinWaskiewicz_0-1762110621992.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Once SAP BTP has been established as platform for side-by-side extensions to your SAP solutions, it becomes important to keep an overview of the deployed extensions. Earlier this year, I blogged about the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/manage-sap-build-projects-as-part-of-your-enterprise-architecture/ba-p/14126712" target="_blank"&gt;discovery of SAP Build projects&lt;/A&gt; to push them into the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/leanix/ea/sap-landscape-discovery-inbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP discovery inbox&lt;/A&gt; of SAP LeanIX. Now I am excited to share with you that we &lt;A href="https://updates.leanix.net/announcements/discover-extensions-running-in-your-sap-btp-cloud-foundry-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;just released&lt;/A&gt; the next step in our discovery journey: The discovery of applications deployed to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. This includes their service bindings, the used Cloud Foundry buildpack versions, and a grouping if multi target applications (MTA) were deployed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1634763619"&gt;What you gain&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;For you as enterprise architect, this means you can easily get an overview of all the deployed applications across the whole SAP BTP global account. If your company has more than one global account in place, the integration can be setup several times and all discoveries will be sent to LeanIX’ “SAP discover inbox”. After adding applications relevant for your productive landscape to your inventory, you can easily browse through the deployed apps without the need of access to the SAP BTP subaccounts. Following the SAP LeanIX modeling guidelines, applications are related to platform fact sheets which represent the global- and subaccounts. Furthermore, service bindings to SAP BTP services are modeled as IT Components.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on customer feedback, the SAP discovery inbox will suggest an IT Component based on the used Cloud Foundry buildpack version.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Imagine that with one click, you can see which Cloud Foundry deployments across your SAP BTP landscape are using an outdated buildpack version!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1438250114"&gt;This is what you need&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The setup is described in &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/leanix/ea/configuring-sap-btp-cloud-foundry-integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;, but I want to point out the headlines here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What you need is a platform user in your tenant of the SAP Cloud Identity Service, for which the generation and authentication with certificates is enabled. Trust between the IAS tenant and the SAP BTP global- and subaccounts needs to be established.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Your development teams need to add this platform user to all respective Cloud Foundry organizations and spaces which should be crawled. We recommend adding this user to the spaces which include your productively used applications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;With this platform user, its certificate &amp;amp; related password, the list of used Cloud Foundry API Servers, and a service key to SAP Cloud Management Service, you are good to go. SAP LeanIX will start fetching all deployments, service bindings, and buildpacks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="MyHANAApp _MTA__relations_explorer.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335116iCB81F54B72BF10A1/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MyHANAApp _MTA__relations_explorer.png" alt="MyHANAApp _MTA__relations_explorer.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1241736609"&gt;Feedback is welcome!&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Try it out and let me know your feedback! The &lt;A href="https://roadmap.leanix.net/c/663-sap-discovery-discover-context-to-self-built-software-deployed-to-sap-btp-cloud-foundry-runtime?&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;roadmap item&lt;/A&gt; includes a link for finding a joint time to talk.

Best practice is to simply: Create a communication arrangement (which you have already done), generate an OAuth token, POST a JSON payload to /A_SalesOrder, Map external fields to standard S4H fields, optionally use SAP Cloud Integration or Groovy scripts for dynamic field mapping.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach is fully clean core complaint, secure, and scalable for automation. For testing, Postman + OAuth token is sufficient. For Production, integrate through SAP BTP/CPI for dynamic payload handling and monitoring.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let me know if you have further questions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

SAP restricts this to maintain the clean core. Instead, you should consider using:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Manage Production Orders (A2X API) to update standard header fields externally, or&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The BD_MFGORDER_MODIFY_CUST_FIELDS BAdI to populate custom fields internally.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Whilst you cannot modify the standard order header directly, there are clean-core-compliant workarounds such as using Process Automation you may consider. You can use SAP Build Process Automation or SAP Cloud ALM process automation to:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Detect the order release event (via Event Mesh/Business Event ManufacturingOrder.Release).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Use BTP integration flow (iFlow) or REST API call to the “Manage Production Orders (A2X API_MFG_ORDER) service.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Update the order’s batch field using the API, this API supports PATCH operations in header data.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let me know if you have further questions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Olá pessoal!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Se você trabalha com SAP aqui em Minas, se liga:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Montei um panorama composto por &lt;STRONG&gt;60 empresas de Belo Horizonte e Região Metropolitana&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;que usam SAP — e o resultado mostra que &lt;STRONG&gt;BH é um polo forte do país&lt;/STRONG&gt; quando o assunto é transformação digital com SAP. A lista de empresas estará no final do post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Observação&amp;nbsp; bem importante: a lista de empresas não foi gerada por IA. Foi um levantamento feito por pessoas reais. No caso o Ulisses Pereira me passou essa lista. A IA ajudou&amp;nbsp; a analisar os dados estatísticos para obter insights.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;O post é longo, então se acomode na cadeira e se prepare para engajar no final.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Martin,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Does the new SAP SuccessFactors to Active Directory (Enterprise App) address the issue where embedded SAC reporting from SAP SuccessFactors only works if SF is the importing data source to IAS? This was the reason that in my head, only SF can be the importing user source for employees... (advised to me by SF experts and I pushed hard to use EntraId as the importing source).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To be transparent, I just noted the architecture picture and haven't read through what seems like an excellent guiding blog post (just making a note of it for when I do need it)...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cheers,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Matt&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;BR /&gt;I’d like to discuss key security considerations for SAP marketplace apps — especially for those built on SAP BTP and published on the SAP Store.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For developers working in this space:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What are the most common security pitfalls you’ve faced (e.g., authentication, tenant isolation, data protection)?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Which tools or frameworks do you use for secure app development (XSUAA, OAuth, IAS, etc.)?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How do you handle compliance with SAP certification and GDPR standards?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Any real-world lessons or tips from app reviews or production issues?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s share best practices to help developers build secure, trusted SAP marketplace apps.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;了解您的云系统状态和即将发生的事件是当前企业设置中的一个必要条件。SAP通过推出SAP云可用性应用，确保您能够及时掌握云解决方案的情况。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="VivianCheng_0-1762146877519.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335122i16FE0444FA9E2023/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="VivianCheng_0-1762146877519.png" alt="VivianCheng_0-1762146877519.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;您可能会想，我该如何访问这个功能呢？让我来为您介绍这个过程。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP for Me&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;中的&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;云可用性&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP云可用性应用是SAP for Me的一部分，而SAP for Me当前是SAP支持的主要入口点。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;要访问该平台，您需要一个S用户ID，这是一种在SAP客户和合作伙伴账户下颁发的标识符，用于访问我们的主要支持平台，比如&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;如果您对S用户不熟悉，我们建议查阅这篇详细的博客文章：&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/crm-and-cx-blog-posts-by-sap/learn-how-to-get-an-s-user-id/ba-p/13899351" target="_blank"&gt;了解如何获得S-user ID&lt;/A&gt;。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;接下来，我们来看看如何找到SAP云可用性：&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;使用您的S-user ID和密码登录me.sap.com。&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;在主页中，点击左侧边栏的“&lt;STRONG&gt;系统与供应&lt;/STRONG&gt;”仪表板。&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;前往“&lt;STRONG&gt;可用性&lt;/STRONG&gt;”标签，或在概览标签中找到“&lt;STRONG&gt;可用性状态&lt;/STRONG&gt;”卡片。&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="VivianCheng_1-1762146877524.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img

/&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;通过&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/userscontacts" target="_blank" rel="noopener

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since its different sub-accounts, the XSUAA instance will be different and the job scheduler of one subaccount cannot authenticate the app in other account.&amp;nbsp;XSUAA instances are isolated per subaccount.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For B to A calls, you need a technical client in A (with the right scopes), and B’s Job/Service must authenticate using that.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Marian,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Just trying to use this in practice and discovered the strange binding it uses when calling the action handler:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MattHarding_0-1762150973582.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335140i9D075F246C24050A/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MattHarding_0-1762150973582.png" alt="MattHarding_0-1762150973582.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So because of the bind directly to the extensionAPI - you lose context to your object. e.g.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MattHarding_1-1762149164236.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335136iC3A9CA98BD9502FE/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MattHarding_1-1762149164236.png" alt="MattHarding_1-1762149164236.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(should say unavailable like this)&lt;BR /&gt;Not actually sure how to re-establish "this" to use other methods or const's in this file...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;Just something small for you to see what opinion you have on this in case you are bored on the way to TechEd&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cheers,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Matt&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763847237"&gt;Why Choose SAP Business One Over Traditional ERP for SMEs?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Article Teaser:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Small and mid-sized businesses often struggle with large ERP systems built for big corporations. SAP Business One offers a leaner, smarter alternative designed specifically for SMEs. But what makes it stand out? Let’s explore the differences and why it often wins.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1696416451"&gt;A Simple View: Traditional ERP vs SAP Business One&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditional ERPs are powerful but they come with high cost, long setup time, and heavy processes. For many SMEs, this means delays and overhead.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business One is built for smaller operations. It connects finance, sales, inventory and operations in one system. It supports on-premise or cloud deployment. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1499902946"&gt;Key Advantages for SMEs&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Speed and Cost-Efficiency:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP Business One uses fewer resources to deploy and maintain. SMEs can start faster and without heavy budgets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Built-In Modules for Core Functions:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Finance, CRM, inventory, production and reporting all in one system. This reduces silos and errors.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Real-Time Insights and Reporting:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Leaders make decisions quickly based on live data, not just past reports.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scalability and Flexibility:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Though built for SMEs, the system grows with you adding users or modules as needed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1303389441"&gt;When Traditional ERP Still Makes Sense&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;If your business is very large, highly global, or has ultra-complex processes, a full enterprise ERP might still be the right choice. But for most SMEs needing speed, clarity and cost control, SAP Business One hits the balance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1106875936"&gt;Practical Example&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine an SME with multiple warehouses, global sales, and service calls. With SAP Business One you get:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Visible inventory across locations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sales orders are linked directly to stock and deliveries.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Finance sees profit by product, region, or season in a few clicks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Compliance and audits are easier because data is in one system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of juggling spreadsheets and multiple tools, everything lives in one system made for your size.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-910362431"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;For SMEs seeking a business system that delivers strength without the overhead of full enterprise ERP, SAP Business One offers a compelling option. It connects core functions, gives live data to decision-makers, scales with growth, and keeps costs in check.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Context :&lt;/STRONG&gt; We use &lt;STRONG&gt;Power Automate Desktop (PAD)&lt;/STRONG&gt; to automate &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP ECC via SAP GUI Scripting&lt;/STRONG&gt; for report export and &lt;STRONG&gt;MB21&lt;/STRONG&gt; posting (GUI only; no API/connector).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Our understanding:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Because access is &lt;STRONG&gt;via SAP GUI (direct)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the bot should be licensed as a &lt;STRONG&gt;standard SAP Named User&lt;/STRONG&gt; (BOT account), &lt;STRONG&gt;not&lt;/STRONG&gt; as an SAP “RPA user” and &lt;STRONG&gt;not&lt;/STRONG&gt; under &lt;STRONG&gt;Digital/Indirect Access&lt;/STRONG&gt; (that would apply if we used non-SAP front-ends/API creating the 9 Digital Access document types).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Microsoft licensing is separate: &lt;STRONG&gt;cloud scheduling/unattended&lt;/STRONG&gt; would require &lt;STRONG&gt;Power Automate Premium&lt;/STRONG&gt;. (Today we’re &lt;STRONG&gt;attended/manual&lt;/STRONG&gt;.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Questions to confirm (please answer Yes/No):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;For PAD via &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP GUI&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;is a special SAP RPA license required?&lt;/STRONG&gt; Or is a &lt;STRONG&gt;standard Named User&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the BOT account sufficient under our contract?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Which Named User class&lt;/STRONG&gt; should we assign to the BOT (Professional vs Limited), given it creates &lt;STRONG&gt;MB21 reservations&lt;/STRONG&gt;?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Can we proceed to create a &lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated BOT account&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Dialog or Service) with &lt;STRONG&gt;least-privilege&lt;/STRONG&gt; roles and restrict &lt;STRONG&gt;GUI Scripting&lt;/STRONG&gt; (S_SCR) to this BOT only?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;If in the future we switch to &lt;STRONG&gt;API/connector&lt;/STRONG&gt; flows, should we then evaluate &lt;STRONG&gt;Digital Access&lt;/STRONG&gt; (document-based) separately?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If this looks right, we’ll proceed with a BOT Named User and keep runs &lt;STRONG&gt;attended&lt;/STRONG&gt; until any Premium licensing is approved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Richard&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The way we build SAP applications is changing fast. With &lt;STRONG&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; servers, we can now give our AI-assisted tools the context they need to work &lt;I&gt;with&lt;/I&gt; our SAP stack — not just around it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In simple terms, &lt;STRONG&gt;MCP servers&lt;/STRONG&gt; act as &lt;I&gt;tool connectors&lt;/I&gt; for AI agents, editors, or developer assistants. Instead of generating generic code, your assistant becomes aware of SAP-specific frameworks like &lt;STRONG&gt;UI5&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;CAP (CDS)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;Fiori Tools&lt;/STRONG&gt; — helping you scaffold, lint, and maintain projects with accuracy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1892929988"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Are MCP Servers?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of an MCP server as a “knowledge bridge” between your AI tool (like a code assistant) and your SAP development environment.&lt;BR /&gt;Each server provides domain-specific capabilities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;UI5 MCP Server&lt;/STRONG&gt; – for scaffolding, linting, and guiding UI5/Fiori app development.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CDS MCP Server&lt;/STRONG&gt; – for CAP projects, offering CDS modeling, service generation, and best-practice checks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fiori MCP Server&lt;/STRONG&gt; – for managing Fiori elements, annotations, and page templates.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Together, these servers create a unified developer experience — where AI understands SAP architecture and frameworks natively.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567333764"&gt;Understanding the Core Components of MCP&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; is built around three main components that work together to connect AI systems with useful tools and data sources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Server&lt;/STRONG&gt; – provides tools, resources, and prompts&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Client&lt;/STRONG&gt; – acts as the bridge between the LLM and the MCP Server&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Host&lt;/STRONG&gt; – the environment or application that brings it all together (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code extensions)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s explore how these parts interact to power intelligent, context-aware development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1499902978"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;MCP Server – The Tool and Data Provider&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Server&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the heart of the ecosystem.&lt;BR /&gt;It’s a program that exposes capabilities the AI (LLM) can use — such as tools, resources, or prompt templates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An MCP Server can provide:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tools&lt;/STRONG&gt; – executable functions (for example, fetching data from a database or scaffolding a project)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resources&lt;/STRONG&gt; – reusable files or datasets frequently accessed by AI&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prompts&lt;/STRONG&gt; – pre-defined, high-quality prompts for interacting with other AI services&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unlike a traditional API server, the MCP Server can run &lt;STRONG&gt;locally&lt;/STRONG&gt; on your machine or be deployed &lt;STRONG&gt;remotely&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the cloud.&lt;BR /&gt;When the LLM identifies a need for a specific function, it calls the corresponding tool from the MCP Server, retrieves the data, and uses it to complete the user’s request.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sahil2508_2-1762148530026.png" style="width: 703px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335132i86FBE0BDE890E48F/image-dimensions/703x232/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="703" height="232" role="button" title="Sahil2508_2-1762148530026.png" alt="Sahil2508_2-1762148530026.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1303389473"&gt;MCP Client – The Communication Bridge&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Client&lt;/STRONG&gt; connects the LLM to one or more MCP Servers.&lt;BR /&gt;It handles all message routing between them, ensuring smooth and structured communication.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Its main responsibilities are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Receiving requests from the LLM&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Forwarding them to the relevant MCP Server&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Returning the server’s output back to the LLM&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of it as the “messenger” that makes sure the AI can talk to the right tools without needing to know the technical details of how those tools work.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sahil2508_5-1762148684608.png" style="width: 617px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335134i8607C0179FEE7A80/image-dimensions/617x219/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="617" height="219" role="button" title="Sahil2508_5-1762148684608.png" alt="Sahil2508_5-1762148684608.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1106875968"&gt;MCP Host – The User’s Interaction Layer&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Host&lt;/STRONG&gt; is any environment or application that integrates both an LLM and an MCP Client.&lt;BR /&gt;Popular examples include &lt;STRONG&gt;Claude Desktop&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Cursor&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;VS Code extensions&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These hosts provide the user interface — what you actually interact with — while the MCP Client quietly connects to one or more MCP Servers behind the scenes.&lt;BR /&gt;This setup lets you extend an AI model’s abilities with domain-specific tools, all within your familiar development environment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sahil2508_4-1762148644387.png" style="width: 474px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335133i62DBC2F9193E70A7/image-dimensions/474x352/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="474" height="352" role="button" title="Sahil2508_4-1762148644387.png" alt="Sahil2508_4-1762148644387.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-910362463"&gt;MCP Workflow&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The three roles mentioned above ultimately form an AI application built on MCP.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sahil2508_1-1762148407993.png" style="width: 900px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335131iC23F0972C6027F5B/image-dimensions/900x216/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="900" height="216" role="button" title="Sahil2508_1-1762148407993.png" alt="Sahil2508_1-1762148407993.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-713848958"&gt;Quick Setup&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can install any of these servers globally or within your project.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;All are available on npm under the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/163398"&gt;@cap&lt;/a&gt;-js&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;

Successfully created a SAPUI5 TypeScript application inside
../CloudStorage/OneDrive-SAPSE/Documents/MCP/app/recruitment.management.yesno
(Namespace: recruitment.management.yesno
Framework: SAPUI5 1.141.1) and npm install was executed.
Note that the BaseController has no onInit function, so do not try to call super.onInit() in the MainController when adding code.
Note that in CAP projects you MUST NOT use npm start of this UI5 app, as doing this and opening it on port 8080 will not allow the app to load any data. Instead, you MUST use cds watch in the project root to start the server. The new app is then automatically served at /recruitment.management.yesno/index.html.
Note that the table in the Main view has no columns and the Form has no fields, as an OData service and entity was provided, but no properties were specified and none could be found automatically.

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1634736770"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The previous two episodes have demonstrated how to create and register a custom mass processing function code in COHV as well as have provided an outline of the actual implementation of the mass processing. However, the implementation has not done anything useful, yet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, it is the time to add some meat to the implementation and dive into more advanced topics like test mode, function parametrization and order updates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1438223265"&gt;Test mode&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let us start with test mode. Typically, SAP standard mass processing functions provide a test mode option that runs all data processing without actually saving any changes or updates. That is particularly useful if you want to test a mass processing run without committing the updates.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1 Test mode on" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334752i6C2E18FFE74EA10B/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Dominik_Tylczynski_0-1761917035115.png" alt="Figure 1 Test mode on" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 1 Test mode on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 2 Test mode off" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334753iDEEAF86769372C91/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Dominik_Tylczynski_1-1761917078022.png" alt="Figure 2 Test mode off" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 2 Test mode off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The implementation of the mass processing function does not need to explicitly handle test mode operation, i.e. either to rollback or commit changes. That is done by COHV backbone. Make sure to test thoroughly if the test mode is used to make sure that the custom mass processing function is compatible with the test mode handling in COHV. If you are not sure, the rule of thumb is not to use the test mode.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1241709760"&gt;Passing parameters to the mass processing function&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mass processing functions can be supplied with additional parameters. That is often used in SAP standard functions, and it can be enabled for custom ones.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, additional parameters need to be added to the transparent table and the dialog structure that have been created in the episode 2.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear SAP Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When it comes to the design of web-based user interfaces, SAP truly has a rich history. A great example is the &lt;EM&gt;EPM Purchase Order Demo&lt;/EM&gt; (FPM/WDA application &lt;STRONG&gt;S_EPM_FPM_PO&lt;/STRONG&gt;) (see Figure 1):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 1: Application S_EPM_FPM_PO – Design evolution over the years" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335142iA01B5776787FD00F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure1.png" alt="Figure 1: Application S_EPM_FPM_PO – Design evolution over the years" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 1: Application S_EPM_FPM_PO – Design evolution over the years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Design themes such as &lt;EM&gt;Tradeshow&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Corbusier&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Belize&lt;/EM&gt;, or &lt;EM&gt;Quartz&lt;/EM&gt; are well known to many developers. But the journey doesn’t end there — it continues toward new &lt;EM&gt;Horizon&lt;/EM&gt;s and compliance with the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;WCAG 2.2&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;Accessibility Standard&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the latest releases, several new features have been added to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Floorplan Manager (FPM) / Web Dynpro ABAP&lt;/STRONG&gt; framework, driven by customer feedback, SAP design standards, and general product evolution. With the &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Platform 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt; (on-premise, private cloud, and public cloud editions), we are delivering several enhancements that can be activated easily — either automatically through delivery or manually with minimal configuration or coding effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Page Header UIBBs &amp;amp; Object Page Mode&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In one of my previous blogs on S/4HANA 2023, &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/team-fpm-how-to-render-an-fpm-overview-page-to-look-like-a-sap-fiori-object/ba-p/13574743" target="_blank"&gt;Team FPM: How to Render an FPM Overview Page to Look Like a SAP Fiori Object Page&lt;/A&gt;, I introduced the Object Page Mode for the Overview Page (OVP) floorplan.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This mode allows you to render an FPM Overview Page application like a &lt;STRONG&gt;Fiori Object Page&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Combined with a &lt;STRONG&gt;Page Header UIBB&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you get a &lt;STRONG&gt;dynamic object header&lt;/STRONG&gt; that automatically expands and collapses while scrolling. You can also &lt;EM&gt;pin&lt;/EM&gt; the header to keep it fixed. You can easily try this out in the &lt;EM&gt;Search Page&lt;/EM&gt; of the EPM Purchase Order Demo (see Figure 2).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 2: S_EPM_FPM_PO with Page Header, Pin and List Item Navigation" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335143i87D84893C71BCF8A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure2.png" alt="Figure 2: S_EPM_FPM_PO with Page Header, Pin and List Item Navigation" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 2: S_EPM_FPM_PO with Page Header, Pin and List Item Navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new &lt;STRONG&gt;List-Item Navigation&lt;/STRONG&gt; lets users navigate to a Purchase Order’s detail page in a Fiori-compliant way. On the detail page, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Object Page Mode&lt;/STRONG&gt; provides faster and more precise scrolling to specific screen areas (sections or UIBBs) using the &lt;EM&gt;Anchor Bar&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;Navigation Bar &lt;/EM&gt;(see Figure 4).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 3: Purchase Order Detail Page with Anchor Bar" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335144i0B8F795EE5D792BA/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure3.png" alt="Figure 3: Purchase Order Detail Page with Anchor Bar" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 3: Purchase Order Detail Page with Anchor Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configuration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Object Page Mode&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; is activated in the &lt;EM&gt;General Settings&lt;/EM&gt; as a &lt;STRONG&gt;Floorplan Mode&lt;/STRONG&gt; (see Figure 4).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To use a dynamic object header, define a &lt;STRONG&gt;Page Header Area&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the layout and add &lt;STRONG&gt;Page Header UIBBs&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 4: Object Page Mode setting in FLUID for OVP Floorplan S_EPM_UX_PO_OVP" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335145iB85A0E571BC94D7C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure4.png" alt="Figure 4: Object Page Mode setting in FLUID for OVP Floorplan S_EPM_UX_PO_OVP" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 4: Object Page Mode setting in FLUID for OVP Floorplan S_EPM_UX_PO_OVP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the &lt;STRONG&gt;List&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;Tree UIBB&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a &lt;EM&gt;List-Item Navigation&lt;/EM&gt; corresponds to rendering a &lt;EM&gt;Link-To-Action&lt;/EM&gt; column differently. You can achieve this by checking &lt;STRONG&gt;Render as Navigation Column&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the column configuration (see Figure 5).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 5: Setting “Purchase Order ID” as Navigation Column in FLUID for List UIBB EPM_PO_OVP_SEARCH_LIST_CFG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335146i7160278118045024/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure5.png" alt="Figure 5: Setting “Purchase Order ID” as Navigation Column in FLUID for List UIBB EPM_PO_OVP_SEARCH_LIST_CFG" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 5: Setting “Purchase Order ID” as Navigation Column in FLUID for List UIBB EPM_PO_OVP_SEARCH_LIST_CFG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Additional Remarks&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Some OVP floorplan features may behave differently in Object Page Mode. This can affect:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Header rendering&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UIBB Selector and Page Master splitter control&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Section and UIBB stacking&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Personalization and panel behavior&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;However, &lt;STRONG&gt;Power User Modes&lt;/STRONG&gt; allow overriding some restrictions — such as enabling drag-and-drop for UIBBs, expanding and collapsing panels, or rearranging layout elements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSS Grid Layout &amp;amp; WCAG 2.2 Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Another major improvement is the &lt;STRONG&gt;WCAG 2.2-compliant rendering of forms&lt;/STRONG&gt;. We’ve significantly enhanced the responsiveness of the &lt;STRONG&gt;Form/Repeater UIBB (GL2)&lt;/STRONG&gt; by adopting a &lt;STRONG&gt;CSS Grid Layout&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This ensures that forms remain usable and readable — even at screen widths as low as &lt;STRONG&gt;320px&lt;/STRONG&gt; (mobile phone format) — without horizontal scrolling (see Figure 6).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 6: “Purchase Order Details” form in different screen sizes" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335147iB90178B963411AE4/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure6.png" alt="Figure 6: “Purchase Order Details” form in different screen sizes" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 6: “Purchase Order Details” form in different screen sizes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the configuration editor (&lt;STRONG&gt;FLUID&lt;/STRONG&gt;), you can enable the CSS Grid layout &lt;/SPAN&gt;at&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; General Settings → Layout Design Type → Responsive &lt;/STRONG&gt;(see Figure 7).&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 7: FLUID configuration for Form UIBB EPM_PO_OVP_HEADER_FORM_CFG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335148iD8CAAF582D5152A3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure7.png" alt="Figure 7: FLUID configuration for Form UIBB EPM_PO_OVP_HEADER_FORM_CFG" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 7: FLUID configuration for Form UIBB EPM_PO_OVP_HEADER_FORM_CFG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Toasts &amp;amp; Invisible Alerts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this context, it’s worth mentioning the &lt;STRONG&gt;Message Toast &lt;/STRONG&gt;and &lt;STRONG&gt;Invisible Alert&lt;/STRONG&gt; features, which enhance both usability and accessibility. A &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/design-system/fiori-design-web/ui-elements/message-toast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Message Toast&lt;/A&gt; is a small, non-disruptive popup for success messages that disappears automatically after a few seconds (see Figure 8). The &amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;IF_FPM_MESSAGE_MANAGER&lt;/STRONG&gt; ABAP interface now provides the REPORT_MESSAGE_TOAST method for this purpose. You can also enable a Toast Mode globally with the SET_TOAST_MODE( IV_TOAST_MODE = GC_TOAST_MODE-ENABLED ) method, &amp;nbsp;ensuring that messages of severity Success (S) are displayed as toasts by default (see also &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/9c91640bf34c49d8bad6bc560bedd707/f3e1e20e241147dc8b6cba3b9a7154e7.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=202510.000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 8: “Data Saved” Toast in S_EPM_FPM_PO" style="width: 685px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335149i1347DF5DAABE648C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure8.png" alt="Figure 8: “Data Saved” Toast in S_EPM_FPM_PO" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 8: “Data Saved” Toast in S_EPM_FPM_PO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An &lt;STRONG&gt;Invisible Alert&lt;/STRONG&gt;, on the other hand, is used to inform &lt;EM&gt;screen reader users&lt;/EM&gt; about content changes that are visible but not triggered by them — ensuring WCAG 2.2 compliance. Use the REPORT_INVISIBLE_ALERT method from the &lt;STRONG&gt;IF_FPM_MESSAGE_MANAGER&lt;/STRONG&gt; interface for this purpose.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":back_arrow:"&gt;🔙&lt;/span&gt;FLP Back Navigation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, let us introduce Back Navigation in the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori Launchpad&lt;/STRONG&gt; (FLP).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can now configure where the FLP back button should navigate to. By default, it goes back to the &lt;STRONG&gt;previous application&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but often it’s more useful to return to the &lt;STRONG&gt;previous page within the same application&lt;/STRONG&gt;. For example, when navigating from a main page to an edit page, you likely want the back button to return to the main page of the same object. Further details are available in &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/9c91640bf34c49d8bad6bc560bedd707/92c804cee1254ba7bee9c85d6b0b8f3f.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=202510.000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Summary&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With SAP S/4HANA 2025, the Floorplan Manager for Web Dynpro ABAP continues its evolution toward:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A &lt;STRONG&gt;Fiori-consistent Object Page experience&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Improved a&lt;STRONG&gt;ccessibility (WCAG 2.2)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;More r&lt;STRONG&gt;esponsive layouts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enhanced u&lt;STRONG&gt;ser feedback mechanisms&lt;/STRONG&gt; (message toasts, invisible alerts)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Smarter n&lt;STRONG&gt;avigation handling&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the Fiori Launchpad&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These innovations make it easier than ever for FPM-based applications to deliver a modern, accessible, and consistent user experience — across all S/4HANA deployment options.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for reading — and see you next time! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If your employees are assigned to company codes that are located outside Egypt, then you need to install the appropriate localization for these companies countries. The basis consultant can add the required packages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you can't find the required localization, then the only option is to use International version (PC00_M99_CALC).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, the multi-currency payroll isn't standard option in SAP payroll due to financial and legal compliance.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi, I've been trying to test the API_PROJECT_V3 to get some User Status from my WBS Element in SAP PS. Using the GET method, I've tried to get other details like WBSElementStatus or WBSElement but I didn't find any reference to extract User Status in the API documentation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Just want to ask if there is a way or workaround for this to retrieve the UserStatus using the API_PROJECT_V3&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1829"&gt;@zfiori&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, can you be more specific, my point was to discuss a little bit introduction to MCP, the findings of how I set it up and sample commands that I ran on my workspace describing the way how MCP interpreted my Natural language command into Input for the mcp giving project reference and the output it generated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To mention the images to explain MCP of the blog is taken from&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://dh.xg.int.sap/#/hero/missions/199076" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://dh.xg.int.sap/#/hero/missions/199076&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;(which I should have mentioned), but I couldn't find anything wrong with the text which I have used.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thanks &amp;amp; Regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Sahil&lt;/P&gt;</content>
