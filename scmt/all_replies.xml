    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thanks to Moshe&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;First of all, a heartfelt thank you to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/29"&gt;@moshenaveh&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, who initiated this wonderful blog series about hobbies in the SAP Community. His post “Mind your step” about walking and hiking not only inspired me, but also showed me how closely movement, nature, and inner peace are connected. Hiking and running have also been passions of mine for many years. But one special experience led me onto a new path: the path of yoga. Today I combine both movement in nature and on the yoga mat, combined with mindfulness, conscious breathing, and inner clarity.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Me on a mindful hike near Austria wearing a hat." style="width: 749px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317109i86F3435EB121DF84/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="P1070657.JPG" alt="Me on a mindful hike near Austria wearing a hat." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Me on a mindful hike near Austria wearing a hat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1631815274"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Who I am&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My name is Achim Toeper, and I have been part of the SAP world for more than three decades. My professional journey has taken me deep into technology and leadership – but at the same time I discovered another passion: yoga and mindfulness. Since completing my yoga teacher training in 2018, these practices have become an integral part of my life. They give me energy, inspiration, and a new way of engaging with people in projects, teams, and communities. From this connection, personal projects where born, in which I combine movement, mindfulness, and leadership skills, like writing and talking about it.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;My path to yoga&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some years ago, I found myself in an extremely intense professional period, marked by great responsibility and pressure. The stress kept growing – and I realized that I needed a counterbalance to avoid burning out. In this search, I came across yoga for the first time in a wellness hotel in the Allgäu – at exactly the moment when I needed it the most. This experience truly flashed me: I immediately felt that yoga is more than just movement. During those very days, I knew I wanted to dive deeper and one day become a yoga teacher myself. Step by step I learned how to regain strength through conscious breathing, movement, and meditation. Yoga gave me not only calm and balance, but also a new perspective on leadership, collaboration, and on myself.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Yoga class and ice bathing in the Ore Mountains 2014" style="width: 664px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317111iE5257BA1C4C9C656/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PHOTO-2025-09-17-10-16-06.jpg" alt="Yoga class and ice bathing in the Ore Mountains 2014" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Yoga class and ice bathing in the Ore Mountains 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1693467207"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A special moment in Copenhagen&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Since that first encounter, yoga has become a constant part of my life. In 2018 I had the opportunity to bring my passion into a very special setting at the SAP Community Event in Copenhagen. At the end of my talk, I sat down cross-legged on stage while the audience remained in their seats. Behind me, an animated GIF was running in my presentation, visualizing the rhythm of box breathing:&lt;BR /&gt;inhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, exhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds.&lt;BR /&gt;Together we followed this rhythm – and for a moment the large conference room became completely silent. Everyone was connected through the same breathing pattern. This experience was surprising for many and deeply moving for me: a moment where technology, community, and mindfulness came together in a very powerful way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1496953702"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A special honor for me on World Mental Health Day&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Another highlight was October 10th 2023, the international World Mental Health Day. On this day, I was invited to lead an international yoga session for my company. People from different countries and time zones came together virtually to breathe, move, and pause for a moment. For me it was a great honor and at the same time a confirmation that mindfulness and yoga go far beyond private practice – they can build bridges, create community, and have a tangible impact in a global professional environment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1300440197"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What yoga means to me&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For me, yoga is far more than physical exercises. It is an attitude that shapes everyday life – both professionally and personally. It reminds me that behind every role and function there is always a human being. This perspective has changed my leadership style: away from pure control, towards more trust, calmness, and leading by example. In my company, some colleagues jokingly call me “Yoda” – a nice sign that mindfulness not only brings calm but also inspiration. For me, yoga is a compass that helps me stay clear, human, and connected even in challenging situations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Practicing Vrksasana Yoga “Tree Pose” on a hike." style="width: 667px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317117i7BA71D4637A7435A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Yoga_Der Baum.jpeg" alt="Practicing Vrksasana Yoga “Tree Pose” on a hike." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Practicing Vrksasana Yoga “Tree Pose” on a hike.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1103926692"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Running, swimming, and the strength of connecting with others&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Back in 2000, I joined a group mainly consisting of triathletes and hockey players. That was the moment I finally started running – something I had enjoyed before but never really practiced regularly.&lt;BR /&gt;My last major run was in 2014 in Vienna, a city that holds a special place in my heart.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Last year – as well as this year – I completed an Olympic triathlon. Swimming has always had a calming effect on me, running grounds me in the here and now, and the combination of all three disciplines teaches me perseverance, humility, and trust in my own body.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I remember well the SAP Community Event in Copenhagen in May 2018 – that’s where I met&amp;nbsp;@smarchesini .&lt;BR /&gt;Sebastiano is not only someone who drives SAP topics forward, but also someone who shares his passion for running with others.&lt;BR /&gt;I am delighted that he will be next in this hobbies series – because running connects us, and I am sure his story will bring fresh inspiration.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Photo of me taken during a race at a multi-generational run" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317118i20C526BEDDE7E2FE/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="3 Lauf der Generationen 384.JPG" alt="Photo of me taken during a race at a multi-generational run" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Photo of me taken during a race at a multi-generational run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-907413187"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Join the conversation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Do you do Yoga or Meditation? Share the pictures and stories behind them in the comments section. Feel free to share other hobbies you have!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If you're interested in joining the series, please reach out to Moshe Naveh via community@sap.com.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Let's get this journey going!

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Community Members,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for sharing your feedback and concerns with us.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The primary change is that SAP Universal ID will no longer function as an identity provider. This modification to the login process is a crucial component of a broader initiative aimed at streamlining user management. It also serves as a technical foundation that will eventually allow customers to integrate their own corporate identity providers seamlessly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Other substantial features of SAP Universal ID will stay: Your SAP Universal ID continues to serve as a wallet for managing your user identities. It ensures lifelong access to your account and preserves your reputation such as learning certificates and community content.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We apologize for the temporary inconvenience caused by the need to manage multiple user identities and manually switch between them due to the recent changes. SAP is currently developing an account switcher functionality to alleviate this issue.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the new functionality is implemented, you will log in using your S/P-user or the associated email address. After logging in, the system will display all user identities (S/P-users) linked to your UID. You can then switch to another user identity by clicking on it and entering the associated password.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information about future developments in authentication for digital platforms, you can refer to this&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2025/04/byoi-sap-identity-authentication-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;News Article&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u816a-1_iTI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;YouTube interview.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To bring up improvement requests directly, join our&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/3831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Continuous Influence session&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;to share detailed ideas and requirements on bring your own identity, S-user management, and SAP Universal ID, ensuring clarity and effective review by SAP (an S-user is required to submit improvement requests).&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Actually, as apart of material code creation, here they followed different ways one is manual creation through MM01 and other way is through Data services.

    <content>Thanks Chris for your response. I noted that as there is no event driven mechanism now for custom objects. Side by side is always an option, but it is somehow loosing a momentum of the solution.</content>

    <content>Start with this Learning Journey "Discovering End-to-End Business Processes for the Intelligent Enterprise", it helps you understand the broad end to end processes in SAP, at a high level. From there you can dive deeper into a topic that you're interested in (i.e. FICO or similar).

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you very much for your question.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please check whether the following information (&lt;SPAN&gt;GenAI was used to help generate this content.&lt;/SPAN&gt;) is useful.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Migrating SAP Router to an Azure Virtual Machine protected by Zscaler involves several considerations, especially regarding the compatibility of SAP’s private protocols with Zscaler’s Zero-Trust policies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2019273919"&gt;Key Considerations:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Router Functionality&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Router is a crucial component for managing remote connections between SAP systems and clients like SAPGUI. It uses proprietary protocols for authentication and communication.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Zscaler Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Zscaler provides a cloud-based security platform that enforces Zero-Trust policies, which might affect how SAP Router communicates with SAPGUI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) can potentially replace SAP Router by providing secure access to internal applications without the need for a VPN.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Compatibility and Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensure that Zscaler’s policies allow the necessary SAP protocols to pass through without interference.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You may need to configure Zscaler to recognize and allow SAP Router’s traffic, ensuring that authentication and data integrity are maintained.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Testing and Validation&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Conduct thorough testing to ensure that SAPGUI can still connect seamlessly through SAP Router when protected by Zscaler.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Validate that all security policies are correctly applied and do not disrupt SAP Router’s functionality.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1822760414"&gt;Recommendations:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consult with SAP and Zscaler Support&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Engage with both SAP and Zscaler support teams to understand the best practices for integrating SAP Router with Zscaler.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pilot Testing&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Before full migration, conduct pilot tests to identify any potential issues and ensure smooth operation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Documentation and Training&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Ensure that your technical team is well-informed about the changes and trained on managing the new setup.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While there is limited information available online about this specific integration, these steps should help guide you through the process. If you have further questions, consulting with experts who have experience in SAP and Zscaler integration might be beneficial.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Henrike&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Good day&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1424802"&gt;@byd&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Have a look at &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ERP/526b9006b5a2427da1d730b66181ea8d/7e1e6584603711da36bb000f20dac9ef.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=6.05.latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Supplier Invoice Processing&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/CENTRAL_INVOICE_MANAGEMENT/76e9f80544ca4990b6d25b79a1d0602f/43495ee9483a42b1a7ce74001ea0847b.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Overview of SAP Ariba Central Invoice Management&lt;/A&gt; &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/c0c54048d35849128be8e872df5bea6d/53e6b50df8094b36b062f4828bfcd3d0.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;amp; Invoice List Partner&lt;/A&gt; for more details.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In summary, there is currently no built-in OCR capability to scan and capture supplier invoices from PDF or paper format directly into the system in the public cloud. Standard supplier invoice processing is available in the Fiori apps (such as Create Supplier Invoice, Create Supplier Invoice- Advanced), and electronic invoice can be integrated through APIs and interfaces.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you require OCR invoice capture, the recommended approach from SAP is for you to use SAP central Invoice Management which integrates with SAP Business Network. This solution provides scanning, OCR machine learning-based extraction of invoice data. Please note that this requires additional licensing.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Alternatively, you can integrate a third-party OCR solution from SAP Store. This will enable you feed invoice data into the public cloud through SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introdution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog we look at the importance of legacy bonus plan eligibility rules in Variable Pay. We can turn them on with the following checkboxes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="xavierlegarrec_0-1759126718624.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320906i63CAE9F181663F9D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="xavierlegarrec_0-1759126718624.png" alt="xavierlegarrec_0-1759126718624.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="xavierlegarrec_1-1759126732343.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320907iE0E42CBF270A0601/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="xavierlegarrec_1-1759126732343.png" alt="xavierlegarrec_1-1759126732343.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;They are the only ones that will work both for EC records and Imported (non-EC) records (EC bonus plan rules only work for EC imported records) and as such are critical to handle the following scenarios:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Case of permanently transferred employees (for example 1/1 to 3/31 employee of the Peru legal entity then 4/1 to 9/1 employee of the Canada legal entity and since 9/2 employee of the US legal entity) where customer needs to export the data for the different userID retrieved from EC and load it under the ID of the latest active record in order for the full payout to show up on the statement of the most current active record of the employee.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Case of EC data missing for the first cycle (for example bonus cycle is 1/1 to 12/31 and EC data cutover was 9/1 so two third of the fiscal year data of reference is missing in EC and needs to be imported in the VarPay template's Employee History.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is supported and not supported in legacy rules based on the few information I was able to gather and most importantly based on my own testing in my demo environment:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SUPPORTED : OR conditions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SUPPORTED : OR + AND conditions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;NOT SUPPORTED : &amp;gt;

    <content>Hi Chris, your post is well written – however, it’s unfortunately not relevant in this context, as we’re dealing with the S/4HANA Public Cloud, not ECC. Would you mind reviewing your post to see if it might be worth adjusting or possibly removing it? Thanks a lot and best regards,</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Automating Custom Performance Data Transfer to Employee Profiles&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At SAP SuccessFactors, dynamic employee profile is the heart of a successful Human Experience Management (HXM) strategy. &amp;nbsp;If your client wants to transfer critical information from &lt;STRONG&gt;Performance Form to Employee Profile&lt;/STRONG&gt; through seamless user interface, this is possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Performance Form&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consider a scenario within SuccessFactors, a manager completes a Performance Management Form, that includes custom section – with Field 1, Field 2, Field 3. &amp;nbsp;This data needs to be pushed to Employee Profile – Background element.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Singh_28_0-1757923727311.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/314242i0F3F3C7454A396EA/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Singh_28_0-1757923727311.png" alt="Singh_28_0-1757923727311.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Employee profile &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Employee Profile in SAP SuccessFactors is a centralized repository that captures employee skills, experiences, education, and career preferences, supporting talent management, succession planning, and development initiatives across organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here, we have a Background element configured that includes Field 1, Field 2, Field 3.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Screenshot added below for reference.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Singh_28_1-1757923727326.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/314244i3C2BD5A95633A1FB/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Singh_28_1-1757923727326.png" alt="Singh_28_1-1757923727326.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Diagram&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The technical diagram below illustrates the integration flow built using SAP BTP Integration Suite to enable data exchange between Performance Form custom fields and the Employee Profile background element. It outlines the key steps involved, including API calls, data transformation, and posting using OData APIs. This setup leverages cloud integration capabilities to ensure smooth and automated data transfer between the two SuccessFactors modules.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Singh_28_2-1757923727329.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/314243iC9468820F9627172/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Singh_28_2-1757923727329.png" alt="Singh_28_2-1757923727329.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical specifications&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Leveraging the Cloud Integration capability of Integration Suite service on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) you can easily connect various data elements to exchange data. We will be doing the same over here to exchange data between &lt;STRONG&gt;Performance Form custom fields&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Employee Profile&lt;/STRONG&gt; – background element.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope you're doing well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have a requirement to add a &lt;STRONG&gt;custom field&lt;/STRONG&gt; to both the &lt;STRONG&gt;Task List Operation Detail Screen&lt;/STRONG&gt; and the &lt;STRONG&gt;Order Operation Detail Screen&lt;/STRONG&gt; in ECC 6.0 EHP8. I’ve explored several enhancement options including &lt;STRONG&gt;user exits&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;BADIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but haven’t been able to achieve the desired outcome.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please note that using a &lt;STRONG&gt;User Field or Field Key&lt;/STRONG&gt; is not a viable option in this case, as we require a &lt;STRONG&gt;character field with a length of up to 60&lt;/STRONG&gt;, whereas the user field supports only up to 20 characters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Could you kindly advise on the most suitable enhancement approach to achieve this requirement? Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you in advance for your support.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rahul&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/PLM+Enterprise+Asset+Management+%252528EAM%252529%25252FPlant+Maintenance+%252528PM%252529/pd-p/430019464658497915145476514330950" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1027-1"&gt;PLM Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)/Plant Maintenance (PM)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+EAM+Work+Order/pd-p/01200615320800003602" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="550-1"&gt;SAP EAM Work Order&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Good day&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2182684"&gt;@FaisalMaayeh&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question to the community.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Have a look at &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/32da8359c8ee4e8b8e8c5e15cacba5aa/11fae0d93efe425cbead100510ab4b3c.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Handling Units in Cloud Processes&lt;/A&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ERP/acdf75344f35490089391098f8a7bf09/ada4bd534f22b44ce10000000a174cb4.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=6.05.latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Batch Management&lt;/A&gt; for more details.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In summary, you are correct that the Serial Number app in the SH4C is intended for serialised products and not for pallets. If your requirement is to tract supplier assigned pallet IDs and their storage bins, then you should consider a few approaches:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If EWM is in scope, handling units will come serve the purpose. Here you can model each pallet as handling unit, assign the supplier serial number to the HU (either as HU external ID or as an HU characteristic) and then you manage bin assignments through warehouse tasks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If your HU management is not activated, you could use Batch Management. Please note, if you create a characteristic for Supplier Pallet Serial Number, you can record pallet Ids during goods receipt and track them at batch level. &amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/32da8359c8ee4e8b8e8c5e15cacba5aa/11fae0d93efe425cbead100510ab4b3c.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Handling Units in Cloud Processes&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Finally, you can alternatively use Custom Fields and Logic to extend goods receipt document with a custom field for pallet serial number. This will you to capture the supplier’s ID without changing standard material serialisation. &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/FIORI_IMPLEMENTATION/6f48ffcd33f4470fb61e5cfeec4e634a/40d3a9b11e77438e865bdff21d9cff72.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=1909.latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Custom Fields and Custom Business Logic&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this provides the desired insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1630177824"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP MDG-M, the standard User Interface (UI) is designed to load the full set of content, ensuring complete visibility but often at the cost of speed and responsiveness. While this “load-everything” approach guarantees access to all data, it also introduces performance bottlenecks that slow down day-to-day work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a team, we explored ways to mitigate these performance challenges and developed a Custom UI solution tailored to our specific needs. But how much of a difference does this new UI make?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To answer this, we conducted structured performance tests, analyzing key factors such as page load times, system resource utilization, and user feedback. This study will reveal the concrete benefits of the new Custom UI compared to standard UIs, providing insights for future optimization efforts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1433664319"&gt;Background&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;A good user experience is a key requirement for any user-centric application. As SAP MDG is an enterprise solution involving hundreds of fields per domain, it’s very important to display the relevant role-specific information at each governance process step in a user-friendly manner. This will help the data stewards and data analysts make smart decisions with the help of simple and responsive UIs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard UIs provide a solid foundation for these processes, ensuring consistency and reliability across the system. As data volumes and usage scenarios expand, however, opportunities emerge to further optimize performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;User feedback and technical performance analyses highlighted areas where the standard UIs could be further optimized — particularly around load times, resource usage, and navigation flow. To address these opportunities, our team designed a Custom UI solution focused on boosting performance and enhancing usability, while still building on the strengths of the existing framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this study, we assess the impact of Custom UIs on performance and compare them with existing standard UIs. The goal is to determine the areas where improvements have been achieved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1237150814"&gt;Test Methodology and Scope&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;To measure these differences objectively, we conducted rigorous performance tests under identical conditions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1556968185"&gt;For performance analysis, we focused on the following criteria:&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Page Load Time: A crucial factor affecting user experience&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;System Resource Utilization: Efficiency in memory (RAM), CPU, and database queries&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;User Feedback: Objective evaluation through surveys and scores&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tests were conducted under predefined conditions using identical datasets. Below are the tools and test conditions used.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1360454680"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Testing Tool:&amp;nbsp; Http Trace Using&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;UI Type: Standard UI (BS_MAT_OVP_09H) - Average Load Time:&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;1789 msn&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Standard UI http trace.png" style="width: 880px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/310581i2E4838267C255AC3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="AhmetZ_2-1757256098389.png" alt="AhmetZ_2-1757256098389.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="1 2 3 4 5 6 7"&gt;Figure 1 – Standard UI http trace&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;UI Type:&amp;nbsp;Custom UI (Z9H_BS_MAT_OVP_09H) -&amp;nbsp;Average Load Time:&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;858 msn&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Custom UI http trace.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/310584i4F1D01A1F3D353C3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="AhmetZ_4-1757256719782.png" alt="AhmetZ_4-1757256719782.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="1 2 3 4 5 6 7"&gt;F&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size="1 2 3 4 5 6 7"&gt;igure 2 – Custom UI http trace&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1163941175"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System Resource Utilization (Memory, CPU, Database Queries)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;UI Type: Standart UI - AT_OVP~BS_MAT_OVP_09&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AhmetZ_6-1757256986669.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/310586i46F9B47F40327BDB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="AhmetZ_6-1757256986669.png" alt="AhmetZ_6-1757256986669.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="1 2 3 4 5 6 7"&gt;Figure 3 – Standard UI System Resource Utilization&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;UI Type: Custom UI - P~Z9H_BS_MAT_OVP_09H&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Custom UI System Resource Utilization.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/310588iDC4C8DF9CD82AE3B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="AhmetZ_8-1757257161192.png" alt="AhmetZ_8-1757257161192.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="1 2 3 4 5 6 7"&gt;Figure 4 – Custom UI System Resource Utilization&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The performance metrics above may vary depending on several factors such as the density of data in the database, system resource usage, network speed, and similar elements. Therefore, performance results may differ under varying conditions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-451096794"&gt;Results and Gains&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our analysis revealed clear benefits that directly strengthen both system efficiency and the user experience.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;To your question &lt;EM&gt;"Does same short/long description = duplicate material?"&lt;/EM&gt;, not necessarily. In SAP, the material number (MATNR) is the true unique identifier. Descriptions (short/long) are just text fields and can be reused across multiple materials. Generic descriptions like “Bolt” or “Cable” are often reused for different sizes/specs. Different plants or business units may create materials with the same description but different control data (valuation class, base unit, procurement type, etc.).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;When you can consider that as a duplication is If all key attributes (material group, base unit, valuation class, procurement type, etc.) are the same, and only the material number differs, then yes—it’s likely a duplicate. Duplicates often arise when materials are created via multiple channels (MM01 manually vs. Data Services migration) without a harmonized governance process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;So if you ask me how to check the duplicates, perform the below steps&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Go to MARA/MARC tables. Compare fields like MATKL (Material Group), MEINS (Base Unit), MTART (Material Type), BKLAS (Valuation Class). If many fields match along with identical descriptions, it’s a strong duplicate candidate.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Use “Old Material Number” (MARA-BISMT) if available → Sometimes legacy codes are stored here and can help identify duplicates.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I would like to upload the file that are stored in DMS to Microsoft sharepoint.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our current plan is&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. User will upload the attachment files from Build Process Automation approval form.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. The attachment files will be stored in Document Management Service, Integration Option.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Since all of the history records are removed from "My Inbox" when approver approved/rejected the approval request form.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We would like to keep the attachments and approval request form data in Microsoft sharepoint.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, How can we upload the files of DMS to Microsoft sharepoint.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I did not find any related documents/blogs regarding to No.3.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, if you have any documents/blogs or any information about this, could you please share with me?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Aye Chan&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Freya,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based your description, I suggest that you can leverage several BAdIs to meet your requirement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First is&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;LOBM_AFTER_BATCH_NUMBER_INT, you can use this BAdI to create a new batch number and adapt it. But the limitation is that it only works when the batch number doesn't exist. So you can implement some logics to check if in I_BATCH, the batch number exists. If exists, you need to use BAdI MMIM_GR4XY_PROVIDE_DATA and MMIM_ITEM_PROVIDE_DATA. These BAdIs can help you to change data in goods receipt and material documents. So they can work in the APP MIGO and Post Goods Receipt. You can implement some logics to change the relevant fields' value.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hope my answer can help you to solve the question.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Zhehui&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;While working on a project to optimize a standard SAP report that struggled with large data volumes, I took a deep dive into &lt;STRONG&gt;performance tuning&lt;/STRONG&gt; in ABAP, specifically focusing on &lt;STRONG&gt;parallel processing&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This journey led me to a comprehensive analysis of the various methods SAP provides for running processes in parallel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I discovered that parallel processing in ABAP is achieved using one of two core technologies. The first is the &lt;STRONG&gt;Remote Function Call (RFC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where both &lt;STRONG&gt;asynchronous (aRFC)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;background (bgRFC)&lt;/STRONG&gt; variants can be used to run tasks in parallel. The second technology is based on &amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;background processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;. To make implementation easier, several &lt;STRONG&gt;frameworks&lt;/STRONG&gt; have been built on top of these technologies, simplifying the development process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog post is a &lt;STRONG&gt;summary&lt;/STRONG&gt; of the theoretical research I conducted for my bachelor's thesis. Its goal is to provide a &lt;STRONG&gt;comprehensive overview&lt;/STRONG&gt; of the different technologies and the six key frameworks I identified.

To simplify their use, multible frameworks have been developed for easier implementation. The following table provides an overview of these technologies and their corresponding frameworks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="marc_steinert_0-1758550065480.png" style="width: 706px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/318006iFE283EECD9A1C02A/image-dimensions/706x145?v=v2" width="706" height="145" role="button" title="marc_steinert_0-1758550065480.png" alt="marc_steinert_0-1758550065480.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, let's explore how each of these core technologies enables parallel processing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1822605757"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Asynchronous Remote Function Call (aRFC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Asynchronous Remote Function Call&lt;/STRONG&gt; is one of the older and established SAP technology for parallel processing in ABAP. It works by starting a session in a separate &lt;STRONG&gt;dialog work process&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which then executes a function module in parallel with the main program. The calling program does not wait for the function to finish and continues its own processing immediately.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By starting multiple aRFCs in a row, you can achieve a significant parallelization effect, as each call runs simultaneously in its own process. This is implemented using the &lt;EM&gt;STARTING NEW TASK&lt;/EM&gt; addition to the standard &lt;EM&gt;CALL FUNCTION&lt;/EM&gt; statement. A example call could look like this:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;CALL FUNCTION '&amp;lt;function_module_name&amp;gt;'
STARTING NEW TASK '&amp;lt;task_name&amp;gt;'
DESTINATION IN GROUP &amp;lt;server_group&amp;gt;
PERFORMING &amp;lt;callback_form&amp;gt; ON END OF TASK.&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;P&gt;For a more detailed guide on aRFCs, check out these resources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Book: Gahm, H.

While it also uses dialog work processes for execution like the aRFC, its operational logic is quite different.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of executing immediately, a bgRFC call is first saved to a &lt;STRONG&gt;persistent queue&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the database. The actual processing is only triggered by an explicit &lt;EM&gt;COMMIT WORK&lt;/EM&gt; statement and is managed by a dedicated &lt;STRONG&gt;scheduler&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This approach makes it possible to execute tasks with an &lt;STRONG&gt;"Exactly Once"&lt;/STRONG&gt; or even an &lt;STRONG&gt;"Exactly Once in Order"&lt;/STRONG&gt; guarantee, which provides a high degree of reliability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The implementation is nearly identical to that of an aRFC. The key difference is the use of the &lt;EM&gt;IN BACKGROUND UNIT&lt;/EM&gt; statement, which groups one or more function calls into a single, logical unit of work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;CALL FUNCTION '&amp;lt;function_module_name&amp;gt;'
IN BACKGROUND UNIT &amp;lt;unit_object&amp;gt;.&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can find more information about this technology here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-focused-run/expert-portal/integration-cloud-monitoring/bgrfc.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Support: bgRFC&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/753088fc00704d0a80e7fbd6803c8adb/48927c2caa6b17cee10000000a421937.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal: bgRFC (Background Remote Function Call)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1429578747"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background Processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using dedicated &lt;STRONG&gt;Background Processes&lt;/STRONG&gt; is another established method for achieving parallelism in SAP Systems, especially suitable for long-running and resource-intensive tasks that can be clearly divided.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Parallelizing with background processes follows the same core principle as with aRFCs: multiple tasks are started to run simultaneously. This can be achieved in two main ways. The first approach is done purely through configuration. Here, an administrator can manually schedule the same ABAP program multiple times, where each parallel &lt;STRONG&gt;job&lt;/STRONG&gt; uses a unique &lt;STRONG&gt;variant&lt;/STRONG&gt; with a different dataset&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second approach is to implement this parallelization within a single ABAP program. This is done using a set of function modules that control the job lifecycle:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;JOB_OPEN&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; creates a new job.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;JOB_SUBMIT&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; adds the program and its variant as a step.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;JOB_CLOSE&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; releases the job to the system for execution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more details on implementing parallel background jobs, check out these resources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-and-automation-blog-posts/parallel-processing-with-background-jobs-in-sap/ba-p/14001745" target="_self"&gt;SAP Community (2025): Parallel Processing with Background Jobs in SAP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/7bfe8cdcfbb040dcb6702dada8c3e2f0/4d95304dd1b83c46e10000000a42189e.html?locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal: Programming with the Background Processing System (BC-CCM-BTC)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-and-automation-blog-posts/parallel-processing-of-background-jobs-in-sap/ba-p/13244439" target="_self"&gt;SAP Community (2014):&amp;nbsp;Parallel processing of background jobs in SAP&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1103982523"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frameworks for Easier Implementation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the core technologies provide the fundamental mechanisms for parallel processing, implementing them directly requires handling details like load balancing, package creation and managing parallel tasks. To simplify this process, SAP provides several &lt;STRONG&gt;frameworks&lt;/STRONG&gt; that build on these technologies. These frameworks offer a structured, reusable and often easier way to implement robust parallel processing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To select the most suitable framework, the following decision matrix based on the Qualitative Weight and Summ (QWS) method provides a visual comparison. The &lt;STRONG&gt;darker the green shade&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the better a framework fulfills a specific criterion. Please note that this matrix reflects my subjective evaluation for a specific use case. Your assessment will likely differ based on your project's unique requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="marc_steinert_1-1758550429007.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/318022i6DE4D8A1A7502555/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="marc_steinert_1-1758550429007.png" alt="marc_steinert_1-1758550429007.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Evaluation Criteria Explained&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is a brief summary of each criterion used in the matrix:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Platform Compatibility:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Runs on both SAP ECC and S/4HANA systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Timeout Robustness:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Handles long-running tasks without timing out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Package Creation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Automatically divides data into work packages.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Configurable Package Size:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Allows the developer to define the size of work packages.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Parallel Execution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Automatically starts and manages the execution of parallel tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Result Aggregation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Helps collect and consolidate results from parallel tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-Server Function:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Can distribute tasks across multiple application servers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Processing Server Selection:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Allows specifying a server or server group for execution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Load Balancing:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Automatically distributes tasks based on system load.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System Load Control:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Allows setting limits on the maximum system resources used.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implementation Effort:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The complexity and time required to implement the framework.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Documentation Quality:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The availability and quality of supporting documentation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now lets have a look at the individual Frameworks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1036551737"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SPTA Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;SPTA Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt; provides a straightforward, function-module-based approach to simplify parallel processing with aRFCs. Instead of requiring the developer to manage the aRFC calls manually, the framework encapsulates the entire parallelization logic within a single, reusable function module, &lt;EM&gt;SPTA_PARA_PROCESS_START_2&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To use the SPTA framework, a developer implements three specific form routines that serve as callbacks, filling them with the custom logic required for the application. The &lt;EM&gt;BEFORE_RFC_CALLBACK_FORM&lt;/EM&gt; is responsible for preparing the data and creating the work packages. The core processing logic, which is to be executed in parallel, is placed within the &lt;EM&gt;IN_RFC_CALLBACK_FORM&lt;/EM&gt;. After all the parallel tasks have been completed, the &lt;EM&gt;AFTER_RFC_CALLBACK_FORM&lt;/EM&gt; is called to consolidate the results and make them available for further processing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information on the SPTA Framework, see these resources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3002940/E" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP for Me (2020): 3002940 - Parallel Processing FAQ&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://sapyard.com/spta-parallel-processing-framework-in-abap" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;[Non SAP] SAPYARD (2018): SPTA Parallel Processing Framework in ABAP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lets-talk-spta-framework-your-guide-parallel-sap-dzmitryi-kharlanau-1skaf/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;[Non SAP] LinkedIn (2024): Let’s Talk About the SPTA Framework: Your Guide to Parallel Processing in SAP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-840038232"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SHDB Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;SHDB Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a more powerful and modern, object-oriented framework that also simplifies the use of aRFCs. It is structured into four main components that work together to provide a robust parallelization environment: the &lt;STRONG&gt;Package Provider&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Resource Provider&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Parallelizer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the &lt;STRONG&gt;Dispatcher&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Package Provider&lt;/STRONG&gt; is responsible for automatically dividing the total dataset into smaller, processable packages according to configurable rules. The &lt;STRONG&gt;Resource Provider&lt;/STRONG&gt; actively monitors the system's memory and process utilization to determine the maximum allowed number of parallel tasks, thereby preventing system overloads. The &lt;STRONG&gt;Parallelizer&lt;/STRONG&gt; then calls the application-specific logic for each package in a separate aRFC task, while the &lt;STRONG&gt;Dispatcher&lt;/STRONG&gt; coordinates the entire process by requesting packages and resources and launching the asynchronous tasks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Implementation is done in an object-oriented manner, starting with the factory class &lt;EM&gt;CL_SHDB_PFW_FACTORY&lt;/EM&gt; and using configuration objects from &lt;EM&gt;CL_SHDB_PFW_CONFIG&lt;/EM&gt; to define parameters like the number of parallel processes or package parameters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While a complete guide for the SHDB Framework is not publicly available at this time, some information can be found on the SAP for Me portal. Relevant resources are available there using the search terms &lt;STRONG&gt;"SHDB Framework"&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;"SHDB PFW"&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-643524727"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CL_ABAP_PARALLEL&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;CL_ABAP_PARALLEL&lt;/STRONG&gt; framework is another object-oriented solution for aRFC-based parallelization. Its name, while not official, comes from its original project folder. It is a lightweight solution centered around a main class and an interface that developers use to structure their parallel logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The implementation pattern requires the developer to create a processing class that implements the &lt;EM&gt;IF_ABAP_PARALLEL&lt;/EM&gt; interface. All the custom logic intended to run in parallel is then placed within its &lt;EM&gt;DO&lt;/EM&gt; method. Finally, the entire process is managed by an instance of the main &lt;EM&gt;CL_ABAP_PARALLEL&lt;/EM&gt; class and the parallel execution is triggered by calling the &lt;EM&gt;RUN_INST&lt;/EM&gt; method.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information on &lt;STRONG&gt;CL_ABAP_PARALLEL&lt;/STRONG&gt;, see these resources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Book: Schwarzmann, W.

For most use cases, &lt;EM&gt;IF_BGMC_OP_SINGLE&lt;/EM&gt; is used to ensure the process follows strict transactional rules for data consistency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once this class with the business logic is ready, it is passed to the &lt;EM&gt;CL_BGMC_PROCESS_FACTORY&lt;/EM&gt;. This is a helper class provided by the framework that constructs the main process object for the background task. The task is then registered by calling the &lt;EM&gt;save_for_execution()&lt;/EM&gt; method and the entire process is finally triggered by a &lt;EM&gt;COMMIT WORK&lt;/EM&gt; statement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information on the bgPF, see these resources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-concepts/background-processing-framework" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Protal: Background Processing Framework&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-the-background-processing-framework/ba-p/13579056" target="_self"&gt;SAP Community (2023): Introducing the Background Processing Framework&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-250497717"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Parallel Processing Framework (PPF)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Parallel Processing Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt;, sometimes also referred to as the &lt;STRONG&gt;Framework for Parallel Processing (FPP)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, is a framework based on background processes used to structure and execute mass-data processing runs in parallel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Its implementation requires both settings in Customizing and the development of custom ABAP function modules. A developer first defines an &lt;STRONG&gt;application type&lt;/STRONG&gt; using transaction &lt;EM&gt;BANK_CUS_PPC&lt;/EM&gt;. This application type links specific processing steps, such as data packaging or execution, to the custom-developed function modules that contain the business logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The entire process is then initiated from a report by calling the central function module &lt;EM&gt;BANK_MAP_PP_START&lt;/EM&gt;, which uses the application type's configuration to manage the parallel jobs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information on the PPF, see these resources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-for-banking-blogs/exploring-mass-run-program-based-on-ppf/ba-p/13136452" target="_self"&gt;SAP Community (2015): Exploring Mass run program based on PPF&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/5bec6e0df6b549258e7ae381fedd4066/593e3752aeefbc02e10000000a44176d.html?locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal: Parallel Processing (FPP)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--443732883"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mass Data Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Mass Data Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a comprehensive solution for structuring and controlling complex projects that involve large-scale data changes and is often used in migration scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The implementation requires just like the Parallel Processing Framework a combination of &lt;STRONG&gt;Customizing&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;development&lt;/STRONG&gt;. In Customizing (via transaction SM30), a developer defines the entire project structure. This involves creating a &lt;STRONG&gt;Project Type&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;EM&gt;FINSV_MPROJ_TYP&lt;/EM&gt;), which consists of a sequence of &lt;STRONG&gt;Activities&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;EM&gt;FINSV_MASSF_SET&lt;/EM&gt;). Each activity is made up of one or more &lt;STRONG&gt;Steps&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;EM&gt;FINSV_MASSF_STEP&lt;/EM&gt;), where the custom ABAP logic is assigned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The developer's main task is to create an &lt;STRONG&gt;application class&lt;/STRONG&gt; that contains the business logic for a step. This class must implement the interface &lt;EM&gt;IF_FINS_MASS_DATA&lt;/EM&gt;, which includes three key methods. The &lt;EM&gt;GET_PACKAGES&lt;/EM&gt; method is called to define the work packages. The &lt;EM&gt;PREPARE &lt;/EM&gt;method can be used for any setup tasks before the parallel processing starts. Finally, the &lt;EM&gt;PROCESS &lt;/EM&gt;method contains the core logic that is executed in parallel for each individual package.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As it is an older framework, further resources for the Mass Data Framework are primarily located on internal SAP platforms and are not publicly available.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope you found this overview informative and that it helps you tackle your own performance tuning challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A special thanks to &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/226501"&gt;@ManuS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the help and guidance!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

At the moment, the app cannot be extended to handle more than the intended quantity simultaneously.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If your business process requires comparing more than three quotations at the same time, you may consider some alternatives:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Make use of the app in groups&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can use the analytical apps like Monitor Supplier Quotations which allows you to filter and export your data for broader comparison.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can build a custom analytical report via CDS views and Custom Analytical Queries to display all relevant quotations side by side in Excel or SAC.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this provides the desired insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

With IAM, organizations can establish, tailor, and monitor business roles to business needs and requirements. There are several relevant applications available for managing IAM in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP EarlyWatch Alert provides an overview of relevant information and resources to enable the effective use of IAM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1435480387"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1238966882"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deprecated Business Catalogs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is important to adapt existing Business Catalogs and Business Roles resulting from the addition of new scope items or a release upgrade. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, Business Catalogs are periodically revised. Some Business Catalogs will be deprecated and replaced by new ones. The&amp;nbsp;deprecated Business Catalogs in the system may be removed by SAP at the time of a release after it has been declared as deprecated, so it is important to review the deprecated Business Catalogs after each release along with new scope items and make the necessary changes as soon as possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this chapter, a list of deprecated business catalogs in use in the system and information how to handle this is provided.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1042453377"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Users Assigned to Many Business Roles&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP best practice is to assign only one business role to a business user. Each business role must represent a workplace and business roles should be created from scratch using the workplace approach.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For production, it is strongly recommended to build production roles manually to ensure compliance with external and internal compliance rules for access.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the this chapter, the system is checked for users that have multiple business roles assigned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-845939872"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Assignment of users to Business Role SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The role SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR is predefined by SAP and is intended only for the initial configuration of a system.&amp;nbsp;Usage of this role in production does not correspond to SAP recommendations and may lead to compliance issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system is checked for the usage of this role in this chapter to alert on the potential risk that comes along with using it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-649426367"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use of Read/Write Unrestricted&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using unrestricted fields in the maintenance of business roles allow users to have global data access, SAP best practices recommend to carefully review which users need to have restricted data access and maintain the access appropriately, e.g. ensuring employees only have access to data belonging to their sales organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This chapter informs about the number of busines roles with unrestricted write, read or value help access.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Use of Read/Write Unrestricted Result Table Example" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320467i27356E2C63440B60/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jana_pfeffer_1-1758886279904.png" alt="Use of Read/Write Unrestricted Result Table Example" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Use of Read/Write Unrestricted Result Table Example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-452912862"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Catalog Assignments&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business catalogs contain a bundle of privileges needed for accessing an app or features that are then assigned to users via business roles. This section checks for selected critical business catalogs and their assignment to business roles and users and rates this according to the valuationrules from &lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://me.sap.com/notes/863362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;863362&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;In case any critical business catalogs are assigned, additional details are presented as sub-chapters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Business Catalog Assignments Overview Table Example" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320462i742507EE2D6597F7/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jana_pfeffer_0-1758885937645.png" alt="Business Catalog Assignments Overview Table Example" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Business Catalog Assignments Overview Table Example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-256399357"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-59885852"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Communication (Inbound/Outbound)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is recommended that certificate-based communication is used for technical users involved in inbound/outbound communication when possible. Usually, it is easier to detect if a certificate is compromised than detect if a password has been compromised. This chapter identifies whether any customer managed communication arrangements do not use certificate-based authenticate and provides a list of them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--136627653"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Upcoming Certificate Expiration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In case there are any certificates where their expiration date is coming up in the next 90 days, they will be listed in this chapter to notify about this early on.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Do you want to &lt;EM&gt;learn more on how to find and use the security relevant content &lt;/EM&gt;in the SAP EarlyWatch Alert Workspace?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I was fortunate to attend the SIT NSQ day on Friday, despite a late start and traffic delays. I had indicated I was tentative since it's a bit of a drive, and home life/chores may prioritize over travel. We finally got to the parking garage around 3 pm, leaving only time for the last session.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Apologies to &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/97"&gt;@RichHeilman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; and &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/139"&gt;@thomas_jung&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and other speakers for missing their sessions. The AI demo was interesting, and applicable outside the SAP ecosystem even to my volunteer work with Scouts, as I shared with &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/148"&gt;@josh_bentley&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; after the sessions ended.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But this story is about "getting in." I had marked my attendance as tentative even up to the time we were leaving. When my partner and I got to the front desk, I got the stonewall of "name not on list" like Studio 54 back in the day. There was no attendees list, and when they asked me to call my host, I thought, wow, I don't have many Community member phone numbers anymore. I looked at my email and found &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/109"&gt;@StephanieMarley&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;. Meanwhile, a staffer begrudgingly went to find us an escort after I pointed at the event details on the large screen behind them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I appreciate the security, no doubt. And I have no complaints about the staff (who probably make well under half the average salary at NSQ). Then the user experience challenge gauntlet was thrown as we tried to get badged. The screen entry was bad. Super bad. Keys were super tiny on a touchscreen, latency was sluggish, and any number of times we got kicked back to start over.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Stephanie found her name in the matrix finally, and got our badges printed. I had typo'd my own name due to the horrible keying experience (I'm now &lt;EM&gt;Jamee&lt;/EM&gt;), and I have no idea what my partners name (with am apostrophe) ended up as.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whether the sign in app verified my email or not, I am unclear, as I was fortunate to key that in correctly. I was very tempted to use the example.com domain to obscure myself. But I thought I didn't need to vandalize the workflow, it was already damaged enough.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then the imagery step loomed.&amp;nbsp; Stand up straight, comb your hair, wipe that smirk off your face, and click the shutter icon. The delay time from click to snap was interminable, leaving too long and my attention wandered. The lighting was abysmal with harsh glare and the face ending up in shadow (yet the goatee was well-lit).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can see the results below after the app mailed me our info and images. I hope I kept the frustration off my expression!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kudos to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/403"&gt;@GoLaSalle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for explaining the inside track roster hurdles and welcoming me back into the fold!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="My Mug" style="width: 373px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320827iAF1D1DD322CE1B26/image-dimensions/373x565?v=v2" width="373" height="565" role="button" title="sit-2.jpg" alt="My Mug" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;My Mug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Handling API Rate Limit (HTTP 429) Responses in an iFlow using the HTTP receiver adapter</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;APIs commonly return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when callers exceed rate limits. Historically, handling 429 in SAP iFlows required custom logic (parsing response headers, adding waits or persistence), which introduced complexity around timing and memory management. With the latest HTTP receiver adapter update, you can handle transient 429 responses using configurable retry parameters — reducing custom code and improving reliability.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What is a rate limits in terms of APIs?&lt;BR /&gt;Rate limits control how many API calls are allowed per time window, e.g., per second, per minute, per hour, or per day. Limits vary by API and by account. When limits are exceeded, APIs commonly respond with HTTP 429.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These rate limits have their own advantages and disadvantages. We would not be going into the details of these in this blog. We will discuss only on how to handle the error when we get status code 429 in an iflow using HTTP receiver adapter.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Steps to configure the HTTP receiver adapter&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retry Failed Request — enable this option.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;HTTP Error Response Codes — add the error codes you want the adapter to retry (e.g., 429 for rate-limiting).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retry Interval (seconds) — time between retry attempts. Adjust per API and expected recovery time.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retry Iterations — number of retry attempts.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1526402"&gt;@MischiefMaiden&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ACR – BP email not pulled for statutory report distribution (Public Cloud)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Root cause (most common): OPD is not resolving a TO address for the Statutory Reporting ruleset, so output falls back to Print.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Checklist to fix&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OPD scope:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In Output Parameter Determination, set Show Rules for to be equal to Statutory Reporting, not Billing/eDocument&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Channel&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Ensure the email is specified for your report, such as PH_WHT_BIR2307 and the company code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Receiver:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Use the Business Partner vendor/payee role. Don’t switch to T1 (tax authority) if you anticipate the vendor’s email.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Email Recipient:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Set 'To' to the default application email, the option labelled 'BP email'. Keep CC/BCC as specified direct addresses if necessary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Business Partner&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensure a valid email address is entered in the standard address, with a valid-from date on or before the run date. Optionally, set Preferred Communication to Email.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Re-run and verify&lt;/STRONG&gt;: In Run Statutory Reports, open the Output Item. If it still displays No email recipient maintained, go back and review steps 2–4.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Switching the Receiver to T1 targets the tax authority, so the vendor’s BP email won’t populate; removing the application default email line in Email Recipient also leaves the TO blank, which might be the reason it failed earlier.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Key helpful documentation&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Output Parameter Determination (OPD) – overview of rules (Channel, Receiver, Email Recipient, Email Settings). &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/fdc3cf565b1b6b15e10000000a441470.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal-Output Parameter Determination&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please set the Show Rules to Statutory Reporting before updating the OPD for statutory reporting.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The recommended approach would be, stick with internal number ranges, if you just want sequential numbering. This will be standard and simple. If you need company-code-prefixed numbers, you’ll need a custom enhancement. Create a custom number range object per company code. Implement a BAdI/user exit to build the order number string (AB01XXXXXXXX). Store the prefix logic in a config table so it’s flexible.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A change log table alone can be used to track data modifications without storing full historical snapshots. The main table contains the active business data, while the change log table records only the metadata of each change, such as the key fields of the affected record, change type (insert, update, delete), user, and optionally the reason for change.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;During the RAP save sequence, determinations in the behavior implementation capture these details before the transaction is committed and insert them into the change log table. This approach provides a lightweight audit trail that allows you to track when and by whom changes were made, making it suitable for compliance monitoring, reporting, and troubleshooting, while avoiding the storage overhead of a shadow table that keeps the full data history.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here we see some major key Advantages.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Lower Storage Requirements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; – Since it stores only metadata (keys, change type, timestamp, user, etc.) instead of full data snapshots, it uses significantly less database space than a shadow table.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Better Performance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; – Writing smaller log entries reduces the impact on transaction performance compared to saving entire records.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Simplified Design&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; – Only one additional table is needed, making the data model and maintenance simpler.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Faster Reporting on Changes&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; – The log contains concise, relevant details, making it easier to query and generate audit reports.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regulatory Compliance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; – Still fulfills many compliance and audit requirements by showing who changed what and when.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Steps to achieving&amp;nbsp; the Track Change Log in RAP.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I have create 2 database tables&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For basic details&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Capturing the changes record table&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Gireesh_pg1_0-1758006070495.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/314993i959CCED0CE87A7D7/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Gireesh_pg1_0-1758006070495.png" alt="Gireesh_pg1_0-1758006070495.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;table 2.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Gireesh_pg1_1-1758006096260.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/314995i0CADDEB27C7D95DF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Gireesh_pg1_1-1758006096260.png" alt="Gireesh_pg1_1-1758006096260.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;We have to create root view&amp;nbsp; on top of the database table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Gireesh_pg1_2-1758006134903.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/314997i0F3E918DF975DB00/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Gireesh_pg1_2-1758006134903.png" alt="Gireesh_pg1_2-1758006134903.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Gireesh_pg1_3-1758006160440.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/314999i24BC326893231843/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Gireesh_pg1_3-1758006160440.png" alt="Gireesh_pg1_3-1758006160440.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 3.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;for the basic data definition we have create on metadata extension for front end display.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Metadata.layer:#CORE

By recording only essential metadata such as key fields, change type, user, and timestamps, it creates a lightweight yet reliable audit trail. Combined with RAP determinations during the save sequence, this approach ensures that all changes are captured before commit, enabling transparency, compliance monitoring, and easier troubleshooting. Overall, it strikes the right balance between auditability and performance, making it a smart choice for scenarios where full data history is unnecessary.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;thank you if u have any query please reach out me&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Description:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A RAP BO entity which is not part of the BO composition tree for which it is defined. Defining a foreign entity in the behavior definition enables cross-BO message mapping between the two BOs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Concepts:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;RAP foreign entity is a component of the BC-ESI-RAP RESTful ABAP Programming Model. It is a representation of an external entity, such as a web service, that can be used in an ABAP program. The foreign entity is defined in the ABAP program and can be used to access data from the external source.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Tips &amp;amp; Tricks:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When defining a RAP foreign entity, it is important to ensure that all authentication information is correct. This will ensure that requests are sent securely and that responses are received correctly. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the URL of the external source is correct, as this will ensure that requests are sent to the correct location.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How to use it:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To use a RAP foreign entity, first define the entity in the ABAP program. This includes specifying the URL of the external source, as well as any authentication information that may be required. Once the entity is defined, it can be used to access data from the external source. This can be done using the RAP API, which provides methods for making requests and receiving responses from the external source.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shyam4U_0-1758779361113.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/319667i1BD7D26A3B6E12D5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shyam4U_0-1758779361113.png" alt="Shyam4U_0-1758779361113.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial black,avant garde"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example : &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;"In our system, we have two distinct business entities: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Inventory&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sales Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. Although they are separate, they are fundamentally linked. We manage this connection by using the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;product ID&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; as the key identifier. This ensures that every time a sales order is created, the system automatically checks and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;deducts the correct quantity from the available stock&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in the inventory.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhancing Standard BAPIs: When and How to Do It&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business Application Programming Interfaces (&lt;STRONG&gt;BAPIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;) are one of the most powerful tools in SAP, designed to enable seamless integration between SAP and external systems. In most cases, the &lt;STRONG&gt;standard BAPIs&lt;/STRONG&gt; provided by SAP are sufficient to cover typical business scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, real-world requirements often demand more. Maybe you need an extra field that isn’t delivered, or you have to add custom checks before the data is posted. That’s when &lt;STRONG&gt;enhancing a standard BAPI&lt;/STRONG&gt; becomes necessary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we’ll look at &lt;STRONG&gt;when&lt;/STRONG&gt; it makes sense to enhance a BAPI and &lt;STRONG&gt;how&lt;/STRONG&gt; you can do it safely without breaking SAP best practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;When Should You Enhance a Standard BAPI?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Missing Fields&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Sometimes the delivered BAPI doesn’t expose all the fields you need. For example, a custom field in the material master might not be available.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extra Validations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You may need business-specific checks before the BAPI processes data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Logic Before or After Execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You might want to execute additional steps either before calling the BAPI or right after it completes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration with External Systems&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If you’re mapping SAP data with a third-party system, additional fields or transformations may be needed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Performance Improvements&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In some cases, the standard BAPI processes more than you need. Enhancements can help you fine-tune the performance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to Enhance a Standard BAPI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP provides different ways to enhance BAPIs, depending on the extensibility options available. Let’s go through them one by one:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Using BADI Enhancements (Recommended)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Many standard BAPIs come with &lt;STRONG&gt;Business Add-Ins (BADI)&lt;/STRONG&gt; to make them extensible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Steps:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Check in &lt;STRONG&gt;SE18/SE19&lt;/STRONG&gt; if a BADI exists for the BAPI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Implement the BADI and add your custom logic.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Activate and test.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shantalinga_0-1758866381921.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320103i78596E4A8F912B5C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shantalinga_0-1758866381921.png" alt="Shantalinga_0-1758866381921.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;METHOD if_ex_customer_add_data~check_all_data.

By sticking to SAP’s recommended approaches—such as &lt;STRONG&gt;BADIs, user exits, wrapper functions, and implicit enhancements&lt;/STRONG&gt;—you can deliver the required functionality without risking system stability or upgrade issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The key is to &lt;STRONG&gt;choose the right enhancement technique&lt;/STRONG&gt; based on your scenario, test extensively, and document everything. Done right, BAPI enhancements make your system more flexible while keeping it aligned with SAP best practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Good day&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1761348"&gt;@VickiG1&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question to the Community.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Have a look at &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_INTEGRATIONS/451f9eea67c3442696e7a0a631e9b975/e984a11398a34b348951bdaacb357161.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Replicating Product Master Data&lt;/A&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/warehouse-management-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-2508-release-what/ba-p/14172140" target="_blank"&gt;Warehouse Management in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508 Release – What’s New&lt;/A&gt; for more details.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To summarise, in S4HC, the error message about the Material Status Design &amp;amp; Plan in plant during HU product change is often caused by the warehouse product status and not the plant-level material status.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please note that when you use the Change Product or Batch function in Warehouse Monitor, the system will check whether the product is fully released for warehouse logistics execution. If the product is still in Design &amp;amp; Plan status in the warehouse product master or not extended to the relevant warehouse, then the posting change cannot be executed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Consider doing the following to pinpoint where the error stems from:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Make use of the Manage Product Master Data app to verify that the product you are talking about is extended to warehouse 1010 and has the right logistic status.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensure that you have no restrictions in the warehouse lifecycle status of the material.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If the product is required for operations, activate it for warehouse usage in the product master.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this provides the desired insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;When you transfer the BOM to the network activity/WBS, the system calculates planned costs at the project level. These costs are based on material valuation (standard/average price).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;When production orders are created and account-assigned to the WBS, they bring in their own planned costs (from the production order cost estimate). These are usually more detailed and accurate than the BOM transfer valuation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Due to the above, the WBS now shows two sets of planned costs:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;From the BOM transfer (valuation-based)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;From the production orders (detailed cost estimate)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;This looks like “double counting.”&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;SAP’s recommended practice is use BOM transfer &lt;STRONG&gt;only&lt;/STRONG&gt; for scheduling and component assignment (not for costing). Let production orders drive the planned costs. This way, the WBS reflects only one set of planned costs, aligned with how actuals will be posted.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Chris, thank you for your answer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I tried it, but when i choose the second row with Mail Address = is inital there is always the same error message:&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Item '1': no email recipient has been maintained. APOC_OR_MESSAGES 138 S&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;and the system does not print and sends no mail.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Only when i leave the field Standard Mail Address in the second row empty, then the system prints when there is no mail address. But when a mail address is available, it sends a mail AND it prints - which is wrong as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So do you have any other suggestion?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you and kind regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fabian&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1632019874"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introduction&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;When working with&amp;nbsp;cost center master data&amp;nbsp;in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, we often encounter the need to use different APIs. Depending on the scenario, there can be several options available to integrate, replicate, or maintain cost center data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At first glance, it may seem straightforward to simply use an API. However, the reality is more complex. cost center provides multiple API options, each designed with its own strengths, limitations, and typical use cases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog post aims to bring more clarity by walking through the different API options available for cost center in the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;public cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;context.&amp;nbsp;We will start by explaining some core concepts, such as the difference between synchronous and asynchronous APIs, and how to think about inbound and outbound APIs. Later, we will look into the individual technologies and provide guidance on how to choose the right API for your use case.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1435506369"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1238992864"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Synchronous vs. Asynchronous APIs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most fundamental distinctions when talking about APIs is whether they are&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;synchronous&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;asynchronous&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Synchronous APIs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A synchronous API works like a phone call. You “dial” the API, send a request, and wait for the response. You know immediately whether the operation succeeded or failed. This approach is great for real-time validation, single record maintenance, and interactive applications.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Asynchronous APIs:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An asynchronous API is more like sending a letter or an email. You send the request, and the system processes it in the background. The response may come later, often through a callback, message, or event. This approach is better suited for bulk operations, replication, or integrations where immediate feedback is not required.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In practice, you will often integrate APIs into workflows. A useful guideline is to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stick to one type of API in your workflow&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Mixing synchronous and asynchronous calls can introduce complexity, especially if you need to coordinate responses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Starting with an asynchronous request and then immediately relying on a synchronous call&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;without checking status&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;may fail because the data is not yet processed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you must combine them, always build in the right checks: confirm the asynchronous process is complete before moving to the synchronous step.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="sync_asynch.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320604iD7FF9BC0B87C4E45/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sync_asynch.png" alt="sync_asynch.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1300644797"&gt;Examples: &lt;STRONG&gt;How to work with synchronous/asynchronous APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If your process needs an&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;instant response&lt;/STRONG&gt;, such as validation or single master data change — go for&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;synchronous&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If your process deals with&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;large volumes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;or can wait for processing — &lt;STRONG&gt;asynchronous&lt;/STRONG&gt; is usually more efficient.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-845965854"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-649452349"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Inbound vs. Outbound APIs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another useful way of categorizing APIs is to look at whether they are&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;inbound&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;or&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;outbound&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inbound APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;: These are used when an&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;external system wants to send data to an SAP S/4HANA system&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt; In the cost center context, this could mean creating, updating, or deleting cost center master data from an external application.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Outbound APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;: These are used when an SAP&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA system sends data or events to an external system&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt; In other words, these APIs “push” information out.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="in_out.png" style="width: 573px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320605iF3313C3C8F03643C/image-dimensions/573x358?v=v2" width="573" height="358" role="button" title="in_out.png" alt="in_out.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-452938844"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-256425339"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Technologies&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Working with cost center master data comes with different integration needs, and SAP offers a variety of API technologies to meet them. Each option is designed for specific scenarios and scope items, so choosing the right API depends on your particular requirements. In the sections below, we provide an overview of the key technologies available in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and how they are typically used.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-188994553"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;OData V4:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost Center OData V4&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;service allows you to create, read, update, and delete cost center master data directly in your system. Since it is an&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;inbound, synchronous API&lt;/STRONG&gt;, it is designed for real-time interactions where you need immediate feedback on your changes. The service is built on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;RESTful ABAP Programming Model (RAP)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which ensures it follows modern development principles and supports extensibility. This means you can adapt the data model and business logic to meet your specific requirements without losing compatibility during system upgrades. Typical scenarios for using this API include creating or updating cost centers from external applications or interactive user interfaces, where instant validation and confirmation are important.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/CE_COSTCENTER_0001/overview" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;OData V4 cost center API on API Hub&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--7518952"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Business Object Extensibility (Steampunk API)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;For developers working on&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the cost center business object &amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Steampunk APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;provide another way to interact with cost center master data.

This is useful for reporting, monitoring, or any scenarios where up-to-date cost center information is required for external applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/API_COSTCENTER_SRV/overview" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;OData V2 Read cost center API on API Hub&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--53291605"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Business Events&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When your goal is to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;react to changes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;rather than actively pull data,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Events&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;are the way to go. These are&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;outbound&lt;/STRONG&gt;, meaning S/4HANA pushes notifications to subscribing systems whenever a relevant change occurs. By subscribing to cost center events, a workflow or external application can respond immediately, for example by fetching updated details or triggering additional processes. This event-driven approach is particularly useful for keeping external systems in sync with S/4HANA or automating business processes based on changes in master data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/event/CE_COSTCENTEREVENTS/overview" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Cost center Business Events on API Hub&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--249805110"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SOAP API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As the name suggests, this API transfers the request via SOAP protocol. SOAP API &lt;/SPAN&gt;CostCentreReplicationBulkRequest_In is an &lt;STRONG&gt;inbound, asynchronous &lt;/STRONG&gt;API that can be used for cost center replication into your S/4HANA system. As it is based on asynchronous processing, it is suitable for changes that do not require immediate response. Usage of SOAP APIs in workflows is generally not advised, unless they perform the final operation or an operation that is not prerequisite for a follow-up step.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/COSTCENTREREPLICATIONBULKRQ/overview" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SOAP cost center API on API Hub&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--152915608"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--349429113"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How to choose an API that suits you best&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;While there are many scenarios where you can use cost center APIs. This little breakdown gives you an idea of which technology to use for each case. Whiie various APIs can support certain scenarios, we highlight the ones that offer the best capabilities for the given task.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="table.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320607i19AB676131A7EF91/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="table.png" alt="table.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--545942618"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--742456123"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Combining different APIs in a single workflow&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Earlier, we have outlined the importance of taking caution when working with different technologies in a single workflow. This is especially true if a synchronous API and an asynchronous API coexist in the same stack. Let’s explore possible scenarios and their potential challenges.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1232372635"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Combining Synchronous and Asynchronous APIs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There are multiple systems that can carry out cost center changes. Each system, when the change or creation happens, sends a request to the consolidation system that collects all changes from all systems in the landscape and consolidates them. Periodically, this system returns the consolidated data to the source systems for replication and sends them also to receiver systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If this is done on a time basis, for example, the replication is triggered every midnight, there is no significance whether the replication is carried out synchronously or asynchronously.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;But if there is a condition in place, for example when the replication is triggered after every change request, then the importance of choosing the right technology is essential. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1722289147"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Asynchronous APIs and Their Challenges&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you send a change request via a SOAP API (asynchronous), you would get an immediate response of HTTP status 200, which simply means that the request was accepted, not that the processing is complete. This is often confused as a response to the request being carried out, which is not exactly true. The request was only accepted and (apart from subscription to business event), there is no further notification of a successful completion. It’s important to keep in mind this distinction:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you misinterpret the initial HTTP response as confirmation of successful processing and use it as a trigger for the replication, you could potentially replicate outdated data, as carrying out the change takes time and is dependent on system resources available. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is also unreliable to choose an arbitrary wait time and then follow up with replication. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The only way to ensure proper synchronization is to trigger an additional GET request, verifying you have the expected data in the system. Or you can avoid this hassle by simply carrying out a synchronous request via OData API. Successful response in a synchronous API means that the request is completed in full and the data is processed and persisted. This can safely serve as a trigger condition for your further processing.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="flow_1.png" style="width: 530px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320609i59546770C1301A37/image-dimensions/530x525?v=v2" width="530" height="525" role="button" title="flow_1.png" alt="flow_1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1625399645"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Combining APIs and Business Events&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let’s describe a different scenario where a combination of a business event and an OData API provide a more fluid and efficient integration of a simple workflow. When a cost center is changed in a system, the system implicitly triggers a business event. If there is a listener active, other system can receive this signal with a payload and act according to the desired logic. The payload only consists of the key fields, so when the system recognizes this data as necessary for further processing, it may send an OData GET request to the provider system to retrieve the full data set and persist changes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="flow_2.png" style="width: 693px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320630i4E558CDECF9A09D8/image-dimensions/693x505?v=v2" width="693" height="505" role="button" title="flow_2.png" alt="flow_2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1360326452"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Conclusion&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This post provides a clear overview of the various APIs available for managing cost center master data in SAP S/4HANA Cloud. By understanding the differences between synchronous and asynchronous APIs, inbound and outbound communication, and the specific applications of technologies like OData V4, SOAP, and Business Events, you can choose the most suitable option for your integration needs. Using the right API technology thoughtfully can simplify workflows, ensure data accuracy, and optimize system efficiency. With these insights, you are well-prepared to make the most of the capabilities each API offers while avoiding challenges in complex integrations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;SAP designed the minimum delivery quantity logic to ensure that deliveries below a threshold are not processed at all. It does not distinguish between initial creation and later change. So in standard customizing, there’s &lt;STRONG&gt;no switch&lt;/STRONG&gt; to say &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“only check at creation.”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;One option is if you set the item category minimum delivery quantity check to A, the system will only issue a warning. At creation, users will see the warning but can still proceed. Later, in VL02N, you can reduce to zero without being blocked.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The other standard way is to use Minimum Delivery Quantity only in Sales Order. If you enforce it there, you can leave the delivery item category without the “B” setting. That way, the delivery can still be reduced to zero later if stock is not available.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Due to some reasons, if both the above two options is not acceptable, then, the only option is to go with custom development Try with USEREXIT_SAVE_DOCUMENT_PREPARE in MV50AFZ1 or BAdI LE_SHP_DELIVERY_PROC. In the code, you can check if the delivery is being created vs. changed (using XVBELN or change indicator) and only enforce the minimum quantity rule at creation&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

The performance issues you see are due to the fact that every material change in a maintenance plan operation triggers full validation such as task lists, calls and object lists. That is why working manually in the Fiori app feels very slow.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In regard to mass deletion, the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/f9ba73d1b8c543c2bd2ba1666271af86/b5f4fb481598452bb72c8169c2eedb03.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Maintenance Plan&lt;/A&gt; API allows you to create, update and delete operations but only at single record level. There is currently no delivered function that allows you to delete multiple materials in one payload. This is to prevent accidental removal of large sets of maintenance data that could disrupt scheduling.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You have the possibility to:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Use Api scription or BTP process automation to automate what you would manually delete one by one.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you have larger volumes, you can also consider building a custom app on BTP which then consumes the API to manage maintenance plans in bulk.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you occasionally do once a year clean ups, I recommend focusing on automation as this will surely save you time.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this provides the desired insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

This surely seems to be a bug in the product.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To solve this, I had to change the Url path in the destination to end with&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/odata/v4/workflow/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. This means, the path has to be till the service document or path where the metadata of your CAP service is served. Remember that it has to end with a &lt;STRONG&gt;/&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Then you don't need to add any path in the Resource Path field.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You may have to recreate any actions etc, in the Action Project or start from scratch as it might complain about some other errors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hope the product team does some better error handling or logs as for developers errors in this tool are a nightmare to figure out.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regards,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Melwyn&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2237564"&gt;@ashoktirumalasetti30&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You cannot reliably assign a value to a contract item's custom field using the PO Badi.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In S4 Public Cloud, PO BAdIs such as MM_PUR_S4_PO_MODIFY_ITEM only operate on the PO business object. The open quantity”on a contract is a standard, system-calculated value target minus released, which is updated by the contract release logic after the PO is created, not through a PO writeback to the contract.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Suggested alternative actions&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Avoid creating a duplicate Open Quantity field. Use the standard open/remaining quantity from the contract release data in applications or reports.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you need it for UI or reporting purposes, provide access via analytics using a Custom CDS View that joins contract item and release data or show the default open quantity column in Manage Purchase Contracts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you need to show a value during PO creation, calculate it on the PO side by comparing the contract target with the PO quantity, and display it in a custom PO field. However, avoid trying to update the contract through PO BAdIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Useful SAP Documentation&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;PO BAdIs in Public Cloud scope and limits&lt;/EM&gt;: &lt;A href="https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3089559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP KBA-3089559 - Use of BAdI MM_PUR_S4_PO_OPEN in Purchase Order&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Purchase Contracts app&lt;/EM&gt;: follow-on PO creation and standard fields in the &lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F1600A')/S35" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Fiori Apps Library.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;FAQ / Behaviour of Managing Purchase Orders:&lt;/EM&gt; How PO Logic is Handled in the Cloud - SAP Community FAQ. &lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/s4hana-cloud-sourcing-procurement/manage-purchase-orders-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Community-FAQ for the Manage Purchase Orders App&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me know if you need further assistance&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With kind regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chuma&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Venkat,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is probably because you have assigned the truck MoT for all products hence it is also valid for the material of which you have defined a specific MoT. So you should define the truck MoT only for products that can use it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You have the help documentation for this flag:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1890837985"&gt;Whether Means of Transport Valid for All Products&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Indicates whether the vehicle is valid for all products. If this indicator is set, the vehicle is valid for all products for which there is a product procurement entry. If the vehicle is also assigned to other products, the attributes of the product-specific vehicle are valid. For the products for which there is no product-specific vehicle defined, the system uses the attributes of this vehicle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If the indicator is not set, products are only valid for the vehicle if a product-specific vehicle has been defined for them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cyrille&lt;BR /&gt;Application Innovation Services&lt;BR /&gt;SAP Development Support&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1440770"&gt;@FabianSCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The fact that you are still choosing Default Email Address = is initial remains the reason for the error. This setting does not function as a hard switch to force printing. Instead it still tries to resolve an email channel and fails.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I recommend you keep the EMAIL rule in one determination step with Defaut Email Address = is not initial.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Define your PRINT rule as a separate determination step without any email condition. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This way, if an email exists then the first step triggers email. If no email exists then the first step does not apply and the second step triggers print.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This separation ensures that the system avoids trying to evaluate both rules in the same step and solves the error.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Chris&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>I work on public cloud version of SAP so I think I use the new version of app "manage automatic payments". I don’t have any error messages, and I run the report RFWT0010 but it doesn’t change anything. Thanks’ to your answer. I have to create a case to SAP now.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/180013"&gt;@SimonSch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That was my own misunderstanding &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The field component_type is used to determine data type and search help. The label comes from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;param_text&lt;/STRONG&gt; attribute, so I should not have let it be empty - good catch on your part. And unlike my other code where I do use &lt;STRONG&gt;param_text&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you should of course make use of text-elements which can then be translated, not just hard-coded text.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards&lt;/P&gt;</content>

I would summarize that currently best practise is to use text symbols inside the application class.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Is it planed by sap to develop "as in the old world" to use the text labels from the date dictionary to save time during development ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Can you provide me with the factual elements to unilaterally judge the use of an AI to substantiate your answer? I think you are a good community manager. But there are some rules when you write this kind of accusation. This is borderline defamation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
