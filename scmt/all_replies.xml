    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thanks so much for these valuable insights. Definitely very helpful.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I´m facing the situation that in our S/4 on premise we are also looking into the situation that only three XML text types are a bit too less.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Can anyone share if there is a possibility to use more than the three pre-defined types?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Santa learns lessons from the past: Successful Agentic AI needs an Event Driven Architecture</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Most organisations realise that Agentic AI will become critical to their business. But there is still hesitation about giving up more control to these new agents. What if they make bad decisions, what if they do the wrong thing ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’ve been in the technology industry for more decades than I may care to admit. Before joining SAP, I spent 14 years working within Financial Services and Capital Markets. It is interesting to reflect on those times. Many of the challenges back then remain the same today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Financial Services, the major players did not hesitate to innovate with new technology – for them it was opportunity. Very early on they realised that trading in “simpler” financial instruments ( e.g. foreign exchange ) did not really need humans shouting excitedly at one another on the (tele)phone. That trading was quickly handed over to computers – and whilst it was perhaps not AI by today’s definition, it was certainly &lt;STRONG&gt;algorithmic&lt;/STRONG&gt; and it was most definitely &lt;STRONG&gt;autonomous&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Billions still gets traded by these Agentic AI predecessors, all based on the lightning-fast decisions they make ( but operating within parameters and thresholds defined by humans that quantify the risk ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Decisions are made as a result of an event that arises. &lt;U&gt;Better&lt;/U&gt; decisions are made knowing the wider context of that event. Yes, context comes from data. Wider context ( surprise ! ) comes from more and different data. But all that data needs to be super up-to-date, and accurate.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Financial Services firms understood and solved this also. In a 24x7 global market, there is no window for a batch run to load data. Trading systems, market data providers, stock exchanges, market and credit risk systems and more, all needed to be wired together for simultaneous update of data. Plus, it needed to be robust and flexible to add-in other market participants and their systems also.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most firms adopted architectures built around messaging-oriented middleware, with technologies like Enterprise Service Bus, Message Queue, and Event Bus amongst others, all being variations on a theme that today we call an &lt;STRONG&gt;Event Driven Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt; (EDA). Their appetite for speed pushed the technology to milli-second response times and super high-availability. Equally valuable was that the decoupled publisher-subscriber model allowed much faster and easier recovery if any of the participants in their expanded trading ecosystem did experience a failure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Perhaps such requirements seem a bit extreme for many companies operating in other industry segments. But the world is increasingly real time for the majority of businesses, and as Agentic AI plays a bigger part in your daily operations, it may be time to reflect on these lessons.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To highlight this more tangibly, I thought about a festive ( but fictional ? ) example where the capabilities of an Event Driven Architecture could really make a difference. So grab a coffee, something sweet to eat ( save the gym for the New Year ) and read on …&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Santa Inc refactors gift delivery on an Event Driven Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After decades relying on delivery to every home in sequence, Santa has realised this will no longer scale and he risks missing targets and some serious reputational damage. His operations used to be ok, but the customer base expands every year and getting to all of those in one day is now stretching the imagination.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="291356_GettyImages-1283733014_medium_jpg.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353517i5E415B5FBE57E34C/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="291356_GettyImages-1283733014_medium_jpg.jpg" alt="291356_GettyImages-1283733014_medium_jpg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Production used to be straightforward when it was just teddy bears, dolls, drums and toy trains, but now with games consoles, smartphones and other sophisticated presents it has become necessary to outsource to specialised manufacturing facilities in many countries. The elves have switched roles from sewing and carpentry to now managing supply chains, delivery bottlenecks and stock-outs – they’re stressed and threatening to go on strike ! Managing stock and purchasing was much easier when children used to write letters, but now they post their wish lists on social media – and keep changing their minds based on what is trending ! Logistics was never a problem – Rudolph and the other reindeer managed through even the harshest weather. But now they are obliged to adhere to air-traffic control diversions and compulsory rest stops. Finally, when delivering a present, it was disappointing to find out &amp;nbsp;( too late ) that the child had been naughty rather than nice. It meant carrying extra payload on the sleigh and unnecessary manufacturing and purchase costs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Santa has an extensive IT landscape and ecosystem. But he realised even his magical powers were no longer the answer – &lt;STRONG&gt;it was time to transform his operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;. But not rip and replace … even with 364 quieter days, that would still be too much work. Besides, most of the individual systems did what they needed to do – it was just they didn’t really react to each other that well. There was a lot of point-to-point connection between the production, inventory, CRM and other systems, with each repeatedly polling the other for updates – a real spaghetti architecture. Adding new suppliers’ systems into this landscape was slow. Recovering from any one system failure, having to replay lost transactions and regain overall confidence in stock quantities and delivery shipments an even bigger nightmare.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All of this was putting huge pressure on the elves. Santa has always been committed to his workforce, and he wanted the team to be happy and motivated. He looked to Agentic AI to help them, to manage the scale and complexity of supply chains. But like his elves, those AI agents would need to be super-smart, reactive, and always up to date with reliable data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And then the lightbulb went on for Santa. He was reading this &lt;A href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/06/1124323/enabling-real-time-responsiveness-with-event-driven-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article&lt;/A&gt; about Event Driven Architecture and realised that would answer so many of these problems. The synchronous and repeated point-to-point communication is taken away. Instead, events are published asynchronously, with brokers distributing and guaranteeing them, to be consumed by any system that is interested – instantly ( super-fast ) and simultaneously ( not each system in turn ). The spaghetti is now replaced by something more like a giant distributed smorgasbord in which everyone ( elves, agents and ecosystem partners ) can share all at once. &lt;EM&gt;NOTE: Santa was never a fan of spaghetti but does quite enjoy a good smorgasbord.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With an Event Driven Architecture, Santa could be much more responsive in his production runs and purchasing. Plus, new suppliers could be on-boarded quickly and easily to cater for peaks in toy popularity, as well as getting up-to-date pricing and costs across his ecosystem. On the big night itself, so many of those delivery headaches could now be mitigated. Travel and weather alerts would be provided immediately for dynamic routing updates ( and for Santa, every milli-second matters ). Add to this a real-time feed of naughty-or-nice monitoring data being gathered by event brokers across the globe ( some in very remote locations ) and made available to the dynamic routing algorithm as well as stock logistics teams ( Santa has an increasing network of warehouses that he needs to stop at – he cannot carry everything on his sleigh ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Santa and his Enterprise Architect ( another Elf ) looked at options and decided on SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh. Given that 84% of the world’s global commerce runs on SAP systems, and these already have high-value business events out-of-the-box, it was likely that much of Santa’s ecosystem could be easily included. Even for those using other vendors’ applications, the solution was open to those via industry-standard protocols, plus it was possible to include custom-built events. It did not need rip and replace, and the system could scale by adding more brokers over time to create an&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;event mesh&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Even better, that same infrastructure could be used for other event use cases ( Santa wondered about moving into Travel &amp;amp; Entertainment for the rest of the year – perhaps offering trips on the sleigh into low earth orbit – he thought that might become popular ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whilst looking at SAP, his Enterprise Architect saw SAP Build &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/joule-studio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/A&gt;, to create the AI agents. That seemed an obvious choice also – many processes would run on SAP, the most relevant and up-to-date operational data resides there, plus it offered a large choice of LLMs across the major providers. Quick to get into production also – because they rapidly needed to regain morale amongst the elves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So that’s the story of how one globally recognised brand came to explore the benefits of an Event Driven Architecture. If you recognise any similarities to challenges within your own business operation, then I would invite you learn more &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/integration-suite/advanced-event-mesh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;. Or, if you would like to see an example that the elves built earlier, then please do look at this &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2025/11/f0033bb9-297f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;short demo&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

In this sixth and final part, we discuss how the everyday work of supply chain managers will change. Key technological drivers include the rapid spread of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud technologies. This is reinforced by a socioeconomic trend: a shortage of skilled workers. While the knowledge required to handle many tasks is becoming increasingly specialized, demographic developments are shrinking the available workforce. This is already leading to highly polarizing views: on one side, some fear that many workers could lose their jobs to AI; on the other, many see AI as the best hope for staying competitive and overcoming new challenges amid the emerging shortage of skilled employees.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The reality will vary by employee and company. Although reliable forecasts are difficult given the rapid pace of change, three developments are already noticeable today. First, the range of tasks in Supply Chain Management will shift from operational to strategic activities. Second, the interaction between people and technology will change significantly. Finally, education and training for the Supply Chain Managers of the future will – and must – change.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Shifting the range of tasks from operational to strategic activities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With ongoing digitalization and use of AI, manual work is already shrinking in employees’ daily routines. By 2035, many companies will automate most routine decisions across the end-to-end supply chain – from demand forecasting and purchase order processing to dynamic route planning in logistics. Time once spent on “transaction” work – collecting, cleaning, reviewing, and documenting – will shift to coordinating a system of data platforms, decision intelligence, and AI agents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This shifts the focus of tasks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From execution to design: People set objectives, guidelines, and policies for how systems act, and design the decision logic (“guardrails”) for trade-offs across price, volume, service, and sustainability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From reaction to anticipation: The focus moves to scenario planning, Digital Twin simulations, and portfolio choices (e.g., higher service level versus less capital tied up).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From KPIs to Outcomes: Move from purely operational metrics (e.g., on-time delivery at the level of individual orders) to results-focused targets such as risk-adjusted contribution margin, customer experience, resilience levels, and sustainability impact.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The day-to-day work of 2035 becomes more strategic: In the morning, the Control-Tower environment offers an overview of the situation with current risks, opportunities, and suggestions from AI agents. Employees talk with colleagues and copilots to understand the impact of different scenarios (e.g., a supplier outage on high-margin segments), adjust policies (such as safety stocks in critical regions), run experiments in the Digital Twin, and make a few exceptional but high-impact decisions. This is accompanied by new roles such as Network Orchestrator, Scenario Strategist for end-to-end decisions, and Data Steward.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Changing how people and technology work together&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on these changes, it’s clear that technology will move from being just a tool for completing tasks to being a partner working alongside people. The following focus areas are already emerging:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copilots instead of masks: natural-language, context-enabled assistants explain suggestions, simulate alternatives, and implement policy changes. Prompting shifts from ad‑hoc commands to structured briefs that state the goal, constraints, and evaluation criteria.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Explainability and uncertainty: Recommendations include clear justifications, key drivers, confidence levels, and uncertainty ranges. Explainable AI and standard why/what‑if reports become the norm to build trust and support audits.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Continuous learning: Systems learn from everyday use. Employees provide structured feedback that flows into the models and further improves the results.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As employees hand over more control and responsibility to technology, governance needs extra care. This includes using agent-on-agent controls (agents that monitor other agents) and setting clear human release criteria and approval steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The training of the supply chain managers of the future&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The described role shifts and the new form of interaction require a profound change in training and further development. The ideal supply chain manager of the future will mix deep business experience with fluency in new tools and adaptability. As one interviewee put it: “We need a person who is experienced and young. Experienced, in the sense that she knows the company and the products and stays calm when something unexpected happens. Young, in the sense that she knows all new tools and technologies and is flexible enough to adapt to new possibilities. “&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although this can be covered by a team rather than by individuals, it also suggests that T-shaped profiles will be in high demand in the future: a broad set of basic digital competencies combined with deep domain expertise. Everyone in the future supply chain should understand the end-to-end processes, identify the dependencies, optimize the network as a whole, and stay current on rapid tech advances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, we recommend that in the future training and further training be more cross-functional – with stations in purchasing, production, logistics, sales and data &amp;amp; analytics. At the same time, employees should be trained with technology-enabled learning in the context of work. This includes building learning environments where new technologies, methods, and concepts can be applied and reflected directly in the work process. The focus is less on formal training, but on the ability to experiment with digital tools, to critically question their results and to derive impulses to improve processes and decisions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion: The Supply Chain Managers of 2035&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 2035, Supply Chain Managers will spend less time on routine transactions and more on building and running complex, connected decision-making environments. Technology will act as a true team member – preparing options, executing decisions, and learning from outcomes within clear guardrails. People remain the decisive success factor: bringing sharpened strategic judgment, strong data and technology fluency, a deep sense of responsibility, and the ability to orchestrate ecosystems. Organizations that embrace this transformation now will not only become more productive and resilient but also build supply chains that deliver sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="fdiehlmann_1-1765875977633.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352552iC3158D4A824BA70F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="fdiehlmann_1-1765875977633.png" alt="fdiehlmann_1-1765875977633.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure (AI generated): The interaction between humans and technology is shifting from a focus on transactional data to dialog-based copilots.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This article was written in collaboration with Prof. Kai Hoberg (Kühne Logistics University) in the context of the SAP-KLU study "The Supply Chain of the Future.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Part 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-1-of-6/ba-p/14264307" target="_self"&gt;How&amp;nbsp;Future Supply Chain Management Works&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Part 2:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-2-of-6/ba-p/14271554" target="_self"&gt;How Data, AI, and Agents are Changing Supply Chain Planning&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Part 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-3-of-6/ba-p/14277803" target="_self"&gt;Is Artificial Intelligence Determining Future Purchasing?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Part 4:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-4-of-6/ba-p/14282736" target="_self"&gt;The Factory of the Future: Production in the Age of AI, Circular Economy, and Autonomous Systems&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Part 5:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-5-of-6/ba-p/14286716" target="_self"&gt;The New Era of Logistics: AI and Robotics in Action?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi there,&lt;BR /&gt;nearly 2,5 years passed by and it is still not possible! Today I am facing exactly the same challenge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Requirement&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I need a dynamic structure filter for prior year, based on the actual variable selection.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Ronaldo&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There is a way to get info back for a asynchronous RFC (starting new task), but the program construction to make this work may conflict with the reason why you in the first place chose to use "starting new task" - and the programming would certainly be very complicated like a&amp;nbsp;&lt;A title="Rube Goldberg machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Rube&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Goldberg&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;machine&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;You could add a call-back form to the CALL FUNCTION command and in that call-back form you could probably retrieve the spool from the asynchronous task and write the output again. Then the output would get attached to the background program.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Why did you use "starting new task" in the first place?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Kind Regards&lt;BR /&gt;Thomas Madsen Nielsen&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm working on a DataSphere implementation with 5 external non SAP ERP sources. For S4HANA Cloud the replication flows work very well. However, for the Non SAP sources most of them don't have CDC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is the best practice for incremental loading non SAP raw data without CDC enabled? Would it be creating 2 data flows for every table, 1 for a full load and 1 for the incremental load?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Differentiate free-of-charge vs standard deliveries at outbound delivery header in SAP Public Cloud</title>

    <content>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are working in an SAP Public Cloud environment and facing the following challenge in the Warehouse Monitor:&lt;BR /&gt;Outbound delivery documents use the same &lt;STRONG&gt;delivery type (LF)&lt;/STRONG&gt; for both processes – standard sales and free-of-charge deliveries. At the outbound delivery &lt;STRONG&gt;header&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we cannot find any field or criterion to differentiate these two types of deliveries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The only difference we currently see is at the &lt;STRONG&gt;item level&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where the &lt;STRONG&gt;item category&lt;/STRONG&gt; differs:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TAN&lt;/STRONG&gt; = standard sales&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CBXN&lt;/STRONG&gt; = free-of-charge delivery&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, there is no way to distinguish them at the header level, and in SAP Public Cloud there is a restriction that we cannot create a new delivery type.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Question:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Is there any way to differentiate free-of-charge deliveries from standard sales deliveries at the outbound delivery header in EWM? Can we add a &lt;STRONG&gt;custom field&lt;/STRONG&gt; or use another approach (e.g., BAdI, extensibility options)? Has anyone faced this scenario and found a solution in the Public Cloud environment?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance for your help!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

    <title>How to Show Previous Year (Same Month) Date in Dynamic Text Using Story Filter in SAP SAC</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello everyone!!!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have an SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) analytic story where a &lt;STRONG&gt;story-level date filter&lt;/STRONG&gt; (not an input control) is applied on a posting date dimension.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this story, I have two tables:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Table 1&lt;/STRONG&gt; displays data for the &lt;STRONG&gt;currently selected date&lt;/STRONG&gt; from the story filter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Table 2&lt;/STRONG&gt; displays data for the &lt;STRONG&gt;same month of the previous year&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which has already been achieved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, I need to align this logic with &lt;STRONG&gt;dynamic text boxes&lt;/STRONG&gt; placed above each table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;Table 1&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the requirement is straightforward. The dynamic text directly fetches the selected date from the story filter and displays it with a message, for example:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;“Balance Sheet as on April, 25”&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Month, YY)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;Table 2&lt;/STRONG&gt;, I need a second dynamic text box that displays the &lt;STRONG&gt;same month but previous year&lt;/STRONG&gt;, derived from the &lt;EM&gt;same story filter selection&lt;/EM&gt;. For example:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;“Balance Sheet as on April, 24”&lt;/STRONG&gt;(Month, YY)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The key constraints are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;The date selection comes from a &lt;STRONG&gt;story filter&lt;/STRONG&gt;, not an input control.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dynamic text should be driven by the &lt;STRONG&gt;same story filter selection&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I would like to understand the &lt;STRONG&gt;recommended and supported approach&lt;/STRONG&gt; in SAC to derive and display the previous year (same month) date in a dynamic text box, based on a story-level date filter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any guidance, best practices, or scripting-based solutions would be highly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Not sure, in which version you are working. Private or Public Cloud. Please note for TM integration, SAP expects the PO to trigger an inbound delivery, and the delivery carries the transportation data (route, shipping condition, loading date). If you are in S/4, SAP TM can determine the required route to an in-bound delivery being triggered from PO. On the other hand, if you want this custom validation at PO header level, then, you need to go with available BAdIs&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I am using an SAP Analytics Cloud analytic model with BW Live data. I excluded one dimension member because the cost should not be accounted and set the filter option to hide, so no titles are shown. However, a blank filter is still visible in the story filter area. Is it possible to completely hide this story filter or handle it using some other method in SAC without modifying anything in BW?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Ankit,&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;although you can define overridable fields of type Quantity and String in a price element specification it is not supported in within Subscription Billing. Only overwritable fields of type Price Condition within Subscription Billing.&lt;BR /&gt;If you want to transfer values for fields ot type Quantity or String, then you have to define this in the pricing field mapping for the pricing scheme within the Business Configuration app. In the context of a subscription item, you can use&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Custom references for fields of type String&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Product Configuration for fields of type String, Quantity and Date&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Does this meet your requirement?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Carsten&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I am using an SAP Analytics Cloud analytic model with BW Live data. Is it possible to create a speedometer or gauge style chart that visually rises from 0 to 80 million when sales in August is 80 million, so that it creates a strong visual impact instead of directly showing the value?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;It seems that when using static actions, even if we use the extension "result"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;static action XXXXX result [1..*] $self;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;it´s not possible refresh the rows after the action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using side effects with this actions in order to refresh a field returns a sintax error "Static action/function "clearSelectedEmptyStreets" is not allowed here".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;side effects { action XXXXXXXX affects field Street; }&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I don´t know if I miss something because, since my understanding, this is a common requirement: to execute an action with all the rows that fulfill a condition.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi Lakshmipathi, we are working on-premise platform application. Thanks for your input but in standard PO(NB) when you create an inbound delivery the transport data (route, shipping condition, loading date) need to enter manually in delivery since these data are not available in purchase order. But in our case, we need shipping condition and route to flow in inbound delivery from Purchase Order without any manual intervention. We also want to calculate loading date based on the route and delivery date in PO items.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please note, data archiving is used to manage data at the end of its lifecycle in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition by blocking and deleting personal data. When the end of purpose is reached, personal data is moved from the database to archive files and is implicitly marked as blocked. Blocked data is subject to access restrictions to prevent further unauthorized processing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 'Manage Archiving Variants' app, choose the archiving object and schedule archiving.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can use the archiving object &lt;STRONG&gt;SRF_TASK&lt;/STRONG&gt; for archiving reporting tasks in statutory reporting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please refer the below help document for more information,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4de200b26d5d42bbacae69c6bf6b9923/cb2ee9a6517f499299e8c03fad46e373.html?version=LATEST&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4de200b26d5d42bbacae69c6bf6b9923/cb2ee9a6517f499299e8c03fad46e373.html?version=LATEST&amp;amp;locale=en-US&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Atanu&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Support - S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Our company with more than 80 Legal Entities uses the same SF System and we were hoping the same seamless transfer for these cases as well. Could you please confirm that it is not working for the transfers across different legal entities? If so, is there any plan to improve the tool for such cases as well?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thanks in advance for any information.&lt;BR /&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Ceren&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;On the UI5 if you set the control to Mandatory then it won't enforce any checks by default. It will just put the (*) in front of the field. But you could only do this in Free style application and not in metadata driven apps.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;As on SAP S/4 HANA&amp;nbsp;≥ 2025, we are able to create http clients as Tier 1 ABAP Cloud compatible syntax. From my research, the unified approach&amp;nbsp; for ABAP syntax that can run on Public Cloud &amp;amp; on-prem systems will require we use Communication Targets. For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DATA: lo_client_proxy TYPE REF TO /iwbep/if_cp_client_proxy,
      lo_http_client  TYPE REF TO if_web_http_client,
      lo_cota         TYPE REF TO /coss/cota_internal.

lo_cota = NEW /coss/cota_internal(  ).
lo_http_client = lo_cota-&amp;gt;create_web_http_client( ).

lo_client_proxy = /iwbep/cl_cp_factory_remote=&amp;gt;create_v4_remote_proxy(
  EXPORTING
    is_proxy_model_key = VALUE #( repository_id = 'DEFAULT'
                                  proxy_model_id  = lv_proxy_model
                                  proxy_model_version = lv_model_vers )
    io_http_client             = lo_http_client
    iv_relative_service_root   = '/sap/opu/odata4/sap/....' ).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Behind the scenes, /coss/cota_internal will be created based on the ABAP version you are running. In our case, I am supporting Public Cloud &amp;amp; on-Prem 2025+.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For Public Cloud - Communication Targets require: 1) communication scenario, 2) communication arrangmement and communication system configuration. This scenario is testing correctly.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For On-Prem - Communication Targets (COTA) are automatically visible in transaction 'APPLDEST' and require an Application Destination be set-up underneath the COTA. For our purposes, we want to create the client proxy to read the local ABAP Application Server, therefore we point the application destination to our own system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AustinKloske_0-1766058991266.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353575iB664AA82195AF2B3/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="AustinKloske_0-1766058991266.png" alt="AustinKloske_0-1766058991266.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AustinKloske_1-1766059028058.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353577iC88F694FFD68A8FE/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="AustinKloske_1-1766059028058.png" alt="AustinKloske_1-1766059028058.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AustinKloske_2-1766059114974.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353578i8E0478DAB0F7CE39/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="AustinKloske_2-1766059114974.png" alt="AustinKloske_2-1766059114974.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The code above to generate client proxies, continues to work for on-prem systems but when -&amp;gt;execute( ) hits, a CSRF exception hits.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Yes you cannot activate batch valuation on standard HALB/FERT in Public Cloud. Copying them into ZHALB/ZFERT and activating batch valuation is the correct and supported approach. This aligns with SAP’s extensibility model for Public Cloud and is safe for future releases (like 2508).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

You can point your dynamic Text to Widget Filter from Filter and Variable Selection. This will work if you have Date in the filter section of the table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="N1kh1l_0-1766062971778.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353621i8B3DD332329A37DE/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="N1kh1l_0-1766062971778.png" alt="N1kh1l_0-1766062971778.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope this helps !&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nikhil&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>From the perspective of DM production process, it already supports OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion. However, I previously encountered an issue where the communication scenario from the S/4HANA side did not support OAuth 2.0 for OData APIs. Can you confirm whether the OData APIs you are currently using support OAuth 2.0?</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I assume, you're trying to do this while posting and all these places you are not getting the Document number and only getting the Year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Surely, there will be some places where you'll get the document number as well.&lt;BR /&gt;Still, I would like to propose a solution. You can create a Task to listen to the event for the BO. Events gets triggered post Commit so you'll always get the whole details. In the Task you can write the code to update the ZUONR field.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;While the most recent 2511 release of SAP Digital Manufacturing is centered on targeted improvements to stability, scalability, and everyday usability in productive environments, it also provides a good moment to pause and look back. In this blog, I am taking a retrospective view on some of the key innovations delivered with release 2508.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Below is a concise, snackable collection of the main highlights from 2508, covering the improvements across Execution, Worker Experience, Demand, Edge, Insights, and Automation areas.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Collaboration link for consolidated goods issues&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With release 2508, SAP Digital Manufacturing introduces a new collaboration link that enables consolidated goods issue (GI) posting for components at operation completion. Instead of integrating each individual component consumption, the GI is triggered once an operation is finally completed, independently of yield confirmation. This addresses scenarios where frequent or granular consumption postings would otherwise create unnecessary integration volume. This enhancement reduces ERP load, avoids redundant postings, and simplifies integration logic while still ensuring accurate material postings. It is particularly valuable for high-throughput environments where efficiency and reduced interface traffic are critical.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Execution 1.png" style="width: 816px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353027iE13336EFD49A4FBA/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Execution 1.png" alt="Execution 1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Data collection: Parameter type list&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The new List parameter type in Data Collection allows predefined values to be selected from centrally managed data field lists. Instead of free-text input, users now select valid values during data collection, ensuring consistency and correctness of captured data. This directly addresses the risk of operator input errors and inconsistent values across production records. For businesses, this improves data quality, reduces rework caused by invalid entries, and speeds up data collection on the shop floor. It also lays a more reliable foundation for downstream analytics and quality reporting.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Execution 2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353028i4CB8148001050C04/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Execution 2.png" alt="Execution 2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Data collection: Default value for parameter&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This release also enables default values for Boolean and List-type data collection parameters. During execution, parameters now automatically default to a predefined value, which operators can override only if needed. This improvement targets repetitive data entry scenarios where the same value is entered repeatedly, causing inefficiencies and operator fatigue. From a business perspective, this results in faster execution steps, improved user experience, and reduced cognitive load for operators. Over time, it helps standardize data capture while maintaining flexibility for exceptions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Execution 3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353029i555693B97C610DB0/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Execution 3.png" alt="Execution 3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inventory: New API for clearing inventory&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A new public API is introduced to clear inventory in SAP Digital Manufacturing using plant and inventory ID. The API fully clears the on-hand quantity for inventories originating from ERP, EWM, or DM itself, without triggering external integrations. This addresses inventory inconsistencies that can occur due to rounding effects or process discrepancies between systems. For businesses, the API provides a controlled way to clean up excess or incorrect inventory balances in DM, ensuring system consistency and operational transparency. It supports cleaner inventory management without manual corrections or complex reconciliation steps.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Worker Experience&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For Worker Experience area, I take a small step ahead and look at capabilities that are already available in beta today and are expected to become generally available with release 2605. These innovations give a good sense of where the shop floor user experience in SAP Digital Manufacturing is heading, with a clear focus on usability, flexibility, and support for compliance-driven scenarios.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New POD 2.0 Framework (GA in 2605)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With POD 2.0, SAP Digital Manufacturing introduces a new framework for shop floor user interfaces that focuses on performance, layout flexibility, and extensibility. The framework offers faster load times, a cleaner UI design, and a WYSIWYG-based layout approach that allows precise placement of controls and reuse of templates. This addresses longstanding pain points related to slow POD startup times, rigid layouts, and high custom development effort. From a business perspective, POD 2.0 reduces implementation and maintenance costs while improving operator efficiency on the shop floor. Its plugin-based architecture also creates a scalable foundation for future capabilities without requiring extensive redesign.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="WorkEx1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353013i38FA242B98162FF2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="WorkEx1.png" alt="WorkEx1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;New WYSIWYG Designer&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="WorkEx2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353021i5035243CE15504A6/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="WorkEx2.png" alt="WorkEx2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Design Dialogues/Pages with HTML, Labels, Simple Forms, Plugins and iFrames&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="WorkEx3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353022i9CE9595A6D2C243D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="WorkEx3.png" alt="WorkEx3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;Integrate Production Processes bi-directionally&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="WorkEx4.png" style="width: 952px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353023i4531185E0722DF60/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="WorkEx4.png" alt="WorkEx4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Use a high number of pre-configured actions to reduce custom efforts&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Electronic Batch Record (EBR) (GA in 2605)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Electronic Batch Record capability enables the creation, review, and approval of document-driven batch records directly within SAP Digital Manufacturing. It supports structured batch documentation with role-based authorization, versioning, and a comprehensive audit trail, enabling compliance-focused production scenarios. This addresses the challenge of managing batch documentation across multiple systems or through manual, paper-based processes. This way, EBR improves compliance with regulatory requirements such as GMP while reducing manual effort and documentation errors. It also establishes a consistent digital record that increases transparency, traceability, and readiness for audits.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="WorkEx5.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353024iD0965ACBFE1EAE28/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="WorkEx5.png" alt="WorkEx5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage EBRs in POD 2.0 via multiple EBR specific plugins&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="WorkEx6.png" style="width: 795px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353025i7CE57C453C8F8FB1/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="WorkEx6.png" alt="WorkEx6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;Header Data, SFCs for the batch and a seamless Activity Log w/ e-signatures&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="WorkEx7.png" style="width: 799px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353026i744D63CD3C4B67ED/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="WorkEx7.png" alt="WorkEx7.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data scan: Barcode configuration &amp;amp; execution (GA in 2605 for production process integration)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The data scan capability enables barcode-driven execution of production activities directly within the POD by configuring barcode parsing and mapping rules. Scanned barcodes can be interpreted using predefined structures and automatically trigger actions such as assembly, data collection, or SFC start, without additional manual steps. This addresses the inefficiency and error risk of manual data entry and navigation during execution. From a business standpoint, Data Scan reduces operator interaction time, accelerates production steps, and improves data accuracy on the shop floor. It also provides a scalable foundation for automation by reusing configurations across multiple execution scenarios.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="WorkEx8.png" style="width: 883px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353030iA902477E3A665242/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="WorkEx8.png" alt="WorkEx8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SFC-based scheduling in Resource Orchestration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This release introduces SFC-based scheduling within Resource Orchestration, allowing schedules to be created and adjusted at the execution-object level rather than only at order level. SFCs can be scheduled directly on resources or work centers and executed seamlessly in the POD. This addresses the limitation of coarse-grained scheduling when frequent disruptions or mid-process adjustments occur on the shop floor. Speaking from the business perspective, SFC-based scheduling enables more precise control, faster reaction to disruptions, and better alignment between planning and execution. It is especially valuable in environments with high variability or short production cycles.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Demand1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353035i96D3CDA883740899/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Demand1.png" alt="Demand1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Switching between order-based and SFC-based scheduling&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The planning board now allows planners to switch between order-based and SFC-based scheduling while maintaining consistent execution in the POD. This provides flexibility to plan at a higher level when stability is high and shift to detailed SFC scheduling when disruptions occur. This improves decision-making by allowing planners to choose the most appropriate planning granularity for the situation. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Multi-model planning board for heterogeneous objects&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 2508, the planning board is enhanced to support multiple execution object types, such as orders and SFCs, working under the same scheduling constraints. This enables heterogeneous objects to be visualized and scheduled together rather than in isolated planning contexts. The enhancement addresses scenarios where different production elements need to be coordinated on shared resources, such as in mill or continuous manufacturing industries. For businesses, this provides a more realistic and comprehensive scheduling view of the shop floor. It improves capacity utilization and reduces planning blind spots caused by fragmented scheduling models.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Demand2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353036i8BAC9318B0D062F1/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Demand2.png" alt="Demand2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Public API for reading labor skills&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A new public OData API is introduced to expose labor skill data from SAP Digital Manufacturing for external consumption. The API supports complex filtering and query structures that were previously difficult to handle through existing interfaces. This addresses the challenge of integrating skill-based scheduling or workforce analytics with external systems. For businesses, the API enables better workforce planning, advanced scheduling scenarios, and integration with third-party planning or analytics tools. It opens up skill data for broader reuse while maintaining a standardized and controlled access model.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Edge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Event-based business rules on Edge&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With release 2508, SAP Digital Manufacturing Edge introduces event-based business rules that allow production processes running on the Edge to be triggered automatically based on Edge events. A new rule type, “Edge Event,” enables business logic defined in the cloud to be deployed and executed locally on the Edge. This addresses the limitation of relying solely on cloud-based triggers in scenarios where connectivity is unstable or latency-sensitive. This supports business continuity by allowing localized, automated reactions to shop floor events. It also improves transparency through the new Monitor Event Business Rules app available directly on the Edge.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Edge1.png" style="width: 901px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353037iBC326149C0B0A231/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Edge1.png" alt="Edge1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Edge2.png" style="width: 901px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353038iE62CFF57FDA7E96F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Edge2.png" alt="Edge2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Automated triggers and production processes on Edge&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Automation on the Edge is further enhanced by allowing production processes to be triggered automatically through business rule evaluations. This enables logic-driven execution of processes directly at the Edge without manual intervention from operators. The enhancement addresses the need for faster, deterministic reactions to shop floor events, especially in decentralized manufacturing environments. For businesses, this reduces response times and manual workload on the shop floor. It also ensures that critical automation logic remains operational even when cloud connectivity is interrupted.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Edge3.png" style="width: 901px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353039i292F12D31BF604F8/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Edge3.png" alt="Edge3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Print service in Edge production processes&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Printing capabilities are now enabled directly within production processes running on the Edge. This allows documents such as labels or work instructions to be printed locally as part of an executed process step. Previously, printing often required external systems or manual workarounds, increasing complexity and error risk. For businesses, embedded print services improve process integration and reduce manual handling on the shop floor. This results in more streamlined execution flows and better alignment between digital processes and physical outputs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Edge4.png" style="width: 901px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353040iDADB64DD1F6ED983/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Edge4.png" alt="Edge4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Work instruction synchronization on Edge&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Release 2508 also extends data synchronization on the Edge to include work instructions. This ensures that the latest work instructions are available locally, even when operating in disconnected or bandwidth-constrained environments. The innovation addresses reliance on constant cloud connectivity for operator guidance. From a business standpoint, synchronized work instructions improve execution consistency and reduce the risk of operators working with outdated information. It strengthens shop floor resilience by ensuring continuity of guided execution under varying network conditions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Browser locale–based descriptions in embedded analytics&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With release 2508, SAP Digital Manufacturing enhances embedded analytics by supporting browser locale–based description fields in embedded SAP Analytics Cloud dashboards. Description for fields such as material, reason code, time element, and standard value group are now displayed in the user’s browser language, provided the descriptions are maintained accordingly. This addresses the challenge of dashboards appearing incomplete or hard to interpret in multilingual production environments, a problem especially critical for customers tracking serialized materials where clear descriptions are vital. From a business perspective, the enhancement improves clarity and usability of operational reports for globally distributed teams. It enables faster and more accurate interpretation of data without requiring separate dashboards per language.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Insights1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353042iE0B5F195D19ECE05/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Insights1.png" alt="Insights1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MDO and SFC report enhancements for improved traceability&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The SFC Report and related MDOs are enhanced with additional production and traceability details in 2508. Hold and Hold Release events are now captured with user information and comments, and non-BOM components are included in the components view of the SFC Report. This closes gaps in production traceability where key events or consumed components were previously missing. For businesses, the enhancements provide a more complete audit trail of execution and material usage. They also improve report usability, supporting better root-cause analysis, compliance checks, and operational transparency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Insights2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353043iC182DAA81282F323/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Insights2.png" alt="Insights2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Production connector and automation sequences as RESTful services&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With release 2508, SAP Digital Manufacturing introduces enhanced RESTful capabilities for shop floor integration. The Production Connector can now be enabled as a RESTful service provider, allowing machines and systems on the shop floor to interact with SAP Digital Manufacturing via REST APIs. This is especially important for equipment that does not support OPC UA but still requires triggering of automation sequences or data exchange. By providing RESTful integration, businesses gain broader connectivity, simplified integration architectures, and reduced reliance on protocol-specific solutions, offering greater flexibility for connecting legacy or third-party systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, automation sequences designed in the Design Production Processes app can now be exposed as RESTful services. Once deployed, these sequences are accessible externally using HTTP or HTTPS, with configurable access types and detailed endpoints. This enables external systems to proactively trigger automation logic, moving beyond manual processes or polling mechanisms. For organizations, these enhancements support tighter integration between shop floor automation and higher-level systems such as MES extensions or custom applications, fostering more event-driven and responsive production operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Automation1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353048iB391661DC6EE6595/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Automation1.png" alt="Automation1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage and monitor exposed automation services&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Exposed automation sequences are now centrally visible in the Manage Service Registry app, including availability status and endpoint details. If a service is disabled, the system provides clear indicators to validate connector configuration and web server activation. This transparency addresses operational challenges related to troubleshooting and service governance. From a business standpoint, it improves reliability and maintainability of automation integrations. It also reduces downtime by enabling faster identification and resolution of connectivity issues.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Automation2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353050iFD23324F79E204A3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Automation2.png" alt="Automation2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Dynamic MQTT Topic Subscription and Publishing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In 2508, MQTT integration is enhanced to support dynamic subscription and publishing to broker topics. Previously, MQTT topics had to be statically maintained, limiting flexibility in event-driven automation scenarios. The new approach allows dynamic topic handling within automatic triggers and automation sequences. For businesses, this enables more scalable and adaptable messaging architectures. It supports complex event-driven use cases while reducing configuration overhead and increasing responsiveness on the shop floor.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1767357801"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1153190901" id="toc-hId-1570844296"&gt;Summary&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Release 2508 delivered a series of focused innovations that strengthened execution, planning flexibility, and automation across the digital shop floor. While 2511 builds on this progress with a strong emphasis on stability and scalability, the capabilities introduced in 2508 continue to shape how manufacturers operate and integrate their production environments today. Looking back at these highlights shows how steady, purpose-driven innovation lays the groundwork for long-term operational excellence.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":movie_camera:"&gt;🎥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Would you like to dive deeper into the innovations presented above?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Check out the recordings of our What's new sessions on&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/3582337/lp/5041602/sap-digital-manufacturing-whats-new-2508-dispatching-execution" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Dispatching &amp;amp; Execution&lt;/A&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/3582337/lp/5041217/sap-digital-manufacturing-whats-new-2508-insights-automation-business-continuity" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Insights, Automation &amp;amp; Business Continuity&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-956677396" id="toc-hId-1374330791"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More resources&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/digital-manufacturing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Digital Manufacturing | SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-digital-manufacturing" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Digital Manufacturing | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?range=CURRENT-LAST&amp;amp;PRODUCT=73555000100800001492#Q4%202025" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Roadmap Explorer for SAP Digital Manufacturing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We have implemented the logic to directly perform CRUD operations by calling API_BUSINESS_PARTNER within the RAP actions. Although the implementation was challenging, it is working as expected. SAP has also confirmed that, at present, there is no alternative solution to update custom fields on Business Partner master data other than using API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Milan,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The choice of the event type is often a complicated discussion and requires deliberate choices depending on a wide range of parameters like security needs, volume of events, decoupling requirements etc. If you are interested, I have a blog on this topic over here :&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/events-schemas-payload-101-backbone-eda-systems-hari-rangarajan-qtcpe/?trackingId=AUvMxT6tQACjJrpRoVBiYA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/events-schemas-payload-101-backbone-eda-systems-hari-rangarajan-qtcpe/?trackingId=AUvMxT6tQACjJrpRoVBiYA%3D%3D&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While a lot of SAP standard objects do contain just an object id and some other basic properties (Notification events) and you do have to query SAP for the detailed data, this is changing as there are an increasing number of events with larger payloads (State transfer events) . For example : &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/event/CE_SALESBILLOFMATERIALEVENTS/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://api.sap.com/event/CE_SALESBILLOFMATERIALEVENTS/overview&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But with respect to your specific situation where there are lot of consumers which need to query SAP for the data, there are some alternatives like the Event Add-on for AEM (&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-integration-suite/event-add-on-for-erp-advanced-event-mesh/connect-advanced-event-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-integration-suite/event-add-on-for-erp-advanced-event-mesh/connect-advanced-event-mesh&lt;/A&gt;) which can help you generate custom payloads depending on your requirement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Other options would be RAP : &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/rap-business-events-with-advanced-event-mesh-1-connecting-aem-to-s-4hana-on/ba-p/13913581" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/rap-business-events-with-advanced-event-mesh-1-connecting-aem-to-s-4hana-on/ba-p/13913581&lt;/A&gt; or AIF :&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/a-natural-choice-sap-aif-can-now-expose-events-to-advanced-event-mesh-to/ba-p/13773758" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/a-natural-choice-sap-aif-can-now-expose-events-to-advanced-event-mesh-to/ba-p/13773758&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope this helps you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hari&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've been wondering about that message, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is a community post about the upcoming changes for SAP UID:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-architecture-blog-posts/navigating-the-future-understanding-upcoming-changes-to-sap-universal-id/bc-p/14206044" target="_self"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-architecture-blog-posts/navigating-the-future-understanding-upcoming-changes-to-sap-universal-id/bc-p/14206044&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sometime in the last few years, we needed to setup the UID and link it to our S-user and email address. Right now, you can use the email address linked to your UID and S-user for login to SAP services, but you could also use the UID in some areas. So it looks like from the end of January 2026 onwards the only way to log in to the SAP services will be the registered and already connected email address plus current password.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Essentially, if you are already using the email for login and your password is current, you can continue using that.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So this will only be a problem if you have a UID that is not yet connected to a valid email address.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Cell merging is only performed if left part of the complete key is identical. If a previous columns are different, following cells that share the same value are not merged.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In your example, the value of the CON key is different, so the identical FLDATE values that follow are not merged.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Regarding the callback form, it does not allow &lt;STRONG&gt;CALL TRANSACTION&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;SUBMIT&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as both cause a dump.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Teams,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm using the check box macro in a recording that I'm editing in Producer. When the action for checkbox is inserted and I play the demo to test, the checkbox deselects in the playback. How do I change the setting for the checkbox to be selected instead of deselected in the playback/demo/practice? This is the option to insert an action/macro and then check box is selected.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;DIV&gt;We resolved this error by navigating in CBC to &lt;STRONG&gt;Logistics → Transportation and Warehousing → Transportation Management → Freight Cost Settlement → Integration to Financial Accounting → Assign Default Plant for Company Code&lt;/STRONG&gt; and setting a plant as the default. After assigning the default plant, the error was resolved.&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

Note that  the commitment amount could be different in PR and PO, because the valuation price in PR and price in PO could be different only the converted part of the PR will be considered. After the conversion, PR could still have open commitment, if not all pieces of the PR have been converted to PO.  Kindly check whether there are &amp;quot;open quantity&amp;quot; under the PR item - Quantity and Date tab.

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1896472327"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s time to simplify integration processes between Agentic SDKs and SAP ECC &amp;amp; S/4HANA systems. We’d like to introduce an ABAP add-on that brings an MCP Server directly into your SAP ERP system and supports SAP ABAP releases down to 7.01.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sounds attractive? Then let’s take a look at the architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1699958822"&gt;Architecture&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The architecture is simple. We kept in mind that you may want to avoid middleware (such as SAP BTP applications or similar solutions) while retaining full control over:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tool descriptions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;These are essential for AI orchestration–friendly tool definitions. Standard SAP descriptions of services, tables, or other ABAP objects are not sufficient to build scalable Business AI solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data provisioning&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;We provide a simple mechanism that allows you to nominate Tables, Views, and CDS Views to provision data to an Agentic SDK.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create / Update / Delete tool onboarding&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;We offer an easy mechanism to develop ABAP classes for create, update, and delete actions. Each tool requires only one method for the action and one method for metadata description.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is how you can integrate it into any Agentic SDK:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Skybuffer AI_MCP Server from ABAP_Pic01.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353679iA455EFCAC184B044/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Skybuffer AI_MCP Server from ABAP_Pic01.png" alt="Skybuffer AI_MCP Server from ABAP_Pic01.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Pic. 1.

Each object is automatically converted into a tool by the MCP Server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Skybuffer AI_MCP Server from ABAP_Pic02.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353680iB7ECCAAC6FF6A17F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Skybuffer AI_MCP Server from ABAP_Pic02.png" alt="Skybuffer AI_MCP Server from ABAP_Pic02.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Pic. 2.

Here is an example of MCP Server consumption in ChatGPT.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The MCP Server can be connected either directly via an SICF node or through the SAP Cloud Connector.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Skybuffer AI_MCP Server from ABAP_Pic04.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353682iA56515660B62E4B0/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Skybuffer AI_MCP Server from ABAP_Pic04.png" alt="Skybuffer AI_MCP Server from ABAP_Pic04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Pic. 4.

You can provide high-quality tool descriptions, fully control display tool provisioning, and easily onboard create, update, and delete tools without the need to build OData services on top of them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The solution works with any Agentic SDK and is ready for enterprise deployment as an ABAP add-on.&lt;/P&gt;</content>
