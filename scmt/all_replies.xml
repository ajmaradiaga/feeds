    <content>&lt;P&gt;I have a scenario where i am connecting iFlow in CI to AEM via the AdvancedEventMesh adapter and as per the current design, i need to retry a failed message a few times (intermittent connectivity issue) before moving the message to a Dead message queue (DMQ) in AEM. My question here is&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;How do i access the message from DMQ later and move it to the original queue for my iFlow to reprocess the message towards the target system?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Should I create a separate queue for DMQ in the Broker manager?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How do i make sure the retry process doesn't go on a loop if the message i retry from the DMQ doesn't get delivered to the target?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s been a long time since my last blog—so long, in fact, that I can’t even remember it. As an ABAP developer with more years of experience than I care to admit, I find the new SAP environment for developers can be, well, overwhelming. You start learning one thing, only to discover you should have learned something else first, and then something before that… and before you know it, you’re not sure where you started or where you’re supposed to end up.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At least, that’s how I felt—especially because I’m learning on my own, without any external help, and my colleagues and I are taking the bumpy route.. We’ve just finished converting the systems, and soon we’ll have a flood of requests for apps and new features—while, of course, all the other projects keep rolling along like a runaway train.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, I intend to create a series of posts to share my knowledge (whenever I have some time to write here) - because I got a lot of help from other people on the community but it was not easy to put it all together and that’s what I will try to do. I want to share what I’ve learned, and also let you know: it’s not just you!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are my tips—hope they help (or at least make you laugh):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Don’t get too hung up on the names. Just try stuff. Start small!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;I made a front-end app with no database access, and it helped me learn about MVC (&lt;SPAN&gt;Model-View-Controller scheme&lt;/SPAN&gt;) and all those new buzzwords. In plain English: I used the Fiori Dev Space on Business Application Studio (the place you code apps), made a simple screen to compute data, and that was that. I had to learn about views and controllers just to do this basic thing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Make analogies to what you know.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;When you learn a new language, you try to find something similar in your native tongue to make sense of it. People say not to do that, but let’s be honest—your brain craves comfort. “Oh, this is like that? Great!” After a while, you’ll get the nuances. For me, Views are like START-OF-SELECTION, Controllers are like AT SELECTION SCREEN and the logic is. Controller control the view. Is the comparison exactly the same? Nope. But it made me comfortable enough to move on.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;And GIT&lt;/STRONG&gt;… I was lucky to have used versioning tools when I start working with SAP, so it wasn’t totally new to me. Think of it like ABAP requests and tasks: you finish something, release it to test, and that’s a version. Then you release the full request. (Keep in mind, GIT is way more complex than that!) But that analogy helped me wrap my head around it.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adventures in BTP, GitLab, Git hub and permissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Now, let me tell you about my adventure with BTP, GitLab, and all those things I had (and still have) no clue most of it. I spent—no joke—almost three days trying to commit my app to GitLab, only to learn we actually use GitHub. Please, laugh at my pain. If my suffering brings joy to the world, it was worth it. Then I had to learn how to unlink GitLab, spent more days connecting to GitLab, only to discover I was missing permission to create a folder in my blank repository! I tried 100 commands, and only ONE finally told me it was a permission issue. Please, enjoy that suffering too. Eventually, I got the permission, typed the magic command, and—voilà!—it worked. I almost cried tears of joy. Always check your permissions! And remember, the start is hard—I’m still at the start—but learning this way, while painful, means you really learn. No one’s holding your hand, but you’ll come out stronger (and with better stories).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Make notes on everything you try, even if it doesn’t work.&lt;/STRONG&gt; You never know when that random thing you checked will save your future self.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use AI, but don’t rely on it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Use AI, but don’t rely on it. I use Co-pilot and have access to Joule (thanks to a SAP POC), and AI can be a lifesaver… but it also broke my simple app three times, forcing me to start over. At one point, AI was more lost than I was and started suggesting things that made me question reality. So, use AI, but keep your wits about you.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;First things first—GIT!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;And here’s the last tip: First things first—GIT! If I’d focused on git (hub or lab, doesn’t matter), I could have saved the working version of my app, then gone wild with changes. If I messed up beyond repair (which, let’s be honest, happens), I could just roll back and start again from where it was working last.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;And the most important tip: Don’t give up.&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/U&gt;I thought about it, not gonna lie. But learning is awesome, and the feeling you get when you finally succeed is unbeatable.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;What about you? How does it feel to move from ABAP to fullstack SAP development (or whatever they call it now, they change it so often).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's share tips and feelings. I know I'm not the only one.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Andréa&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hello &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2035121"&gt;@Chris1973&lt;/a&gt;, Hello When preparing G/L Accounts' mapping for JPK_KR_PD's configuration with my polish customer some more business cases were raised : 1/ Some journal entries refer to revenues/costs from both related and unrelated parties. Therefore the G/L Account can be assigned "RPAI_RKAI_POZ" as Financial Tag Report and "RPAI_RKAI_POW" as Alternative Financial Report Tag. The question is : how will the system differentiate those two kind of entries ? It seems that in a "standard polish solution", separate accounts would exist for related and unrelated parties, which is not the case in our system/chart of account configuration. What is the best practice in SAP S4 Hana Cloud Public 2/ Similarly, various tax tags can be assigned to a particular G/L account. Does this mean it is necessary to create as many entries in the mapping table as there are different combinations of G/L account, financial tag, and income tax tag?</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In our previous posts, we explored individual building blocks and their sophisticated capabilities. Now it's time to see how these building blocks come together in predefined layouts called standard floorplans delivered by SAP Fiori elements for OData V4. The SAP Fiori development portal not only showcases these proven layouts but also reveals the rich set of extension options available to customize them for your specific business needs. Let's explore how you can leverage standard floorplans while maintaining the flexibility to extend when necessary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1765457780"&gt;Understanding Standard Floorplans&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard floorplans are predefined layouts of building blocks provided to enable efficient SAP Fiori elements application development. These floorplans inherit all the qualities of their building blocks while adding optimizations for component interaction at the floorplan level. Think of them as proven blueprints that combine the building blocks we explored in previous posts into coherent, user-friendly experiences.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the portal's section for &lt;A href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/topic/floorplans" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Standard Floorplans&lt;/A&gt; we demonstrate why this is the most efficient approach for building your SAP Fiori elements application. These layouts represent years of UX research, customer feedback, and real-world usage patterns. When your requirements align closely with a standard floorplan, you get enterprise ready functionality with minimal development effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="The list report – object page layouts are the most common floorplans in SAP Fiori elements" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341881iD47B53BBA9F416FC/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="marcel_waechter_5-1763376268405.png" alt="The list report – object page layouts are the most common floorplans in SAP Fiori elements" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;The list report – object page layouts are the most common floorplans in SAP Fiori elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="marcel_waechter_7-1763376349704.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341883iF5C8BDEDA6F322A8/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="marcel_waechter_7-1763376349704.png" alt="marcel_waechter_7-1763376349704.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1568944275"&gt;Exploring Floorplans in the Portal&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The portal showcases different types of standard floorplans, each optimized for specific use cases:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;List Report Page - The classic combination of filter bar and table for comprehensive data exploration and management&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Worklist - A streamlined version focusing purely on the table when filtering isn't the primary concern&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Analytical List Page – An enhanced version with visual filters and charts for data analysis and insights&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Overview Page - Visual card-based interface for quick access to vital business information and immediate action&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Object Page - Comprehensive detail views with headers, forms, tables, charts, and draft-enabled editing capabilities for seamless document management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;What's important to understand is that all these floorplans make use of the same building blocks we explored in our previous posts – like the table, chart, field, and filter bar components. The difference lies in how these building blocks are orchestrated and optimized to work together at the page level.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1372430770"&gt;Extensions: When Standard Isn't Enough&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every standard floorplan provides extension points, and the portal's Extensions chapter is where you discover how to customize these proven layouts for your unique requirements. Let's look at a practical example that demonstrates both the power and philosophy of the extensibility that SAP Fiori elements for OData V4 offers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the &lt;A href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/topic/floorplanObjectPage/customSection" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Custom Section&lt;/A&gt; example, you'll see how to add a custom FlightMap section to an Object Page. This FlightMap control from SAPUI5 isn't natively supported by SAP Fiori elements, yet it integrates seamlessly into the standard floorplan structure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Custom Section in Object Page" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341870i82A4131B03C1124E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="marcel_waechter_0-1763375914063.png" alt="Custom Section in Object Page" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Custom Section in Object Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This example beautifully illustrates a key principle: your SAP Fiori elements application is never locked in. When you need functionality that goes beyond standard building blocks, you can extend the framework while retaining all the enterprise-grade features of the underlying floorplan.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However - and this is crucial - whenever functionality can be implemented using native SAP Fiori elements support (like adding a table or chart through annotations), it should be implemented that way. The closer your application stays to standard SAP Fiori elements patterns, the better your UI consistency, and the less development and maintenance effort you'll require over time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175917265"&gt;Global Patterns: The Invisible Foundation&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Don't overlook the Global Patterns chapter in the portal. These non-visual building blocks provide the enterprise-grade foundation that makes SAP Fiori applications truly business-ready, like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Draft Handling - Seamless save and restore functionality&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Routing and Navigation - Consistent navigation patterns across your application&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Side Effects - Automatic field updates triggered by user interactions, maintaining data consistency across the UI&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These global patterns are automatically used by standard floorplans, providing the robust foundation that users expect from SAP applications. Like their visual counterparts, they support extensions when your business logic requires custom behavior.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-979403760"&gt;TypeScript Support: Modern Development Made Easy&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The portal provides the code examples in TypeScript, reflecting the modern development practices we recommend for SAP Fiori elements applications. Take the &lt;A href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/controllerExtensions/editFlow" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Draft Handling&lt;/A&gt; page as an example. When you click "Show Code" next to "Implementing a Hook," you'll see TypeScript implementations that leverage our new BaseControllerExtension types.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Type Script Example in Fiori Development Portal" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341871i51C42EFE538C5CEC/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="marcel_waechter_1-1763375968162.png" alt="Type Script Example in Fiori Development Portal" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Type Script Example in Fiori Development Portal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These new types make it significantly easier to implement hooks in TypeScript, providing better IntelliSense, type safety, and development experience. The portal even includes live transpiling in the browser, so you can see the immediate effects of your code changes. Try this yourself by changing the line:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;return this.openDialog("Do you want to edit this travel request?", true);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;return this.openDialog("Do you really want to edit this travel request?", true);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click the Edit button in the sample preview, and you'll see your modified dialog text appear immediately.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Updated Sample" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341876iC541AFF11ABB24DA/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="marcel_waechter_2-1763376073370.png" alt="Updated Sample" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Updated Sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This interactive learning approach helps you understand not just what's possible, but how your changes affect the user experience in real-time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-782890255"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Fiori development portal proves to be an invaluable resource for exploring standard floorplans and understanding their extension capabilities. Whether you're building a straightforward List Report or a complex Object Page with custom sections, the portal guides you through the possibilities while helping you make informed decisions about when to use standard functionality versus custom extensions. The beauty of SAP Fiori elements lies in this balance: start with proven, enterprise-ready standard floorplans, then extend precisely where your business requirements demand it. The portal ensures you understand both the power of the standards and the flexibility of the extensions, enabling you to build applications that are both efficient to develop and maintain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-586376750"&gt;What's Next&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our next post, "Prepare building custom pages by using SAP Fiori development portal (5 of 6)," we'll explore how to move beyond standard floorplans entirely. We'll show you how the portal guides you through creating completely custom page layouts using the same building blocks, giving you maximum creative freedom while retaining all the enterprise-grade features that make SAP Fiori elements applications so powerful.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To get the full overview about the SAP Fiori development portal, check out the following blog posts of the mini-series:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-the-sap-fiori-development-portal-your-gateway-to-rapid-sap/ba-p/14236768" target="_blank"&gt;Introducing the SAP Fiori Development Portal: Your Gateway to Rapid SAP Fiori App Creation (1 of 6)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/get-familiar-with-sap-fiori-development-portal-and-the-power-of-the/ba-p/14240041" target="_self"&gt;Get familiar with SAP Fiori development portal and the power of the building blocks (2 of 6)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/explore-the-potential-of-sap-fiori-development-portal-using-complex/ba-p/14257622" target="_self"&gt;Explore the potential of SAP Fiori development portal using complex building blocks (3 of 6)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use SAP Fiori development portal to understand extension options for standard floorplans (4 of 6)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Prepare building custom pages by using SAP Fiori development portal (5 of 6)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Bringing the SAP Fiori development portal and its use to the next level (6 of 6)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <content>Hello &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2035121"&gt;@Chris1973&lt;/a&gt;, When preparing G/L Accounts' mapping for JPK_KR_PD's configuration with my polish customer some more business cases were raised : 1/ Some journal entries refer to revenues/costs from both related and unrelated parties. Therefore the G/L Account can be assigned "RPAI_RKAI_POZ" as Financial Tag Report and "RPAI_RKAI_POW" as Alternative Financial Report Tag. The question is : how will the system differentiate those two kind of entries ? It seems that in a "standard polish solution", separate accounts would exist for related and unrelated parties, which is not the case in our system/chart of account configuration. What is the best practice in SAP S4 Hana Cloud Public 2/ Similarly, various tax tags can be assigned to a particular G/L account. Does this mean it is necessary to create as many entries in the mapping table as there are different combinations of G/L account, financial tag, and income tax tag? Thank you, Erwan</content>

    <content>Thanks Cris for your response. As suggested, we had to restrict the records in Cloud Integration. But on the AEM side, we created a variable in the topic address and added enumerations specific to Account group. The topic subscriptions were adjusted accordingly to only consider the allowed values and others would be neglected without passing it on the target system.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the current information provided, it's challenging to pinpoint the issue in your replication execution. To gain more insight, I recommend reviewing transaction ST22 to determine why the "Program condition violated" error was generated. This should help you identify the root cause of the problem.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best Regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Giorgio&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3" color="#000000"&gt;Hi all,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3" color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I’m facing an issue when transferring service tickets tenant-to-tenant, specifically with migrating the email body text.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3" color="#000000"&gt;Using DWB, I’m able to export and import most of the Email object data, such as subjects, senders, and recipients without any problems. However, the email body cannot be migrated through the standard &lt;EM&gt;Email&lt;/EM&gt; object in DWB.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3" color="#000000"&gt;I exported the email body text separately via &lt;STRONG&gt;DWB &amp;gt; Export &amp;gt; Activity Notes &amp;gt; Activity&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but I’m unable to map these texts to the corresponding Email records in the new tenant.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3" color="#000000"&gt;How can I correctly migrate and map the email body from one tenant to another?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is also worth to mention that new filtering field must be defined in BD95 first. Otherwise it cannot be used - "Inconsistency in filter" error message.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks&amp;nbsp;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1398143" target="_self"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Krithik&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;for your useful post!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

The notification is sent no matter which processing channel or system was used, for example, any service, any app, any follow-on processes (such as changes of the billing status or delivery status triggered by billing or delivery documents), and so on.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The processing notification contains detailed information about single fields in a sales order. It is triggered whenever a change occurs.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

They only work when the original invoice already contains withholding tax information. So, basically, they don’t add WHT to invoice at the time you post or even if you later update th BP WHT status.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The notable difference is recreating WHT with 0% is used to rebuild WHT on documents you have posted with WHT type but 0% rate, whilst adjusting to relevant type updates WHT info when the determination logic changes but only if the document already has WHT type.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Conclusion matches your test outcomes of neither job producing results because the invoice had no WHT at all.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hope this provides the desired clarification. Let me know if you have further questions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;As part of our September 2025 release, we are excited to introduce a major innovation in &lt;STRONG&gt;Analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt; across &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Sales &amp;amp; Service Cloud V2&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Enterprise Service Management &lt;/STRONG&gt;solutions: &lt;STRONG&gt;Intent-Based Navigation&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This new capability enhances the way business users move from insight to action by seamlessly connecting embedded analytics with operational user interfaces.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A More Intuitive Path From Story to Action&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Intent-Based Navigation allows business users to jump directly from an &lt;STRONG&gt;Embedded SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) story&lt;/STRONG&gt; to the corresponding UI instance of a business entity. With a couple of clicks, users can transition from analytical context to the exact object instance they need to review or update—streamlining workflows and improving decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is important to note that this capability is designed &lt;STRONG&gt;specifically for business users consuming embedded stories&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Stories opened through the &lt;STRONG&gt;Design Stories&lt;/STRONG&gt; environment for analytics administrators will not have this feature.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For full technical details, you can explore the feature in our online Help documentation here -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/CX_NG_SALES/ea5ff8b9460a43cb8765a3c07d3421fe/0b8c99cff1604ede87f109026d018344.html#loio476fee7e5d5d434194f3a7f30ddc86d2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/CX_NG_SALES/ea5ff8b9460a43cb8765a3c07d3421fe/0b8c99cff1604ede87f109026d018344.html#loio476fee7e5d5d434194f3a7f30ddc86d2&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A short demo is also available showcasing the experience end-to-end here -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_f0xp7m42" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_f0xp7m42&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Behavior: Navigation Works on Key Fields&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As demonstrated in the demo, navigation is available only for &lt;STRONG&gt;key fields&lt;/STRONG&gt; such as &lt;EM&gt;ID&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;Display ID&lt;/EM&gt;. Because the feature is intended to take users to a specific object instance, non-key fields—such as dates, statuses, and other descriptive attributes—do not enable the &lt;STRONG&gt;Jump-To&lt;/STRONG&gt; option.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s Coming Next&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are actively working on extending navigation capabilities. Upcoming enhancements will include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigating from an Embedded SAC story to another SAC story&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Jumping from non-key fields to a filtered&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;List&lt;/STRONG&gt; UI of the corresponding business entity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These additions will further enrich cross-application navigation and analytical usability in future releases.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Create the DB again and go to repository manager and click create repo. Then restart your server . Now your repo will be connected to DB again.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then go to the Ips in sap bods to access cmc then go to data services and select the repo that you want to delete by right clicking on top of the repo name.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even without recreating the db also we can delete it through ips when the repo is inactive.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear SAP Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am facing a technical challenge regarding the reliable extraction of the &lt;STRONG&gt;Export/Legal Control status&lt;/STRONG&gt; from Sales Order Items into BW.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our business requirement is to report on the exact status that is checked during Legal Control and which determines if the item can proceed to delivery :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;VA03 =&amp;gt; Export Licence =&amp;gt; Log =&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;"Green Light" or "Red Light" status by item&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is the best practice for extracting this System Status information for a large volume of Sales Order Items into BW&amp;nbsp;in a reliable and performance-friendly way (especially considering Delta extraction)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any insights, function module examples, or experience with the specific statuses would be highly appreciated!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you in advance for your help!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Franck&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there any way to default the start time and end time when requesting a certain type of attendance so that they are always the start time of the work schedule and the end time of the work schedule, respectively? I tried creating a rule to set this based on the the functions&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Get Start Time Of Working Days() and Get End Time Of Working Days(), and attached the rule to the employee time object in the time type field, and also tried adding a rule in the time sheet entry object to set the start time and end time there based on what I set previously in the employee time object start time and end time (I was thinking maybe because the fields are transient they're not getting picked up), but no effect as per the rule trace.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Any thoughts on this please? It seems like a very straightforward requirement but somehow it doesn't seem to work.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Iulia&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Nowadays, governments around the world are facing substantial challenges. Budget constraints arising from macroeconomic shocks and geopolitical conditions demand cost efficiency from the government back office (finance, HR, procurement, etc.), while citizens are raising their expectations for highly agile, trustworthy, and effective services.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;This is where SAP Business Artificial Intelligence (SAP Business AI) steps in. It encompasses all the latest AI technologies, such as Machine Learning (ML), Generative AI, AI Copilots and most recently AI agents, ensuring the public sector can meet these ever-growing demands.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Business AI completely redefines the way governments are operating their business system – it offers one single SAP Joule copilot that serves as an embedded digital assistant&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;. In the daily work of public sector employees, Joule navigates their system landscapes, answers questions, prepares data call outs, and executes transactions. Joule Copilot is deeply embedded in the context of your data and works across all departments and applications.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;This year, SAP Joule is evolving from a simple AI copilot to being powered by AI Agents. It will continue to utilize ML and Generative AI skills but at the same time it has advanced its intelligence at an unprecedented scale. Embedded in Joule and the broader SAP Business AI portfolio, AI agents offer a new level of task execution autonomy, helping governments optimize their resources across their systems in the most efficient way.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Agents don't just perform tasks faster—they possess near-human intelligence, allowing them to boost productivity for government services, offer personalization, and provide 24/7 resolution support.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In this blog, we will delve into what SAP Agentic AI means for the public sector and share some concrete use case examples.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5" color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agentic AI for Governments – The Edge over GenAI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;So, how Agentic AI works? It begins with Large Language Models (LLMs). Trained on the vast amount of data these models are able to provide relevant suggestions to a broad set of questions – we call it Generative AI (GenAI). &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;AI Agents leverage more advanced LLMs called Reasoning Language Models (RLM), that are enhanced with the ability to reason. This gives them an opportunity to not only answer questions but solve complex tasks. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;When handling a problem, an agent first breaks it down into smaller, more manageable chunks, solves each one, and finally combines the results into a complete and accurate solution.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Unlike a GenAI-powered copilot, which needs a human to tell it what to do before acting, agentic AI can make its own decisions and act proactively. This thinking capability enables four main core abilities: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;planning, tool usage,&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt; reflection,&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;and &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;collaboration&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Let’s look at these properties by picking up an example of a typical task public sector authorities are regularly dealing with – answering citizen queries about their citizenship application status. We will see the extra benefits agents can provide when compared to GenAI assistants.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="99.92792792792793%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="78px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%" height="78px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How a Gen-AI Copilot would handle a citizenship process &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%" height="78px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How an AI Agent would handle a citizenship process&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="250px"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Planning&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%" height="250px"&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;GenAI Copilot don´t plan resolution steps to answer their request; it only follow the instructions received from the user. Its ability to assist would be limited to answering direct questions asked by the applicant who is executing the plan and actions by himself. These questions would be usually limited to understanding passport renewal application process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;The AI Agent plans a series of steps with a concrete plan to achieve by itself the given task from the request. It therefore goes beyond just answering questions about the process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;While it is true that before applying citizens are learning about their next steps, when they are waiting for a decision, they typically reach out with specific concerns that they want to resolve – for example “My process is taking longer than the time mentioned in the service description – can you address this?”. Unlike GenAI Copilot, AI Agents can assist in solving highly complex issues.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Tool usage&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;The GenAI Copilot can access information through tools but cannot execute actions with them. It does not perform tasks in the system; it only provides information based on what it sees. If an applicant is complaining about the process delay, GenAI Copilot would likely be helpful in double checking the process policy and confirming the waiting time has exceeded the regulated one. It can also be helpful in listing the contacts to reach out to. But it won’t progress further than this.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;An agent has a unique ability to reach out to connected tools to carry out the resolution plan. It can choose the tools on its own, use them to consult information, but also to execute actions directly in the system. These tools include databases, software, internet search, a calculator, and more. This helps it to not only advise on the best next actions but execute them.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;In our example, by using APIs and database access, an agent can fetch the right application data, create a dispute ticket, describe an issue, assign it to the right human responsible, and send a confirmation to the applicant.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Collaboration&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;The GenAI Copilot does not consult other collaborators in real time while executing its tasks. It follows the instructions it received and responds to requests based on its own knowledge.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;Agents are enjoying teamwork. The AI Agents can call for help when they need it. They can ask a human during their task to supervise some of their actions or request clarifications.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;They can also ask for a helping hand from other specialized AI agents to carry out specific tasks that require specialized knowledge. By collaborating together, multi-agent systems are even more effective at solving problems.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;In our case, this collaboration ability is crucial. Only human processors responsible for a citizenship case can decide on the final resolution decision. So, our agent will involve them in the review of all critical steps made in the resolution process and will ask them to define the final decisions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;When specific rules apply, it will ask a Rule-specialized Agent to provide it with the right guidance and knowledge to tackle its task.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Reflection&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;The GenAI Copilot mainly produces text output without genuine self-evaluation. It does not review the results it produces. The quality of its output can improve only if the user refines their prompt (prompt engineering) or if the underlying LLMs receive additional training.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.2972972972973%" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;The AI Agent will do its best to achieve its goal. As soon as it encounters an obstacle or is at the end of a processus, it will self-evaluate to see if it meets the desired output, then corrects itself, and explores multiple paths until the goal is reached. It learns by itself from his experience to get better next time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Returning to our citizen process case, it means that in case an agent won’t be able to find the applicant data in one database, it will check another one. It will learn next time where it can find all the necessary information the quickest.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;For public sector agencies the shift from GenAI towards AI agents translates in two major benefits:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Higher efficiency and cost reduction&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: unlike GenAI that automates single content related tasks, agents can take care of complete business processes with more proactiveness and intelligence speeding up large government operations.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Higher effectiveness and autonomy:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; applied in critical areas, advanced agents empower governments to act continuously - even outside of normal hours and will with limited human supervision - extending citizen support and increasing preparedness in disaster and response management.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Those benefits will span across the whole organization—from front‑office touchpoints to back‑office department— bringing public sector entities to their next level.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Agentic AI Drives Efficiency in the Government Back Office&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Like any other organization, a public sector agency needs to be efficient in running its operational processes. Those include procuring goods and services, hiring and training employees, and of course, planning and managing public finances. Back-office tasks involve a lot of repetitive tasks, such as record-keeping, document management, transaction processing, and much more. They often rely on manual workflows that can be time-consuming, error-prone, and non-transparent.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;But the biggest challenge the governments are facing in their back-office operations is not being able to scale during periods of unprecedented workload. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Starting from the end of 2024, SAP Joule has been successfully helping governments to leverage GenAI to reduce the operational burden and improve resilience.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Applied right at the center of government finance, S/4HANA Public Sector Management, Joule is already assisting with many content-related tasks such as answering questions about key financial processes in SAP systems, understanding main financial objects and entities and navigating users through SAP applications.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;All of it leads to 95% improvement in the speed of learning, search and navigation – from 5 minutes usually spent on these tasks to just 30 seconds!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2025/04/e22c2417-ff7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="nicolasmasq_0-1763368706674.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341787i398A640258BA9321/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="nicolasmasq_0-1763368706674.png" alt="nicolasmasq_0-1763368706674.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;Learn more about Joule for SAP Public Sector Management&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Introducing Agentic AI with Joule, let’s explore how innovation can further drive operational excellence and in the back office.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Agents are now able to support tasks of a much higher complexity. In the finance domain, this would mean not only content support and navigation, but the execution of financial transactions themselves. An example of a financial transaction is a budget transfer. Let’s explore the ways an agent will be able to support.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Let’s imagine a team manager is considering an extensive overseas business trip. She has a cost estimate but is not sure if she needs special approval from her department director. With the help of document grounding, &lt;STRONG&gt;a budget agent&lt;/STRONG&gt; can analyze the travel policy of her agency and confirm her estimate is within the threshold, which means she can go ahead with flight and hotel booking without any extra approvals.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;She is then able to reserve some budget. As she is also the cost center responsible for her team, a budget agent is permitting her to look at the available funds. It pulls the overall cost center budget for the year and informs her about the remaining funds. She quickly notices that her business trip estimate is slightly exceeding the travel funds available. She asks the agent to reallocate some funds from the Team Activities budget bucket to the Travel bucket.

Let’s look at one very recent customer example using near Agentic AI technology —an advanced, GenAI‑powered, context‑aware automation system— that demonstrate the potential impact that Agentic AI can have in back-office processes.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The city of Antibes in south of France is not only efficient in its public finance but also is making sure its spending is contributing to making Antibes sustainable and eco-friendly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="nicolasmasq_5-1763369034822.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341792i9856B37A228D4ABA/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="nicolasmasq_5-1763369034822.png" alt="nicolasmasq_5-1763369034822.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Antibes CIO, Patrick Duverger, has led the city to winning multiple innovation awards, including &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2023/11/city-of-antibes-redefines-digital-contract-management/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;the Territoria Gold Award 2023&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt; by the French Government and &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/discover/sap-innovation-awards/index.html?pdf-asset=68149708-fb7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&amp;amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Innovation Award 2025&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Since the new green law for municipalities came into force, Antibes were looking into “greening” its budget. This means the city is expected to quantify the environmental impact of their annual budget by tagging expenses to 6 EU Taxonomy objectives and 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In practice, it means attributing 6,000 budget expenses to one or many green objectives – which results in making over 138,000 decisions! Clearly this is beyond a human capacity to manage.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Leveraging Business AI with its advanced natural language processing, SAP was able to help.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Based on the descriptions of spend categories and those of the green objectives, AI was able to map all 6,000 budget categories to the relevant sustainable development objective in just about 15-20 minutes!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;This allowed the city to “green” their finances by providing a view to their inhabitants on how much of Antibes' annual budget was spent on each of the EU and the UN goals. Thanks to SAP Business, residents of Antibes can clearly see how the city is contributing to a better environment and how public funds are being used — fostering greater transparency and trust.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5" color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agentic AI Transforms Citizen Service Delivery&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In addition to handling administrative routing tasks in the back office, SAP Agentic AI will also change the way governments are serving their constituents.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Today citizens expect more straightforward, personalized, and agile services, and it is crucial for public sector agencies to meet these expectations - at a local, regional or federal level, they are eager to change the way they communicate and interact with the service recipients.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The overwhelming number of inquiries and human resource constraints is a common challenge to overcome and here SAP Business AI brings an immense value.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;A notable example from SAP Business AI impact is the German Federal Foreign Office, which is using SAP's Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) to streamline their services.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The Office manages Germany’s foreign relations with about 230 global missions worldwide. They are dealing with a high volume of inquiries globally and use multiple communication channels.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Using SAP BTP powered by natural language processing, as well as GenAI and Machine Learning capabilities, they have developed a centralized omnichannel communication processing system that integrates mail, tax, phone, portal and other correspondence modes in one single workflow. Using a ticketing system powered by AI, they were able to automatically classify and assign inquiries to the right processor in their organization.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Furthermore, SAP Business AI has been recommending the best resolution to each of the requests, relying on already resolved inquiries.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Since the project’s launch in 2021 through the completion of its phased rollout in 2023, the &lt;STRONG&gt;German Federal Foreign Office successfully leveraged AI to process more than 2 million messages and over 750,000 inquiries. Today, 50% of all incoming cases are resolved using AI-assisted template responses, eliminating the need for human intervention in those interactions.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="nicolasmasq_6-1763369098435.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341793iDA47FEA2269C643D/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="nicolasmasq_6-1763369098435.png" alt="nicolasmasq_6-1763369098435.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;For their AI project with SAP, the German Federal Foreign Office received first prize in the “Services Supernova” category at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/entries/2024-award.html?pdf-asset=9ad85437-a57e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&amp;amp;page=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;2024 SAP Innovation Awards&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;As a result, Federal Office employees managed to avoid inconsistent answers to similar questions, assign clear processing and status tracking responsibilities to the teams and, most importantly &lt;STRONG&gt;increase service speed – 77% of inquiries are now answered within the same day!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Let's now illustrate how this can translate to Agentic AI and transform citizen service delivery even better – based on one of the most complex service examples.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Consider a service officer of a local city council who handles high volumes of complex building permit applications. As legal requirements differ significantly depending on the object that is being built – requirements for a house construction are different from those for a swimming pool, for instance – ensuring regulatory compliance while managing strict service deadlines is challenging.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In addition to this, paper-based applications are frequently misplaced and subject to delays, thereby exacerbating the workload of service officers and resulting in applicant dissatisfaction.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A multi-agentic AI workflow from SAP would be ideal to address the situation. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Here’s how it can work. A builder submits a digital request for a new house construction, an AI-driven automation generates an application case. A multi-agentic AI team, consisting of four specialized agents is then stepping in.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A document agent&lt;/STRONG&gt; ensures application completeness and checks if all required documents are in place and all required information in entered. &lt;STRONG&gt;A permit rules agent&lt;/STRONG&gt; extracts decision-making criteria from the legal regulations and knows which criteria an application should fulfill to be granted an approval. It then validates the submitted evidence against the requirements and advises to the service officer if a positive decision should be granted. A &lt;STRONG&gt;clock agent&lt;/STRONG&gt; helps to ensure all processing steps are done within the maximum service delivery time and helps to schedule in-person inspections with the builder. &lt;STRONG&gt;A service agent &lt;/STRONG&gt;is there to draft personalized emails to the builder, confirming application entrance, payments, and scheduled inspections.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="nicolasmasq_7-1763369132697.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341794iD84138AFCA665168/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="nicolasmasq_7-1763369132697.png" alt="nicolasmasq_7-1763369132697.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Application Approval agents visionary demo screen&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;By leveraging Agentic AI, public sector officers can simplify the processing of complex services, such as building permit applications, expediting turnaround times while enhancing regulatory compliance with more accurate decision-making and applicant satisfaction.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5" color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New Horizons in Government Transformation with AI Agents&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;As we have seen AI Agents hold the keys to have a concrete application and real impact whether it is in front office or back office. Let us summarize the broader value public sector organizations will be able to seize from Agentic AI.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In the back office that unites key government operations such as finance, HR, and procurement AI agents are boosting productivity by up to 30%. They act as true teammates and make work more efficient, delivering more with fewer resources and at lower cost:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;AI agents boost civil servants’ productivity by executing repetitive manual tasks using specialized skills, expertise and knowledge – this reduces and prevent errors and allow to process high workloads.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;They can operate autonomously and across multiple departments, involving humans only at critical decision-making points - freeing up their time to focus on making those strategic decisions effectively.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Agentic AI helps new government hires to get a hang of complex back-office processes faster and run them with ease.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In the context of citizen services, AI agents provide scalability in times of high demand and enhance citizens satisfaction and trust in government:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Agentic AI is redefining the citizen experience by providing 24/7 support to resolve less critical issues, reduce friction points, and significantly shorten processing times for more complex cases. It also increases personalization by tailoring the content and making decisions based on the most relevant data.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;AI agents provide vital support during periods of exceptionally high demand. When unemployment rises or other economic shocks occur, and the public sector faces overwhelming volumes of service requests, AI agents help manage workloads beyond human capacity and allow civil servant to stay available in every scenario to answer special demands requiring special attention and compassion that only a human can do.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;On top, civil servants can free prioritize on citizen transparency, leveraging agents to help with public reporting and hence increase constituents trust.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;We recognize that despite the power of agentic AI, humans remain accountable for public sector decisions and use of this technology. Accordingly, SAP AI agents are designed under the SAP Global AI Ethics Policy with risk-calibrated autonomy and with great traceability to ensure that humans stay in control to review and approve work performed by agents.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;With this considered, Agents are a true revolution in the AI space – thanks to their advanced intelligence, governments have a new window of opportunity to simplify the way they work and to deliver next level impact in a positive and responsible way to their citizens.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Your consultant is right that you can’t change the phases themselves, but you can configure extra phase control codes to block the transition at that point and use them for team-lead approval.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The phase model is predefined and cannot be changed you can’t insert a new Phase 5.5.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For phase-based orders you can use phase control codes to control the movement between subphases/phases. If a phase control code is active, the system won’t let the order move to the next subphase/phase until that code is removed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/phase-control-codes-for-maintenance-orders-in-sap-s-4-hana/ba-p/13577223" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/phase-control-codes-for-maintenance-orders-in-sap-s-4-hana/ba-p/13577223&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You wrote: „teamlead approval of WOs before PRs are issued / WO is released”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In standard phase-based maintenance:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The order flows through the 9 phases&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;PRs for external services/non-stock materials can be configured to be created either when the order is saved or when it is released.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To make team-lead approval a hard gate before PRs and release, you typically combine:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Phase control codes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;and PR creation trigger set to order release, not order save.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Activity in CBC- Define Phase Control Code for Maintenance Orders(103676):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Define Authorization Keys&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Create an auth key for team leads, for example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="dawid90_0-1763383029618.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341915iE83BC09C46B4303B/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="dawid90_0-1763383029618.png" alt="dawid90_0-1763383029618.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Assign Entities to Order Types:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="dawid90_1-1763383029619.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341916iD8D29CE4EDC241A2/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="dawid90_1-1763383029619.png" alt="dawid90_1-1763383029619.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Define Phase Control Codes&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For Order Type = YA01, Entity = Order Header create:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Phase Control Code: TLA&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Description: Team Lead Approval&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Authorization Key: TLA&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Initially Active, so every new YA01 order starts with TLA active on the header&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="dawid90_2-1763383029619.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341914i8F33818D7A06679A/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="dawid90_2-1763383029619.png" alt="dawid90_2-1763383029619.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Define Phase Controls&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Phase control key = Block&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Process Phase: choose Scheduling.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Process Subphase: choose Ready for Scheduling (Order).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Subphase Description will fill automatically.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Effect&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;With TLA active on the header:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the system will not allow the order to move into Scheduling / Ready for Scheduling (Order)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Planners can work through Preparation (phase 5), but they cannot submit the order to Scheduling (phase 6) until someone removes TLA.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is exactly your gate between phase 5 and 6.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alternative:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;App Manage Workflows for Maintenance Orders&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F4989')/S35" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F4989')/S35&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can configure an approval step for certain order types/plants/values.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When an order is submitted for approval, it gets system status ORAR (Order Approval Required) and cannot be released until approved&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Workflow is often nicer for business users because they get tasks in My Inbox instead of hunting for orders with a certain phase control code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dawid&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1695826"&gt;@ShiZhekui&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;As you explain, this is a classic SAP global rollout challenge all over. Balancing local statutory requirements with HQ consolidation needs. SAP provides several mechanisms to handle exactly this situation without forcing subsidiaries to abandon their government-mandated codes. Please find the solution options below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Group Chart of Accounts (COA)&lt;BR /&gt;SAP allows multiple charts of accounts:&lt;BR /&gt;Operational COA: Used by subsidiaries for day-to-day postings (local statutory codes).&lt;BR /&gt;Group COA: Defined by HQ for consolidation.&lt;BR /&gt;Country-specific COA: For legal reporting if required.&lt;BR /&gt;Each G/L account in the subsidiary’s operational COA can be linked to a corresponding account in the Group COA. By this way Subsidiaries keep their local codes. HQ consolidates using the Group COA mapping.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Alternative Account Number&lt;BR /&gt;In SAP, each G/L account can have an alternative account number field.&lt;BR /&gt;Subsidiaries can keep their statutory account number as the main one, while HQ uses the alternative account number for consolidation. This is especially useful when government-mandated codes must appear in local reports but HQ needs a different structure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Mapping via Consolidation Tools (SAP Group Reporting / BCS / S/4HANA Group Reporting)&lt;BR /&gt;SAP consolidation solutions allow mapping from local accounts to group accounts.&lt;BR /&gt;You can define mapping rules Local account → Group account&lt;BR /&gt;Local account + Function Area → Group account line item&lt;BR /&gt;This handles the issue where subsidiaries don’t use Function Area: you can map their account splits directly to HQ’s reporting lines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. Use of Financial Statement Versions (FSV)&lt;BR /&gt;FSVs let you define reporting structures independent of the chart of accounts. Subsidiaries can keep their local chart, but HQ can build a consolidated FSV that maps accounts (and function areas) into the required reporting format.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1891280"&gt;@S_0019191663&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;,&lt;BR /&gt;I am currently preparing for the BTP exam. Considering the new format, is it enough to complete the Learning Journey, or should I still do more hands-on practice?&lt;BR /&gt;As I understand it, will the exam present a scenario where you need to record your answer and AI will evaluate it? Should the answer be final, meaning you cannot change it later after providing it? Does it take 24 hours?&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Could you please share more details about this new exam format for BTP certification? Any tips you have would be greatly appreciated!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Best&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hi, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I am currently an SAP HCM consultant with a focus on technical and functional aspects on ECC6 no knowledge on S4HANA. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I would like to develop my skills. I have knowledge of PA/OM and procedural ABAP techniques. With the aim of becoming a technical-functional expert in HCM, what learning roadmap would you suggest?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My goal is to become highly competent in the functional area, which represents about 85% of my work. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Do you have any other recommendations for courses to take and interesting certifications at SAP? (I have access to the SAP Learning Hub), so I am entitled to four certification attempts.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Output management in SAP S/4HANA governs the generation and distribution of business&lt;BR /&gt;documents, such as order confirmations, invoices, and delivery notes. With the advent of&lt;BR /&gt;S/4HANA, SAP introduced a new framework for output management leveraging the&lt;BR /&gt;Business Rule Framework Plus (BRF+), replacing the traditional NACE-based approach.&lt;BR /&gt;This new mechanism provides greater flexibility, improved user experience, and better&lt;BR /&gt;integration capabilities. Below is a comprehensive guide to configuring output&lt;BR /&gt;management for order confirmation using BRF+.&lt;BR /&gt;This documents provides a step by step guide to setup output using BRF+ for order&lt;BR /&gt;confirmation.&lt;BR /&gt;Step 1: Activate S/4HANA Output Management&lt;BR /&gt;Ensure that the output management functionality is activated in the system. This is done by&lt;BR /&gt;verifying the system configuration in SPRO:&lt;BR /&gt;Path: SPRO &amp;gt; Cross-Application Components &amp;gt; Output Control &amp;gt; Activate Output&lt;BR /&gt;Management.&lt;BR /&gt;Step 2: Define Output Types&lt;BR /&gt;Navigate to the relevant configuration to define output types for sales documents:&lt;BR /&gt;Path: SPRO &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Cross-Application Components &amp;gt; Output Control &amp;gt; Define Output Types.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Copy the standard and create new output&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3: Assign output channels&lt;BR /&gt;Path: SPRO &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Cross-Application Components &amp;gt; Output Control &amp;gt; Assign Output&lt;BR /&gt;ChannelsCopyOUTPUT)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Step 4: Define Rules for Determination of Master Form Template&lt;BR /&gt;Path: SPRO &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Cross-Application Components &amp;gt; Output Control &amp;gt; Define Rules for&lt;BR /&gt;Determination&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click on new entries&lt;BR /&gt;And enter the details as below&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Step 5: Assign Form Templates&lt;BR /&gt;Path: SPRO &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Cross-Application Components &amp;gt; Output Control &amp;gt; Assign Form&lt;BR /&gt;Tem&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Organization ID = company code Org&lt;BR /&gt;unit Type = Sales Org (VKORG) Org&lt;BR /&gt;Unit ID= SAGR (Sales org)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click on new entries and enter the below&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Form Template: SD_SLS_ORDER_CONFIRM (Standard)&lt;BR /&gt;Step 6: Define Business rules for output Parameter determination&lt;BR /&gt;Path: SPRO &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Cross-Application Components &amp;gt; Output Control &amp;gt; Define Business rules&lt;BR /&gt;for Output Upon clicking on it new web page will be opened&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Parameter determination Step1:&lt;BR /&gt;Determination&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click on Edit and add new&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sales Org&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Document Category C&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sales Order Type&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dispatch Time: 1 Immediate&lt;BR /&gt;Upon entering all the details, click on activate&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Parameter determination Step2:&lt;BR /&gt;Determination Step: Receiver&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click on Edit and new entries&lt;BR /&gt;New row will be populated.

    <content>if you have a number format including 0, the system will show that digit, it you use #, the system will show only significant digits. For example, using 00.0000 will show, 70.0000 and 00.#### will show 70.</content>

But does anyone have any idea what the problem might be or how it can be fixed?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;BR oeymen&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;is there a way in the LMS approval roles to exclude direct reports of specific users (top management)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For some trainings we have an approval process by the line manager when LMS users assign for a training.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If we use the standard&amp;nbsp;1-Step_Manager&amp;nbsp;approval process the approval request goes to every single manager.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We don't want to send the approval requests to managers from the top management level. We want rather to send these requests to our L&amp;amp;D team for approval.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there a way to do that in LMS?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Or if it is possible to exclude the direct reports of the top level managers, this would be also very helpful.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tanya&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Miquel,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;since the story worked previously and you do not have more data, then the issue should not be in the data self, but one approach would be to suppress zeros, however SAC first loads all data and then applies zero suppresion, so a work-around is a dummy-dimension checking measures (not SAC dimension based on measures, but in DSP self) and suppressing zeros via the dummy-dimension.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also try a blank, empty story, where you re-create the table from the AM 1:1 to the original story self. Check if that works. Kind of base-line strip-down. If that works, the issue is in the original story self. Maybe there was an update of the SAC optimizer and you are using a feature which was de-optimized. If that does not work&amp;nbsp;check the SAC Measurement Tool -&amp;gt; Client and Network tests, also&amp;nbsp;do also check the ASSOCs you use, do persist those VIEWS as well (the ASSOC views).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAC statistics can provide insight as well. I mean the background statistics, not the Analyze Story Performance in Runtime (I assume you already checked this one). MDS calls can be seen in the statistics including the SAC and browser time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not sure what steps did you already check, maybe you can list out what / where was already done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cheers, Martin&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are migrating the SAP ECC data to S/4 HANA tables. We have a list of ECC tables identified to migrate. I would like to know the corresponding S/4 HANA tables for each ECC table. Attached the list of Unique ECC tables.&amp;nbsp;&lt;A title="Unique ECC tables list" href="https://haleon-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/akshata_x_srikanth_haleon_com/Documents/Documents/Working_Folder/Unique%20ECC%20tables%20List.xlsx?d=wb39850efe5b145b5953e36150b4b8952&amp;amp;csf=1&amp;amp;web=1&amp;amp;e=Z67SBX" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Unique ECC tables list&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Could anyone help here with any document which has this information.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In today’s data-driven world, applications must process massive volumes of information with low latency and near-perfect reliability. This is exactly where &lt;STRONG&gt;Apache Kafka&lt;/STRONG&gt; shines. Often labeled as “just a message queue,” Kafka is far more powerful. Its architecture is intentionally designed for &lt;STRONG&gt;horizontal scalability&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enabling companies like LinkedIn, Netflix, Uber, and Airbnb to process &lt;STRONG&gt;trillions of events every single day&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This post breaks down &lt;STRONG&gt;how Kafka scales&lt;/STRONG&gt;, focusing on three core mechanisms:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Topic Partitioning&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Broker Clusters with Replication&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consumer Groups&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Together, these form the foundation of Kafka’s ability to scale seamlessly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1889057157"&gt;1. The Power of Parallelism: Kafka Topic Partitioning&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the core of Kafka’s scalability is its &lt;STRONG&gt;partitioned log&lt;/STRONG&gt; architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A Kafka topic is divided into one or more &lt;STRONG&gt;partitions&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages. This simple idea unlocks massive parallelism.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1821626371"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How Partitioning Works&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Producers write to partitions based on a key or round-robin.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consumers read partitions independently.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kafka guarantees &lt;STRONG&gt;order only within a partition&lt;/STRONG&gt;, not across the entire topic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This means if you need strict ordering for a particular key (like &lt;CODE&gt;userId&lt;/CODE&gt;), that key should always be routed to the same partition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1625112866"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Partitioning allows Kafka to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;scale horizontally across multiple brokers&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;process data in parallel&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;distribute workload efficiently across consumers&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the foundational mechanism behind Kafka’s ability to scale linearly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Visualizing Partitioning:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;EM&gt;Diagram 1&lt;/EM&gt;, the &lt;CODE&gt;user_events&lt;/CODE&gt; topic is split into P0, P1, and P2. A producer sends messages based on keys, and a consumer group reads them in parallel—each consumer handling one or more partitions. This parallelism gives Kafka its first—and most important—dimension of scale.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Diagram 1" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341908i2DB65235B55A1CB0/image-dimensions/760x752/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="760" height="752" role="button" title="Diagram1.png" alt="Diagram 1" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Diagram 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1299516642"&gt;2. High Availability &amp;amp; Horizontal Growth: Broker Clusters and Replication&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kafka clusters are made up of &lt;STRONG&gt;brokers&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and each topic partition is stored redundantly across them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1232085856"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Leader–Follower Model&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each partition has &lt;STRONG&gt;one leader replica&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Other brokers store &lt;STRONG&gt;follower replicas&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Producers and consumers communicate only with the leader&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If a leader goes down, Kafka automatically promotes a &lt;STRONG&gt;fully synced follower&lt;/STRONG&gt; to leader—usually within milliseconds.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1035572351"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In-Sync Replicas (ISR)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Replicas that are completely caught up with the leader are added to the ISR set.&lt;BR /&gt;Failover only happens within this ISR group, minimizing data loss risk.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-839058846"&gt;Why Replication Matters&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prevents data loss&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enables zero-downtime failover&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Helps scale reads&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Adds durability and resiliency&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Diagram 2&lt;/EM&gt; shows this setup clearly: multiple brokers, distributed replicas, and seamless failover—resulting in a system that can withstand broker crashes without downtime.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Diagram 2" style="width: 947px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341934iB450AA8021FF14CF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Diagram 2.png" alt="Diagram 2" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Diagram 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-513462622"&gt;3. Scaling Consumer Throughput with Consumer Groups&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Partitions decide how data is stored.&lt;BR /&gt;Consumer groups decide how data is consumed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A consumer group consists of multiple consumers cooperating to consume data from a topic. Kafka’s enforced rule:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A partition can be consumed by only one consumer within a group.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;This sets the upper limit on parallelism.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-575114555"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Parallelism Scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Partitions&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Consumers&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Result&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;All data consumed by 1 consumer (slow)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Perfect parallelism (fast)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;11&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Extra consumer stays idle&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If you need more throughput, you simply increase partitions OR add consumers—depending on which side is the bottleneck.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Diagram 3&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; visually represents this: more partitions → more potential parallelism → more throughput.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Diagram 3" style="width: 821px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341933i3B6B2DE061D68D35/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rishabhdhakarwal_0-1763386847847.png" alt="Diagram 3" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Diagram 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-120435612"&gt;Real-World Scaling Examples&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--444712269"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Over 7 trillion messages/day&lt;BR /&gt;Uses Kafka for activity logs, real-time analytics, and fraud detection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--641225774"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Netflix&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Processes billions of events/day for:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;device telemetry&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;QoS monitoring&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;recommender systems&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--837739279"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Uber&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Uses Kafka for:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;real-time trip events&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;fare calculations&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;live map updates&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These systems rely heavily on partitioning, replication, and consumer groups, the same principles discussed above.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--740849777"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kafka’s scalability isn’t an accident—it’s baked into its core architecture. Through &lt;STRONG&gt;partitioning&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;broker clusters with replication&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;consumer groups&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Kafka achieves a remarkable blend of high throughput, resilience, and horizontal scalability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whether you're building real-time analytics pipelines, event-driven microservices, or large-scale data streaming platforms, understanding these mechanisms helps you design systems that can grow effortlessly—from thousands to trillions of events per day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--937363282"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;References &amp;amp; Further Reading&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Apache Kafka Documentation — Architecture &amp;amp; Design&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A target="_new" rel="noopener"&gt;https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Confluent — Kafka Fundamentals &amp;amp; Internals&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A target="_new" rel="noopener"&gt;https://developer.confluent.io/learn-kafka/&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Spring for Apache Kafka&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Baeldung — Kafka Architecture &amp;amp; Components&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.baeldung.com/apache-kafka" target="_new" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.baeldung.com/apache-kafka&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</content>

    <content>The factory calendar in SAP affects any process that depends on working days, holidays, or date calculations. It influences scheduling in Production Planning (MRP runs, production orders), Plant Maintenance (maintenance plans and orders), and Sales &amp;amp; Distribution (delivery and transportation scheduling). It also impacts Purchasing (delivery dates, scheduling agreements), Warehouse Management (picking and goods movement planning), and Project System (network activity dates). In Finance, it affects payment runs and certain period-end processes. Essentially, any transaction that determines start or end dates, lead times, or capacity based on working days will rely on the assigned factory calendar.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Everonye,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Is there an audit trail report which can be used to track changes performed on reports in SF? I.e. What report config was changed, or what columns were added/removed from a certain report; when and by whom.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Is there an out of the box solution for this, or is this something we should build as a custom one? If the latter, has anyone ever built a report like this to audit report config changes?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Any input is warmly welcome! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thank you!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Adorján&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I think i could not agree more with the complaints on the C_AIG exam.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/10529"&gt;@DianaRoesner&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;I believe that revising this modality following the complaints implies that the previous one had issues. It would be at least fair to reset the number of available attempts, given that to this day, despite the case opened with learning support, I have not yet received any information on why I failed the exam, or on how it is evaluated and what the passing criteria are.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EDIT: the SAP support team has been very kind and confirmed that the attempt counter will be reset.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Diana&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We used to work on multiple choice many years. I would like to suggest to provide exam simulation session outside of the exam itself so that one can have look and feel instead of facing a new world and fail the first attempt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;BR&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We ran the program MMIM_S4SIC_CHECKS in a ECC6 system. In the log, we have the error check ID QTY_AGGR_CHECK&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Inconsistency between MCHB and MARD: unrestricted stock quantity MANDT: 400, MATNR: AL0821, WERKS: 1001, LGORT: 0069,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Note 2197392 tells that in case errors occur, we can analyze errors further with transaction MB5K and archive documents. But we do not want to archive our documents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is the way to correct this?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

A apresentação mostra como manter um “core” enxuto, confiável e integrado enquanto impulsiona novas formas de interação e valor — tanto internamente (colaboradores, processos) quanto externamente (clientes, ecossistema).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Você vai descobrir:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Estratégias para manter um core funcional simples, porém escalável, que suporte inovação sem criar complexidade desnecessária.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Como o engajamento — seja com usuários finais, parceiros ou o ecossistema — se torna um diferencial competitivo dentro da era SAP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Casos práticos ou insights de mercado que mostram o impacto direto dessa abordagem: aumento de produtividade, melhor usabilidade, menor custo de manutenção e maior agilidade.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Por que essa filosofia de “Clean Core + Engagement” importa para áreas como Finanças, Cadeia de Suprimentos, Compras, Transformação Digital — e como conecta com o universo SAP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":busts_in_silhouette:"&gt;👥&lt;/span&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Por que assistir?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Se você atua com transformação digital, SAP S/4HANA, automação de processos, gestão de mudanças ou inovação organizacional — esta palestra traz insights valiosos.&lt;BR /&gt;É a oportunidade de entender como adotar tecnologias de forma nativa no ecossistema SAP, sem depender de soluções alternativas ou pilhas desconectadas.&lt;BR /&gt;Além disso, você verá como essa nova abordagem pode trazer menos retrabalho, mais clareza nos processos e uma fundação pronta para evoluir.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":pushpin:"&gt;📌&lt;/span&gt; Não perca!

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi, Is there a requirement to have a separate License to use the "Cash Flow Analyzer" ? I think I might have read something like that in the past ...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Because FF7A/BN do not require an extra license.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/10529"&gt;@DianaRoesner&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I will be completely honest,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I wasted an opportunity without even trying. I clicked to take the exam because I was trying to check which certification version it was, and I didn't realize at all that the exam was about to start. I always thought, "It won't start because, like the other certifications, an SAP supervisor is required." The result was that I started the exam and wasted one opportunity out of four, without even having practiced the exercises..&lt;BR /&gt;Although I think it is a new good approach for this case, but sad that I missed one opportunity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Imagine walking into a library where every book is meticulously organized based on your interests and needs. Instead of wandering through endless rows of irrelevant titles, you find exactly what you’re looking for with ease. This is the transformative experience SAP Fieldglass Layout Manager now offers with its List View Support feature. Say hello to a new personalized experience!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="books-5937716_1280.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336930i62594B993F8CEFDB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="books-5937716_1280.jpg" alt="books-5937716_1280.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customize Your View, Your Way&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the new List View Support in the Layout Manager, you can customize list view columns across essential modules like Job Postings, Work Orders, and Statements of Work. You’re in control, deciding which columns stay and which can be set aside. Some essential columns, the ones highlighted in blue, are automatically included for clarity and efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of it as organizing a bookshelf adapted to your professional role. When you filter your view based on user roles, you focus directly on what’s relevant to your tasks. This approach lets users make informed decisions quickly, without getting stuck in unnecessary details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAP Companion (View In-App Help).png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336935i92A4DB4C03276925/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SAP Companion (View In-App Help).png" alt="SAP Companion (View In-App Help).png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ready to Curate Your SAP Experience?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Setting up your custom list view is as simple as arranging your favorite shelf. Organize your screen to reflect exactly what your role requires and keep the focus on the critical details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To create a list view:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sign in to your SAP Fieldglass account&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;Admin Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt; (gear icon)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;Layout Manager&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt; section&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;New&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enter a &lt;STRONG&gt;Name&lt;/STRONG&gt; and an optional &lt;STRONG&gt;Description&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Choose &lt;STRONG&gt;List Views (Current Data)&lt;/STRONG&gt; from the &lt;STRONG&gt;Type&lt;/STRONG&gt; dropdown&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Choose the desired module from the &lt;STRONG&gt;Module&lt;/STRONG&gt; dropdown&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then, add columns to your list view:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;Add Columns&lt;/STRONG&gt; to add the desired columns&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Check the checkboxes for the columns you want to include and uncheck the ones you want to remove (&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: grayed out checkboxes cannot be removed)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;Add&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;Add Module&lt;/STRONG&gt; if you want to add another module&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;Add &lt;/STRONG&gt;to create your list view&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, enjoy this personalized workspace, your own specially curated library within SAP Fieldglass.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Você verá:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Quais os impactos da IA nas dinâmicas de poder entre nações e blocos econômicos, e como isso reflete nas cadeias de valor globais.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;De que forma as funcionalidades de IA da SAP estão sendo moldadas para dar suporte a essas transformações — e como empresas podem aproveitar essa mudança como vantagem competitiva.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Exemplos práticos de aplicação de IA em ambientes SAP: automação inteligente, análise preditiva, melhoria de processos e integração de dados em escala.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Por que entender esse movimento é crucial para quem trabalha com transformação digital, estratégia de negócios, tecnologia ou governança corporativa.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":bell:"&gt;🔔&lt;/span&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Por que assistir?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Se você atua em estratégia de TI, inovação, operações ou negócios, essa palestra traz insights valiosos sobre como a IA pode ir além da automação — conectando ambiente externo (geopolítica) com ambiente interno (plataformas, processos e pessoas).

A apresentação aborda como escolher entre ambas as abordagens, quais os desafios e benefícios de cada uma, e como esses modelos se encaixam na arquitetura de sistemas empresariais modernos.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Você vai descobrir:&lt;BR /&gt;• O que caracteriza uma solução “Embedded” — totalmente integrada ao núcleo do sistema, com menor complexidade de manutenção, maior coesão e tempo de resposta mais curto.&lt;BR /&gt;• O que define um modelo “Sidecar” — um sistema paralelo ou acoplado externamente, que permite experimentação com menor impacto no legado, maior flexibilidade e independência, mas com possíveis desafios de sincronização e governança.&lt;BR /&gt;• Critérios para decidir entre Embedded e Sidecar — requisitos de negócio, volume e frequência de dados, necessidade de flexibilidade vs estabilidade, cultura de TI, custos de migração e operação.&lt;BR /&gt;• Exemplos práticos de implementação — como empresas enfrentaram trade-offs entre agilidade (Sidecar) e padronização (Embedded), quais foram os resultados em termos de governança, performance, tempo de entrega e suporte técnico.&lt;BR /&gt;• Como esses modelos se relacionam com áreas como operações, logística, finanças e cadeia de suprimentos — e como alinhar a escolha arquitetural com a estratégia global de TI e negócio.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Por que assistir?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Se você atua com arquitetura de soluções, implementação SAP, integração de sistemas, ou transformação digital em escala, esta palestra traz insights estratégicos e práticos para decidir o caminho certo em seu ambiente. Ideal para quem está avaliando modernizar sistemas legados, migrar para S/4HANA ou definir um roadmap de TI com foco em agilidade e governança.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":pushpin:"&gt;📌&lt;/span&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Acesse agora e se inspire&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/live/xZx556sjkKI?si=m--EbnKkcvsXLmjR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/live/xZx556sjkKI&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Não perca essa oportunidade de compreender como Embedded e Sidecar podem influenciar diretamente a arquitetura, performance e o futuro dos seus sistemas SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Patrocinadores:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":sports_medal:"&gt;🏅&lt;/span&gt; OURO: CHpro Solutions | CVA&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":3rd_place_medal:"&gt;🥉&lt;/span&gt; BRONZE: Lupus Consulting | FioriNET - Programação SAP ABAP Cloud S/4HANA Fiori UI5 | Aline ExplicaSAP&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":handshake:"&gt;🤝&lt;/span&gt; Apoio: Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":mobile_phone_with_arrow:"&gt;📲&lt;/span&gt; Quer receber as novidades em primeira mão.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;we are facing an issue in our SAP system where the freight costs in a sales order are automatically distributed proportionally across all item positions.&lt;BR /&gt;However, we do &lt;EM&gt;not&lt;/EM&gt; want the freight costs to be allocated to the items. Instead, the freight charge should appear only once at the &lt;STRONG&gt;order header level&lt;/STRONG&gt;, without being split among the line items.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Has anyone experienced this behavior or knows how to configure SAP so that freight costs remain exclusively at the header level? Any insights on configuration settings, pricing procedures, or condition type adjustments would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have created a data model of an uploaded MS Excel file. I granted my colleague Full Controll Access, but he cannot maintain the data model. He cannot Delete Facts and also Set Up the Import Job. Is it possible that only the Owner has Access to this functions?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;BR&lt;/P&gt;</content>
