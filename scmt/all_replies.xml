    <content>&lt;P&gt;Author: Allan Soo&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Healthcare public sector procurement spend is among the largest across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In 2021, 31.9% of all public procurement spend touches on public healthcare and infrastructure [&lt;A href="https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/policy-issues/public-procurement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/A&gt;]. Nearly 75% of public spend on healthcare came from taxpayers [&lt;A href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/decarbonising-health-systems-across-oecd-countries_5ac2b24b-en/full-report/rethinking-health-systems-supply-chains-pharmaceuticals-and-medical-products_1052fcf7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/A&gt;]. With an ageing population and a shrinking taxpayer base, governments across the world are grappling with these fiscal challenges. One solution is to deploy effective spend management, procurement solutions across cost-intensive sectors of the economy to keep costs down.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AllanSoo_0-1763015870827.png" style="width: 632px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339931i15D22FD6CDAC53F5/image-dimensions/632x491/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="632" height="491" role="button" title="AllanSoo_0-1763015870827.png" alt="AllanSoo_0-1763015870827.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure depicting the percentage government expenditure across the OECD-EU countries for 2023 [&lt;A href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2025/06/government-at-a-glance-2025_70e14c6c/0efd0bcd-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;3&lt;/A&gt;]. Public sector procurement across the OECD-EU markets was 14.7% (2023), an increase of 0.9% compared to 2019. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why an effective, public procurement platform is crucial for public healthcare and governments?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Public procurement in healthcare is one of the most regulated forms of purchasing dealing with hospitals, pharmacies, and qualified suppliers. This requires complex compliance to purchasing pharmaceutical ingredients, chemicals and other regulated products to be compliant to public healthcare agencies. An example is the procurement of surgical implants and tools which must comply with the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) and other dangerous goods regulations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Healthcare public procurement is becoming a significant challenge for governments worldwide due to factors such as an ageing population, rising deficits and total debts, the high costs of running healthcare facilities, and increased health and safety regulations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Track spend and compliance across cost-intensive healthcare segments by different categories with SAP Ariba Category Management, SAP Ariba Intake Management and SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle Performance Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Ariba Category Management gives public sector healthcare purchasers the tools to track spend goals on their most cost-intensive areas of their agency including high-tech equipment, specialized hospital beds, pharmaceutical purchases and more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The solution gives public healthcare purchasers the option to manage supplier performance and track these against budgets, manage funds and investments assigned and set to them by the government.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The solution also offers customers a 360-degree visibility into the supplier’s healthcare certifications and qualifications, making sure that they comply to directives and maximize compliance across all purchases made for the public facilities. For example, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) license for Australia, Wholesale Distribution Authorisation for EU suppliers supplying medicinal products, and Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency certification for medicinal product manufacturing in the United Kingdom.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Adverse events can then be monitored using SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance Management to manage supplier risks appropriately. 3rd party data such as D&amp;amp;B can give government buyers additional intelligence on the market risk of that supplier such as sustainability, supply chain exposure, and aid in calculating inherent and residual risk scoring…and so on. Up to 25 custom risk scores can be applied to the healthcare supplier in SAP Ariba Supplier Risk.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Renegotiate and manage multiple quotes across healthcare suppliers to drive cost savings with finance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To keep costs down, buyers have the ability with SAP Ariba Sourcing and Procurement for Public Sector in SAP S/4HANA, to manage different quotes and renegotiate prices with existing suppliers to obtain better deals. For example, evaluating the procurement of multiple MRI and X-ray machines, and different existing drug prices to encourage better competition between pharmaceutical suppliers to drive down prices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Buyers can take advantage of the SAP Taulia Private Cloud solution with SAP S/4HANA and Dynamic Discounting feature where fast, early account payable transactions towards suppliers can lead to discounted cash savings that yield improved bottom line benefits for public healthcare finance customers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Connect SAP Ariba Sourcing and SAP Ariba Buying solutions to the SAP S/4HANA ERP for high-level spend management and monitoring&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go beyond purchasing and ordering with high-level dashboard spend visibility [&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2021/08/aaf4122d-f87d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;4&lt;/A&gt;] to track the list of purchase orders with SAP Ariba Central Procurement with SAP Ariba Buying (3EN) and SAP Ariba Buying, with guided buying capabilities (2NV) into SAP S/4HANA. Easily track the process flow of your purchases and export accounting documents to SAP finance and accounting solutions. Use three-way matching against invoice, purchase order and goods receipt to ensure that cost information is accurate. Request quotes from suppliers, allocate budget and discuss on pricing terms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One highly relevant area for this is the operational procurement of medical apparel, protective equipment, gloves and face masks. You as the buyer want the tools to negotiate with suppliers on favorable pricing terms, sort price lists in Catalogs available over the SAP Business Network, and see the list of purchase orders, invoices and goods receipts in one place. You can set estimated budgets throughout the quotation process and track how far below under the target price you are able to get the costs down to attain cost savings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AllanSoo_1-1763015870830.png" style="width: 575px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339932iF0FA152F1F1796A9/image-dimensions/575x473/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="575" height="473" role="button" title="AllanSoo_1-1763015870830.png" alt="AllanSoo_1-1763015870830.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure showing SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing solution where healthcare purchasers can track how far below taxpayer funded budget they can obtain when purchasing medical supplies like gloves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With these solutions, healthcare public sector buyers and public finance can move away from matching for accuracies and scrutinize cost details on these items and work collaboratively with other departments to find alternative suppliers and products that offer cheaper and better-quality substitutes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Leverage AI solutions for contracts management &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Ariba Contract Intelligence by Icertis SolEx has contract authoring capabilities that are bolstered by AI to automate much of the clause generation that is in line with the public healthcare industry and to drive compliance. Examples can include authoring in sustainability criteria, medical manufacturing license requirements from suppliers, and assigning responsibilities on direct suppliers and their affiliates. By automating the contract lifecycle, lead times can be reduced and anomalies within contract clauses can be detected and flagged for risk mitigation. The solution helps users identify contract leakage risks to prevent cost blowouts and put boundaries on spend conditions for public healthcare purchases. Risk scores on suppliers can be imported from SAP Ariba Supplier Risk to SAP Ariba Contracts to guide contract awarding decisions so that risk-aware awarding decisions can be made. Managing suppliers is part of the public sector procurement responsibility to ensure that government healthcare agencies continue receiving the best outcomes for the budget they are given with the right contracts in place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Put cost guardrails on healthcare goods and services procured&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With WK value contracts [&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/configuring-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-sales/working-with-value-contracts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;5&lt;/A&gt;] in SAP S/4HANA, SAP Ariba Contracts [&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/strategic-sourcing/contract-administration/configuring-central-contracts-integration-between-sap-ariba-contracts-and-sap-s-4hana-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;6&lt;/A&gt;] users can set guardrails against overspending on suppliers. Given that in healthcare settings the quantity of goods can be non-negotiable, SAP Ariba Contracts offers the flexibility to adjust quantity (through quantity contracts) and assign other attributes such as discounts on purchased goods through supplier collaboration and negotiations. Buyers can set cost parameters on the value contracts and publish it through the Cloud Integration Gateway to SAP S/4HANA. Purchase cost data can then be ingested by finance solutions to monitor and act on the financial performance of the health agency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Smart Peppol invoicing with SAP S/4HANA and SAP Ariba Central Invoice Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With eInvoicing solutions offered with SAP Documents and Reporting Compliance (cloud edition) within S/4HANA ERP Public Cloud Edition, SAP Business Network via SAP Integration Suite, and SAP Ariba Central Invoice Management - Peppol compliant documents can be exchanged to help government healthcare sectors align with eInvoicing compliance requirements or eliminate the use of physical paper. Eliminating physical paperwork and complying to Peppol eInvoicing means enhancing fraud-prevention systems in place to build trust with the public and install financial protections, improves productivity and minimizes errors in costing amounts. &amp;nbsp;Peppol is used by over 40 countries worldwide for business-to-government transactions, and is becoming a standardized, secure method of receiving invoices from the private sector supplier base by government agencies. Public hospitals and other healthcare agencies can examine and analyze invoice costs based on the high-fidelity information supplied electronically within the system, making it easily auditable for finance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-driven Statement of Work (SOW) creations in SAP Fieldglass to alleviate workloads and focus on the things that matter&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Minimize admin work and hire contractors to help comply to a variety of laws during the SOW creation process. Use the GenAI solution at SAP to identify opportunities to control costs during the SOW creation and reduce document creation times by about 71% by inputting titles, summaries and extracting data from PDF documents. With freed-up workloads, users can focus on the quality, risk and service traits of the contract (such as proper skills matching for best labour productivity outcomes). An example includes SOW creation for biohazardous health waste disposal services and scoping the boundaries of work, and clearly stating what services are in and out of scope and using SOW teams feature to collaborate with non-procurement colleagues on budget planning with finance that addresses high-spend service categories.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improved SOW rates negotiation and cost management features on contracted services&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Service buyers can negotiate for better rates post-agreement, automate offboarding signatures to cease spend, ensure hours worked are fulfilled by the contractors, reallocation of unspent SOW funds back to master SOW, inactivate cost centers when they are no longer used, and trigger alerts when rates vary away from agreed ones. These are features that are offered by SAP Fieldglass to service buyers in public healthcare settings to put a lid on costs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Picture this, you need to onboard technicians to provide maintenance and calibration services for the complex equipment that the hospital has. Your rates need to be specified clearly, and any pay deviations need to be notified to the service buyer, clear start-end dates for the services and so on need to be in the SOW for legal reasons. You use the GenAI feature to produce an SOW quickly, double check the contents of this document, and have the work order issued. Skills are clearly specified for the job to minimize lead times onsite, and the best labour-hire is made. Therefore, costs are controlled, and the best productivity is obtained for maintenance work at the hospital.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Support green procurement practices&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Ariba Sourcing integrates with the suite of SAP S/4HANA Cloud ERP sustainability solutions to drive green procurement practices across the public healthcare sector. Given that Scope 3 contributes to around 79% of total carbon emissions [&lt;A href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carbon+emissions+healthcare+sector+globally+Scope+3&amp;amp;sca_esv=b1a2f407046ddbac&amp;amp;sxsrf=AE3TifO-KxpXajNNKV03ikSAti2X8Ryd6Q%3A1763012894710&amp;amp;ei=HnEVacb2KujU1e8Pq86V4Qg&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG_crqtu6QAxVoavUHHStnJYwQ4dUDCBE&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;oq=carbon+emissions+healthcare+sector+globally+Scope+3&amp;amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiM2NhcmJvbiBlbWlzc2lvbnMgaGVhbHRoY2FyZSBzZWN0b3IgZ2xvYmFsbHkgU2NvcGUgMzIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRifBUiuDFDhBljNC3ABeAGQAQCYAeUBoAHYCaoBBTAuNi4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIIoAL3CcICChAAGLADGNYEGEfCAgcQIRigARgKwgIEECEYFZgDAIgGAZAGCJIHBTEuNi4xoAfqLbIHBTAuNi4xuAfyCcIHBTAuNy4xyAcQ&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;7&lt;/A&gt;] for this sector across the OECD markets, governments can use SAP tools to drive sustainable procurement practices on their direct suppliers. Examples including procuring gloves with a low product carbon footprint, high recycled content, and rubber data to ensure that illegal deforestation has not contributed to its production.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alongside SAP Ariba Supplier Management, SAP Fieldglass and SAP Ariba Contracts, public healthcare sectors can manage risk appropriately and enforce sustainability practices and compliance on suppliers and contractors. This includes due diligence screening solutions on a supplier’s human rights and deforestation records, having the right sustainability credentials, and embedding sustainability due diligence into the core operational and strategic sourcing processes from procurement to the ERP environment. Given the mandates that governments must meet for their own net-zero, human rights and material circularity directives - SAP Ariba, SAP Fieldglass and SAP ERP Sustainability solutions provide a comprehensive suite of products to drive decarbonization and compliance in the public healthcare space. Partner solutions on the SAP app store can be used to enrich supplier data with sustainability scores and other external intel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tap into the SAP Spend Intelligence in SAP Business Data Cloud solution for rich data reporting on procurement spend&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enrich healthcare spend data with other SAP Business Data Cloud products to gain deeper insights into the entire healthcare organization’s finance and spend data. SAP Spend Intelligence offers customers a large variety of data products it can ingest. For example, sustainability, risk, contract leakages and off-contract purchase order spend. &amp;nbsp;By providing strategic and operational insights into a public healthcare’s spend, buyers can optimize for and eliminate out non-compliance and uses AI and machine learning to automatically allocate spend categories neatly for interpretation. SAP Joule can be employed to clean and present cluttered data in a meaningful way that helps drive high-level decision-making processes which maximizes healthcare spend impacts and cuts down maverick and unwanted tail spend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Ariba, SAP Fieldglass and SAP S/4HANA ERP solutions provide finance and spend management solutions that offer customers the tools to keep up to date with the latest innovations in driving cost savings, optimize spend, manage down risks, reduce fraud and work collaboratively with public sector finance teams in government. Given the significance of public healthcare sectors across developed markets, innovative procurement spend management solutions play a key role in controlling costs in a high-expenditure industry. For years to come, healthcare expenses are projected to increase with an ageing population, rising deficits and living cost challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This requires a comprehensive, suite of solutions for the public sector that leverages best-of-breed AI and solution offerings that advance the modernization of public sector procurement and finance operations. Governments have a responsibility to foster trust, comply to own directives, address fiscal challenges across the economy for the wellbeing of citizens, and deliver services cost-effectively to the public.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

This is what the error message tells you by "&lt;EM&gt;Please try refreshing the story, modifying the story and trying again".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;When you make a change and save the story, the stories metadata gets refreshed and sometimes that fixes some of these issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If these steps do not work, open a support incident with SAP Support, referencing SAP Note 3409867.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello SAP Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have a question regarding the implementation of a reverse factoring process in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;**Background:**&lt;BR /&gt;- Customer uses reverse factoring (supply chain finance)&lt;BR /&gt;- Dedicated scope item 4AV has been scoped out based on customer requirements&lt;BR /&gt;- Manual workaround using standard apps and postings is preferred&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;**Business Flow:**&lt;BR /&gt;1. Invoice received from supplier: ¥1,000,000 (accounts payable created)&lt;BR /&gt;2. Customer requests reverse factoring from factoring company&lt;BR /&gt;3. Factoring company pays supplier: ¥950,000 (¥50,000 factoring fee deducted from supplier)&lt;BR /&gt;4. Customer pays factoring company on extended payment date: ¥1,000,000&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;**Proposed Accounting Entries:**&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. AP creation (Feb 10):&lt;BR /&gt;DR: Expense 1,000,000&lt;BR /&gt;CR: Accounts Payable (Supplier account) 1,000,000&lt;BR /&gt;→ App: Supplier Invoicing (MIRO equivalent)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Factoring company pays supplier (Feb 15):&lt;BR /&gt;DR: Accounts Payable (Supplier account) 1,000,000&lt;BR /&gt;CR: Accounts Payable (Factoring company account) 1,000,000&lt;BR /&gt;→ App: Manual Journal Entry (FB01 equivalent)?&lt;BR /&gt;*Or should this clear the supplier AP and create a new AP to factoring company?*&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Payment to factoring company on extended due date (Apr 30):&lt;BR /&gt;DR: Accounts Payable (Factoring company account) 1,000,000&lt;BR /&gt;CR: Bank 1,000,000&lt;BR /&gt;→ App: Post Outgoing Payments (F-53 equivalent)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;**Questions:**&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Is this flow technically feasible in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition? Are the App IDs I mentioned correct, or should I use different apps?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. What is the correct way to handle the AP transfer from supplier to factoring company in step 2? Should I:&lt;BR /&gt;- Use manual journal entry to transfer AP between vendors?&lt;BR /&gt;- Clear supplier AP and create new AP document for factoring company?&lt;BR /&gt;- Use a different approach?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. How should we manage the factoring fee (¥50,000)? Should it be:&lt;BR /&gt;- Recorded separately when payment occurs?&lt;BR /&gt;- Included in the initial AP transfer entry?&lt;BR /&gt;- Not recorded by customer at all (since supplier bears the cost)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. Are there any special master data settings required for reverse factoring suppliers (e.g., payment terms, vendor account groups, or other configurations)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;5. If this approach is not possible, what alternative process would you recommend? Please include:&lt;BR /&gt;- Which apps to use (with App IDs if possible)&lt;BR /&gt;- Accounting entries for each step&lt;BR /&gt;- Master data setup requirements&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Qingxi,&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The reason why you are unable to raise request 'Change Hyperscaler AWS Transit Gateway/ TGW Peering/Cloud WAN' is because you don't have the necessary authorization to do so.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In order to submit a service request for the 'Change Hyperscaler AWS Transit Gateway/ TGW Peering/Cloud WAN' template, an S-user must have the authorization 'Create Billable Service Requests' at the customer number level.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Upon reviewing your S-user ID, I found that the required authorization was only assigned at the installation level. Usually, you will need to contact your administrator listed in&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/userscontacts/impcont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Users &amp;amp; Contacts - SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;to have the authorization assigned.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For more detailed information on S-user authorizations required the Private Cloud Service Request application, please refer to KBA&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2669783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2669783 - S-user authorizations required for the Private Cloud Service Request application - SAP for...&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;SAP Support&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you see standard SAP Pricing procedure RM0000, you see two gross price conditions - PB00 and PBXX&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In PB00 settings, you can see a calculation schema RM0002 assigned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;RM0002 includes supplementary pricing conditions (Discounts, Delivery etc). If you defined any new condition types and included in your pricing procedure, then see that they are included here too. Then you can see them in RFQ &amp;amp; Contracts too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For Header/Item conditions :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Condition type to be defined as both Header and Item in condition type settings&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Group Condition : If you do not check this box, then absolute header condition value is copied in all items. If it's checked, then Absolute Value given in Header is apportioned according to value of each item w.r.t total of all items. Or you can define a routine and assign in config according to which header value is apportioned to items. Note that this also influences how pricing scales determine PO Item price (based on total group value instead of individual item value which is beneficial)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you configured a custom pricing procedure, ensure you have similar condition type setup as PB00 for your automatic gross price condition type (e.g. ZB00) and assign a calculation schema (e.g. RM0002 or ZM0002) in that (ZB00) as explained above.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;If you have used custom schema for Supplementary conditions ZM0002 define it similar to RM0002 and add your additional condition types as required.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Suggest you to try in Sandbox and explore until you get what you want.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Trust this helps&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Aakash,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Have never tried this as KMAT scenarios are not very common and it has some restrictions in SAP compared to other materials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you define the Special Procurement Key 80 in Material master, would it help ? Can you test it and see ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sale order in Plant - B; But production in Plant A (as per Sp.Proc 80).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ramki&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Could you share your opinion if automatic iCalendar invitation can be sent automatically always when CRM Visit is created? Someone done this before? iCalendar invitation should be sent always when User (i.e. Sales Rep) creates activity - Visit (custom transaction type) as a follow up from Lead, Opportunity, PQ, Sales Order or Visit from the scratch. Receiver of the iCalendar invitation should be Contact person, sender Employee Responsible or Sales rep. All data are available on the Activity. Sender and receiver are available in Parties Involved section, time and date for iCalendar should be taken from Visit details Start Date/Time and End Date/Time. Present, we have CRM and Outlook calendars sync. All Visits are automatically sent to Sales Rep outlook calendar. I know that email can be triggered thru campaign automation flow but we want to send iCalendar invitation instead of email; with reminder.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Michał&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear SAP Team,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I appreciate your efforts in addressing the end-user visibility issue. Many customers can now deactivate or remove their custom developments that manage the "hide" action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have identified a specific scenario within our systems, and I would like to inquire whether your solution can accommodate this case as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our environment includes both &lt;STRONG&gt;custom and standard SAP applications&lt;/STRONG&gt;, such as the unfiltered &lt;STRONG&gt;INBOX,&lt;/STRONG&gt; which is &lt;STRONG&gt;assigned to all users via birthright roles&lt;/STRONG&gt;. These applications are assigned to all user, as we cannot predict which users will receive tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To enhance user experience, we have integrated these applications, including the INBOX, into various business pages, allowing users to access them with fewer clicks. This has resulted in a situation where pages that would typically be empty and hidden, containing only the birthright role-distributed app, are now visible - potentially displaying just the INBOX app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;Can you confirm if your solution addresses this specific case of distributing standard system apps by birthright role to all users?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We &lt;STRONG&gt;wouldn't like to offer only&lt;/STRONG&gt; the "To-Dos" section of the "My Home" Page or the INBOX application specifically filtered for business processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am working on SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, and I found an inconsistency between two apps for maintaining product master data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the &lt;STRONG&gt;“Manage Product Master Data”&lt;/STRONG&gt; app (used by business users), the following MRP fields are &lt;STRONG&gt;not available&lt;/STRONG&gt; under Planning/MRP views:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consumption Mode&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Forward Consumption Period&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Backward Consumption Period&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;MRP Group related consumption settings&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Other detailed MRP3 control fields&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, in the &lt;STRONG&gt;“Change Material / Manage Material Master (MM02)”&lt;/STRONG&gt; expert app, these fields &lt;STRONG&gt;are available&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and we can maintain consumption settings normally (e.g., Strategy 40 / 70 materials).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1893823562"&gt;My question&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is this behavior expected in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition?&lt;BR /&gt;Why are these consumption-related fields completely missing from &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Product Master Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;, even when the material uses strategy groups that require consumption (40, 70, B6, etc.)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1697310057"&gt;What we have checked&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;MRP Type = PD&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Strategy Group = 40 / 70&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;All relevant master data settings exist&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;The fields appear correctly in the expert material app (MM02)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;No option to enable these fields through Custom Fields &amp;amp; Logic (CFL)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;No obvious setting in SSCUI or configuration to expose these fields&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1500796552"&gt;Business Impact&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business users need to maintain consumption settings, but they can only use &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Product Master Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and the app does not provide these fields.&lt;BR /&gt;We want to understand if:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is SAP’s intended design (only expert app can maintain consumption settings),&lt;BR /&gt;or&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;If there is a way to make the missing fields available in the simplified master data app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1304283047"&gt;✔ Question to SAP / Community&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is this a known limitation of the “Manage Product Master Data” app?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there any official documentation explaining which MRP fields are intentionally restricted in this app?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there a recommended way to allow business users to maintain consumption mode/period?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Do we need to assign a specific business role (e.g., SAP_BR_PRODMASTER_SPECIALIST) to make these fields appear?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any guidance or confirmation from SAP or other practitioners would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Aght_0-1763019972060.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339948iB5468A3828535A23/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Aght_0-1763019972060.png" alt="Aght_0-1763019972060.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;we are using the Cash Transfer App (ID F0691) to transfer money from one bank account to another bank account. In addition, we are using the Bank Communication Management to create payment batches and send them to the Bank.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The batches are created automatically through the app and includes only one payment. Is it possible to stop the batch process and create batches with more than one payment?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Gurus,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We're having a requirement where we would create a Model based on Success Factors customer OData Service API.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However after succesfully connecting and when reading the API we're getting error, the customer Odata API is a paramterized API and SAP is saying that this is not supported in SAC as it's a tool limitation , any idea how we can consume this and create a story on top of this customer Odata API , or is there any other way to read the data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've attached the error and steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Baseer&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/170423"&gt;@SEdelstein&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;for the app Travel and Expenses for Travel Assistant (Fiori ID F0584B) the feature description states that users can:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;“Handle expense reports on behalf of other employees.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How can this functionality be activated? In the standard setup, there is no option to maintain or select another personnel number.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Furthermore, the feature appears to be implemented in the Travel Assistant app itself. Is the “on-behalf” functionality actually available in F0584B, or was it perhaps added to the feature list by mistake?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards&lt;BR /&gt;Jonny&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Does this mean that Payment Information should never be added to custom Hire Templates? Payment Information is an effective dated MDF.&amp;nbsp; If this is the case Hire templates in Onboarding becomes obsolete in the context of Onboarding as this information needs to be captured.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How do we approach this?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Frans&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>I realize that right after starting Eclipse, there's no bug after pressing Ctrl+F. It happens only after a number of actions; I can't say what are the minimal steps to reproduce the problem.</content>

This could lead to the situation you are currently encountering.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Aarnav&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi Jörg, I am commenting here because I landed here first in my search for a solution. I subsequently compiled the following information: - In the snote "2399633 - HANA Studio connection fails to tenant database in Multiple Tenant Database in a NATted network" your suggestion is recommended. - But, if you develop graphical calculation views and have a certain network configuration, you have no access to the tables in the graphical calculation views. Workaround can be found here: "0002740065 - Table columns are not displayed in the Projection node when creating a HANA Calculation View"</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have the following requirement:&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Let's say I have a service order for 10 hours. It actually takes 15 hours to complete the service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Nonetheless I just want to bill the customer only 10 hours but would like to record 15 hours cost for internal cost calculations. Is that possible? I tried various settings with service orders and fixed price service orders but haven't been able to achieve the above.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Proposals for Matching Certificate Receipts in SAP Cloud ERP 2508.3 (HFC10)</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As part of our commitment to continuous innovate; I would like to draw your attention to the latest innovation for the 2508.3 (HFC10) release in Quality Management. Here, I would like to introduce a powerful enhancement to simplify how you manage incoming quality certificates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;We understand that a common challenge in quality management is the manual work required to link an incoming quality certificate to the correct goods receipt, especially when the system cannot make an automatic match. A missing purchase order number or a minor data discrepancy could previously stop the automated process, forcing a user to manually investigate and link the document.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With the new AI-assisted capability coming with 2508.3 (HFC 10),&amp;nbsp; the system now acts as your intelligent assistant. If a certificate cannot be automatically matched due to insufficient data, the system doesn't just stop. Instead, it uses the data it has successfully extracted such as the material, batch, or supplier to propose a list of potential certificate receipts.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="List of potential certificate receipts" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339532iD384D8D44663CF63/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Blog_Post_2508.3.png" alt="List of potential certificate receipts" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;List of potential certificate receipts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Inside the Review Certificate Document Matches app, you will find a new section dedicated to these proposed matches. Now, instead of starting a manual search from scratch, you can simply review the system's suggestions. Accepting a correct match is a one-click action that attaches the certificate to the corresponding receipt and updates all relevant data. This transforms a tedious manual search into a simple and quick validation step, significantly reducing the risk of errors and freeing up your quality team to focus on more strategic tasks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can watch the new matching feature in this demo:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_kv79r5p2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;Click here to find further details about the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/d1e58be39d884a0dbf75a7526a9acbf4/46a0ffd9c19d4dde88861505889b14b1.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Integration of Document AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;Take care and till the next update!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;Markus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;can you please describe little bit the business purpose behind this? It looks odd to check just Net Value of Sales Order. There can be multiple Sales Orders with same value. You are not checking anything else, just VBAK-NETWR.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Code also does not look very robust. Presented CSV parsing is just for this use case, it cannot be really used universally (there are tools, classes, libraries for that already).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is this blog generated with AI?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear customer,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for your prompt response.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've also checked in our internal system and it seems that the current standard configuration does not support exporting Alerting filters directly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As the workaround, you may consider saving the data collection or alerting filters using Reusable Filter Variants or Configuration Variants. For detailed guidance on this approach, I recommend reviewing KBA &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3668126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3668126&lt;/A&gt; - How to use Variants in Integration &amp;amp; Exception Monitoring in SAP Focused Run. This resource provides step-by-step instructions to help you utilize these variants effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If this solution does not fully meet your requirements, SAP offers a variety of self-service channels to assist with additional inquiries:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP For Me Support Portal -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://me.sap.com/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Help Portal - &lt;A href="http://help.sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;http://help.sap.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Community - &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/community.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.sap.com/community.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please consider the above options for future interactions.

I believe that SAC Calendar is a powerful tool that offers many interesting features but in my many years of consulting I have only used it for "Schedule Publication" for onInit scripts in Applications or for Data / Multi action Tasks (so basically just scheduling). What I am missing in SAP materials is some complex guide / learning journey / materials / webinars how the Calendar Tasks can be used to support complex Planning Processes / Workflows, while being easy / user friendly to maintain (in most cases it becomes too complicated to maintain).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Do you know about such guides / learning journeys / materials / webinars?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you very much!&lt;BR /&gt;Adam Vacek Nekola&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi, On the same topic, is anyone else having the issue of sysOverallcustom01 and 02 bringing ALL ratings in the system, meaning: Performance, Potential, Objective and Competency? If so, how do use these custom fields, do you just use them in an environment that doesn't have any of the other 4 types of ratings? Thank you, Raluca</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is an architecturally innovative ERP solution that addresses the need for businesses to integrate their end-to-end processes. One of the critical components offered by this platform is the &lt;STRONG&gt;Solution Order&lt;/STRONG&gt; structure, which consolidates multiple business objects under a single operational document. For example, when a technology company sells a new server to its customers, it can combine the server's installation service, annual maintenance contract, and even a custom software integration project under a single Solution Order. This allows all processes to be easily tracked and managed from one central order document.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Resim1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311606i1370C204916A446F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Resim1.png" alt="Resim1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1630863727"&gt;1&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solution Order Architecture&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, the Solution Order acts as a &lt;STRONG&gt;master document&lt;/STRONG&gt;, centrally managing different &lt;STRONG&gt;item categories&lt;/STRONG&gt; (e.g., product, service, project, subscription). This structure is designed to support customer-centric, hybrid sales scenarios, in contrast to silo-based order models in traditional systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Technically, when a Solution Order master document is created, the system automatically triggers and generates different &lt;STRONG&gt;follow-on documents&lt;/STRONG&gt; corresponding to these item categories in the background. For instance:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;product item&lt;/STRONG&gt; transforms into a &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order&lt;/STRONG&gt; document, initiating relevant logistics processes (shipping, delivery).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;service item&lt;/STRONG&gt; triggers a &lt;STRONG&gt;Service Order&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;Service Notification&lt;/STRONG&gt; document, starting field service management processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;project item&lt;/STRONG&gt; links to a &lt;STRONG&gt;Project&lt;/STRONG&gt; document, creating work breakdown structures (WBS) and activities within the project management module.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;subscription item&lt;/STRONG&gt; generates a &lt;STRONG&gt;Subscription Contract&lt;/STRONG&gt; document, enabling recurring billing processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This approach ensures that all these disparate business objects are linked within the &lt;STRONG&gt;document flow&lt;/STRONG&gt;, making the Solution Order master document a single operational monitoring point.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Mert_Atay_1-1757414054032.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311603i0EADF892515B56BF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Mert_Atay_1-1757414054032.png" alt="Mert_Atay_1-1757414054032.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1434350222"&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Technical Differences from Standard Sales Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Solution Order offers a more integrated and dynamic data model compared to the traditional Sales Order structure.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Data Model and Integration:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; While a standard sales order typically focuses solely on product management (SD) and logistics processes, the Solution Order leverages SAP S/4HANA's unified data model to combine different modules such as SD, Service, Project Systems (PS), and Subscription Billing into a single process. This ensures data consistency and integrity.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;API Integration:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is developed with an &lt;STRONG&gt;API-first&lt;/STRONG&gt; approach. The Solution Order object can be created and managed via &lt;STRONG&gt;OData services&lt;/STRONG&gt; from external systems (e.g., CPQ - Configure, Price, Quote - solutions or custom customer portals). This provides a flexible platform for end-to-end process automation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Billing Processes:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; While standard sales orders typically generate a single invoice document, the Solution Order can trigger different billing plans with a &lt;STRONG&gt;central billing engine&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This allows for managing various billing methods under a single order, such as &lt;STRONG&gt;milestone billing&lt;/STRONG&gt; for projects, &lt;STRONG&gt;time-and-materials&lt;/STRONG&gt; billing for services, or &lt;STRONG&gt;recurring billing&lt;/STRONG&gt; for subscriptions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1237836717"&gt;3&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Advantages and Disadvantages&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Advantages&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Process Orchestration:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Enables different business units (sales, finance, project, service) to collaborate in a unified operational process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Data Integrity:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Provides a single, consistent view of data as all process documents are linked to one master document.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Automation and Scalability:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; API integration allows for automated document creation and process management with external systems, increasing operational efficiency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Structural Complexity:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; The integrated and multi-module nature of the process may require deeper technical knowledge and system configuration during implementation and adaptation phases.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configuration Dependency:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Due to the Public Cloud's strategy of adopting standard processes, the flexibility of the Solution Order structure depends on predefined business processes. Custom developments (extensibility) might be limited for highly specific or non-standard processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Solution Order in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud provides a strong foundation for managing the complex and integrated business models required by the digital economy. This structure is a core component of the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Intelligent Enterprise"&lt;/STRONG&gt; vision, enabling businesses to enhance customer value by offering integrated solutions rather than merely selling products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1041323212"&gt;4&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configuration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There are two main customization steps for the solution order. These customizations can be accessed through the following tabs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solutions --&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Solution Management --&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Solution Orders --&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Solution Order Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-973892426"&gt;4.1&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Copy Sales Order Type in Solution Orders&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With this customization, determination of which sales order document types can be used with reference to a solution order is carried out.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Mert_Atay_0-1759428784705.png" style="width: 621px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/322379i86EE309C4B74A80D/image-dimensions/621x315?v=v2" width="621" height="315" role="button" title="Mert_Atay_0-1759428784705.png" alt="Mert_Atay_0-1759428784705.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-777378921"&gt;4.2&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Copy Item Categories of Sales Items in Solution Orders&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With this customization step, it is determined with which order document type and which item category the item category selected in the solution order will be created in the next step.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this customization, the key fields are the solution order item category and the sales order document type. This means that by assigning two different sales order item categories to a single solution order item category across two different sales order document types, it allows different processes to be executed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Mert_Atay_1-1759428822971.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/322380i21017FDF9616D682/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Mert_Atay_1-1759428822971.png" alt="Mert_Atay_1-1759428822971.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-451782697"&gt;5&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Example Process&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Within the &lt;EM&gt;Manage Solution Orders&lt;/EM&gt; application, click the &lt;STRONG&gt;New&lt;/STRONG&gt; button to navigate to the solution order creation screen.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;First, the header information screen appears. On this screen, the customer and the contact person can be selected.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Mert_Atay_2-1759428851263.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/322381iBEE84DAB9CEFC25F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Mert_Atay_2-1759428851263.png" alt="Mert_Atay_2-1759428851263.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At the item level, a material is entered and in the &lt;EM&gt;Item Category&lt;/EM&gt; column the processes to be followed are selected.

Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Solution Order functionality in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt; represents a major step forward in the evolution of enterprise process integration. By consolidating multiple business objects—products, services, projects, and subscriptions—under a single operational framework, it enables organizations to deliver holistic, value-driven solutions to their customers rather than isolated products or services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Through its &lt;STRONG&gt;API-first architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;modular flexibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;end-to-end visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the Solution Order empowers businesses to orchestrate sales, service, and project operations seamlessly, reducing administrative overhead while enhancing process transparency and customer satisfaction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;While its implementation requires careful configuration and a solid understanding of SAP’s integrated data model, the long-term benefits—such as consistent data management, improved collaboration across departments, and scalable automation—make it an essential capability for any organization aiming to become an &lt;STRONG&gt;Intelligent Enterprise&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In essence, the Solution Order is not just a technical enhancement; it is a &lt;STRONG&gt;strategic enabler&lt;/STRONG&gt; that bridges business innovation with operational excellence, driving the digital transformation journey in the most comprehensive and structured way possible.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Michael,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;thank you very much for your reply. Yes, that’s exactly where I remove the user I shared the story with, and after that, they no longer appear in the list of reports in SAC. However, they can still access the report via the link they received by email at the moment I shared it. It would make sense to me that once I stop sharing the report with a user, they should no longer be able to access it through the email link either.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Taant_0-1763023401219.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339952iA59D9CAEAD2C19A0/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Taant_0-1763023401219.png" alt="Taant_0-1763023401219.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope I managed to clarify the issue I’m having &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;in the return PO, is the company "A" a supplier? If yes, have you checked that the "shipping data" tab on the PO item is filled in correctly?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As per my knowledge, if you haven't changed the standard customizing, this process should work correctly. Therefore, it seems more like an issue with the data in the documents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi, thanks for sharing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is that possible to create serial number automatically with a certain numbering rule? not the one as default start from 1, for instance, SN-YYYY-MM-DD-001, 002...?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Michael,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;thank you very much for your reply. Yes, that’s exactly where I remove the user I shared the story with, and after that, they no longer appear in the list of reports in SAC. However, they can still access the report via the link they received by email at the moment I shared it. It would make sense to me that once I stop sharing the report with a user, they should no longer be able to access it through the email link either.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Taant_0-1763023733098.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339953i35AB1E915A8D02C5/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Taant_0-1763023733098.png" alt="Taant_0-1763023733098.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope I managed to clarify the issue I’m having &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m writing this blog to share the resolution of an issue I recently encountered in my project. Hopefully, it will help others facing a similar challenge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Issue Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Working Scenario:&lt;BR /&gt;We are using an Employee Self-Service (ESS) Web Dynpro application based on LPD_CUST configuration in an SAP S/4HANA 2023 Rise system (For ECC also it will work).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application was working perfectly when our portal system and backend system were both using the HTTP protocol, with the connection established through a system alias in the portal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;When the Issue Started:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As per the SAP Rise team’s security guidelines, HTTP access to the S/4HANA system was disabled. Consequently, we had to switch our portal and load balancer configuration to use HTTPS instead, ensuring secure communication with the backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After implementing HTTPS, we tested the ESS application. While the Web Dynpro application worked fine in standalone mode, navigation within the portal (e.g., clicking “Create Leave Request”) stopped functioning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No errors appeared in the browser console or network tab — the click simply produced no response from the server. PFA the Screen shot for your reference (ESS Leave Request Application Navigation issue.JPG) .&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analysis:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;After reviewing multiple blogs and SAP community posts, I came across the following SAP Knowledge Base Article (KBA), which provided the key insight:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP KBA: 3369675 - FAQ: Enterprise Portal inner application navigation issues with Google Chrome Version starting 115/116 &amp;amp; Edge Version starting 118/119&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to this KBA, recent updates in Chrome and Edge introduced stricter browser policies affecting inner application navigation within the Enterprise Portal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resolution:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To resolve the issue, we updated the following parameter in the NWA (NetWeaver Administrator):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Current Value: PFA the Screen shot (Current Value of CustomResponseHeaders.JPG)&lt;BR /&gt;CustomResponseHeaders = {X-FRAME-OPTIONS=SAMEORIGIN}&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Updated Value: PFA the Screen shot (Updated Value of CustomResponseHeaders.JPG)&lt;BR /&gt;CustomResponseHeaders = {Origin-Agent-Cluster=?0}&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After applying this change we need to take application restart (All Application Server one by one).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Afte restart the parameter effected and&amp;nbsp; ESS application navigation started working correctly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This issue was caused by recent browser security updates impacting portal navigation behavior. Adjusting the response header as per the SAP KBA resolves the issue effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this post helps anyone encountering a similar problem in their SAP environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Best regards,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rohit Gera&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Do you see any specific reason to create consignment orders? I can understand if its a case of multi pick/drop, consignment order gives the flexibility. But for normal single drop, simple FO will also do the same ?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Ok, for those who might suffer the same problem, here is the solution:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, you need to disable authentication for C4C and html5 repo by setting the attribute&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;authenticationType: "none"&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This, on the other hand, will raise another issue of&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;CSRF Token Validation Failed&lt;/EM&gt; when you try to create/update record in your target system - C4C in my case. This can be fixed by introducing a&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;fetch&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;for a&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;CSRF&lt;/EM&gt; token in the following manner:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;context&lt;/EM&gt; is&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;this&lt;/EM&gt; that is passed to a helper method. The below is part of the helper method.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;fetch(`/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codataapi/[Collection Name]`, {
                method: "GET",
                headers: {
                    Accept: "application/json",
                    "X-CSRF-Token": "Fetch"
                },
            }).then((response) =&amp;gt; {
                context.getOwnerComponent()._token = response.headers.get("x-csrf-token");
            });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once you have the token, do the following before record creation / update:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;oModel.setHeaders({
                    "X-CSRF-Token": that.getOwnerComponent()._token
                });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope that can save someone sometime.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Br,&lt;BR /&gt;Aleks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Good day&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1955870"&gt;@Simon_Lehnert&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The public cloud does not reliably provide a list of all validation rules for each migration object. However, you can find some object-specific validation information for example Validation Rules for Business Partner page. This documentation, however, does not detail every field and all validation logic for uploads in the Migration Cockpit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can consider the blog &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/a-comprehensive-guide-to-data-migration-with-the-sap-s-4hana-migration/ba-p/14224541" target="_blank"&gt;A Comprehensive Guide to Data Migration with the SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Have you had a look at &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/doc/69dd0f1ef0034261ab6e617e0b2beb21/2022.latest/en-US/MigrationObjects_OP_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Migration Objects for SAP S/4HANA&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/f86dc2eb1f8b48c880a7607213104b27/1b8cf71b9f5743b3b1a3c1dee0896d61.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Validation Rules for Business Partners&lt;/A&gt; links?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let me know if you have further questions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In embedded SAP EWM, has anyone used t-code CKMDUVMAT for automate distribution of inventory Differences to Production orders, when Physical Inventory happens in EWM Storage location? Is it feasible?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

var resultSet = Chart_1.getDataSource().getResultSet();

// Check if there are any results
if (resultSet.length &amp;gt; 0) {
    // Get the first result (e.g., if it's a single summary value)
    var firstDataPoint = resultSet[0];

    // Get the formatted value of the measure dimension
    var measureText = firstDataPoint["@MeasureDimension"].formattedValue;

    // Set the text widget to display the measure value
    Text_1.applyText(measureText);
} else {
    Text_1.applyText("No data available.");
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hope this helps !&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nikhil&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Introduction: SAP EHS in the Public Cloud&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) helps organizations establish and maintain safe, sustainable, and compliant operations. The SAP EHS Public Cloud solution provides an integrated platform to manage environmental, occupational health, and safety processes more efficiently and transparently.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371622690"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.1 Deloitte's Objective &amp;amp; Approach&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the growing relevance of SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) in the Public Cloud, the objective of this blog series is to support the SAP Community by sharing Deloitte’s practical insights, lessons learned, and best practices from real project experience. We aim to provide a hands-on, experience-based guide that highlights both opportunities and key considerations for integrating SAP EHS Public Cloud into existing system landscapes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At Deloitte, we have implemented and extended SAP EHS Public Cloud across multiple customer environments. Based on this experience, we outline a step-by-step approach to help organizations successfully set up and integrate SAP EHS Public Cloud side-by-side with existing SAP solutions such as SAP S/4HANA On-Premise, SAP Master Data Governance (MDG), and SAP SuccessFactors.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This guidebook forms the foundation for the blog series. It demonstrates the architecture and approach we used in our internal proof-of-concept setup together with SAP, where we tested core EHS use cases – Incident Management, Risk Management, and Emissions Management – in a hybrid system landscape. Each part of the series focuses on one integration area, including practical implementation steps, lessons learned, and recommendations for EHS practitioners, architects, and sustainability professionals.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175109185"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.2 What can you expect from this Blog Series?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This blog series provides a structured, step-by-step guide on how to integrate SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) Public Cloud side-by-side with existing SAP landscapes.

At the same time, organizations face increasing challenges from business disruptions caused by regulatory changes, workplace incidents, and a continuously changing environment – requiring them to constantly adapt and adjust their operations. SAP EHS ensures that companies not only meet legal requirements but also foster a culture of responsibility and care. A well-implemented EHS strategy helps minimize risks, reduce incidents, and protect both people and the environment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For a detailed overview of SAP EHS capabilities and features, we recommend exploring the official SAP documentation and Learning Journey (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/outlining-environment-health-and-safety-overview" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-782082175"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.4 Why SAP EHS in the Public Cloud?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Transitioning SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) to the SAP Public Cloud provides organizations with a modern and continuously evolving platform to manage sustainability, compliance, and safety processes more efficiently. With frequent feature and regulatory updates delivered by SAP, companies benefit from the latest innovations without the need for complex upgrades or custom maintenance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A key advantage of SAP EHS in the Public Cloud is its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing SAP system landscapes. Organizations can extend their current on-premise or private cloud environments without disruption, connecting SAP EHS Public Cloud side-by-side with core ERP solutions such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Master Data Governance (MDG), or SAP SuccessFactors. This ensures consistent data flows, unified reporting, and a holistic view of environmental, health, and safety performance across the enterprise.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;From a business perspective, SAP EHS in the Public Cloud accelerates implementation, reduces total cost of ownership, and supports standardized processes and global compliance frameworks. At the same time, it offers the flexibility needed to adapt to evolving local regulations and sustainability requirements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) supports a wide range of processes that help organizations manage safety, health, and environmental requirements in an integrated and efficient way. Leveraging the Public Cloud, companies can standardize processes, ensure continuous compliance, and gain transparency across locations. The core capabilities range from incident reporting and risk assessment to chemical and emissions management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="EHS Solutions &amp;amp; Key Capabilities" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338132iA45E56D76E7A98AA/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1762793066866.png" alt="EHS Solutions &amp;amp; Key Capabilities" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;EHS Solutions &amp;amp; Key Capabilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-456485951"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-259972446"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Integrating SAP EHS Public Cloud Side-by-Side (Guidebook)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now that we have introduced SAP EHS and its value in the Public Cloud, this chapter explains how SAP EHS Public Cloud can be integrated into an existing enterprise system landscape side-by-side.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This section provides a practical guide on how to extend current on-premise or hybrid EHS capabilities with SAP Public Cloud innovations – without disrupting existing business processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We outline the system setup, architectural approach, and key technical prerequisites required for a successful implementation. The guide is based on Deloitte’s internal proof-of-concept, developed together with SAP and validated across three core EHS use cases.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By following this approach, organizations can understand how to seamlessly connect SAP EHS Public Cloud with their existing SAP solutions and build a scalable, future-ready, and compliant EHS environment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-192541660"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.1 Scope&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this guidebook, we focus on three core use cases that represent the most common and business-relevant EHS scenarios for our clients, making it ideal to demonstrate the side-by-side integration approach:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Incident Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Risk Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Emissions Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For detailed feature descriptions and configuration guidance, please refer to the official SAP EHS documentation and Learning Journey (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/outlining-environment-health-and-safety-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By concentrating on these use cases, we provide a clear overview of how SAP EHS Public Cloud can be integrated with an existing SAP landscape. Each scenario highlights key integration touchpoints, master data synchronization, and cross-process reporting requirements – without adding unnecessary complexity.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To illustrate these use cases in a practical and relatable way, we will refer to a fictional company, Mike Machineries, throughout this guidebook. This example helps demonstrate process flows, integration touchpoints, and system interactions in a realistic business context.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fictional Organization: Mike Machineries&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Fictional Organization - Mike Machineries" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338133i3E1007F9BCD3885F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1762793588729.png" alt="Fictional Organization - Mike Machineries" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Fictional Organization - Mike Machineries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Mike Machineries is a growing producer of high-quality coffee machines, headquarted in the United States with expanding operations in Europe.

Standardized workflows enable structured investigations and help define corrective and preventive actions. With SAP EHS in the Public Cloud, incident data becomes centrally, accessible, improving transparency, responsiveness, and cross-site collaboration (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/outlining-incident-management-1_ef89ce80-8b17-45af-b56a-6dbdba4495bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Incident Management - Business Process" style="width: 943px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338134iA57D7C13EBD2581F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_1-1762793735517.png" alt="Incident Management - Business Process" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Incident Management - Business Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;User Scenario (A) - Incident Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;During a routine maintenance task at the Mike Machineries production facility in Hamburg, an internal maintenance technician slipped on spilled oil near a coffee machine assembly unit and suffered a minor injury. A nearby colleague witnessed the incident and immediately reported the event in SAP EHS Public Cloud via the Initial Incident Entry.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As the Incident involved a workplace injury, a First Aider on site recorded the medical details in an Injury/Illness Log Entry. Based on these entries, the system automatically created an Incident Report and notified the responsible Incident Manager, who reviewed the information and initiated the incident process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As part of the investigation, relevant statements were collected, the work environment was assessed, and supporting evidence such as photos and maintenance instructions was documented. The root cause analysis revealed that the injury occurred due to an oil spill caused by a minor leak at the test station and insufficient signage during maintenance activities.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Corrective and preventive actions were defined, including immediate cleaning and leak repair, improved floor marking around the test station, and reinforcing safety instructions for technicians handling maintenance tasks. Once the actions were completed and validated, the Incident Manager finalized the documentation and completed the required reporting in SAP EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--146634000"&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.1.2 Risk Management&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Risk Management is a key element of proactive safety and environmental protection. SAP EHS provides tools to identify potential hazards, assess their severity and likelihood, and define appropriate mitigation measures. Using structured risk matrices and standardized assessment logic, organizations can continuously evaluate and minimize risks across their operations, strengthening safety awareness and accountability (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/analyzing-health-and-safety-management-1_fd18fc84-89dc-418e-b29a-1234b7c7370c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Operational Risk Assessment - Business Process" style="width: 943px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338135i46FCD233FBB958C3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_2-1762793905491.png" alt="Operational Risk Assessment - Business Process" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Operational Risk Assessment - Business Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;User Scenario (B) - Risk Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At Mike Machineries production facility in Stuttgart, a new industrial cleaning solvent named “Precision Parts Cleaning Solvent X42” was introduced for maintaining high-precision coffee machine components. During a routine safety walk, a supervisor noticed a strong chemical vapors in the maintenance area and observed that technicians were not consistently using the required personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling the solvent.

An Industrial Hygienist conducted the risk assessment, reviewing the solvent’s properties, exposure, risks, flammability, and current working conditions. Based on these factors, the inherent risk was classified as “high”, and several mitigation measures were defined including:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;improving ventilation in the chemical handling area,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;enforcing mandatory PPE usage for all employees handling the solvent,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;updating SDS documentation and conducting refresher training for technicians,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;implementing stricter storage and labelling requirements, and&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;arranging a follow-up with the supplier to explore safer substitute products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A Control Inspection was performed to verify the implementation of the safety measures. Once completed, the residual risk was reduced to “medium-to-low” and considered acceptable. The risk assessment was formally closed in SAP EHS Public Cloud. Key learnings and updated chemical-handling procedures were shared across all Mike Machineries sites to strengthen preventive safety practices.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--343147505"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.1.3 Emissions Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With Emissions Management, SAP EHS provides a comprehensive solution to record, calculate, and monitor environmental impacts such as air emissions, wastewater, or waste generation. Companies can track key environmental indicators, meet regulatory reporting requirements, and ensure ESG compliance with confidence. By integrating production and logistics data, emissions reporting becomes more accurate, consistent, and audit-ready (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/outlining-environment-management-1_c6c8d05d-66fd-4149-a580-6532b447ba0a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Emissions Management - Business Process" style="width: 943px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338136i4818121F3210AD88/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_3-1762794018117.png" alt="Emissions Management - Business Process" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Emissions Management - Business Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;User Scenario (C) - Emissions Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At the Mike Machineries production facility in Dublin, the Environmental Manager is responsible for ensuring compliance with local air emission regulations. One of the main emission sources on site is a gas-fired roasting unit used to treat metal components before assembly. The unit operates at a designated Functional Location and requires regular monitoring of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. To ensure compliance, the Environmental Manager prepared the annual emissions monitoring plan, including sampling intervals, measurement methods, and required documentation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An Environmental Technician carried out the data collection, sampling exhaust gases from the roasting unit and recording gas consumption and operating hours. The supplier-provided material data was included to support emission factor calculations. The Environmental Manager then calculated and aggregated the emissions data in SAP EHS Public Cloud. During data monitoring, a deviation was identified: the recorded NOx emissions exceeded the permitted limit for the quarter.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An investigation was initiated to determine the cause of the deviation, revealing that a burner component had degraded over time, reducing combustion efficiency. A Corrective Action Plan was defined, including:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;replacing the defective burner component&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;requesting additional guidance from the supplier regarding optimal combustion settings,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;training operating staff to monitor early signs of inefficient combustion, and&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;updating maintenance schedules for more frequent inspections.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once the actions were completed and verified, a follow-up measurement confirmed that emissions had returned to compliant levels. The case was formally closed in SAP EHS Public Cloud. Key findings were shared with the Sustainability and Operations teams across all sites to support continuous improvement and maintain alignment with environmental objectives.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--539661010"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.1.4 Lessons Learned&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Based on the user scenarios A, B, and C, four core integrations play an essential role in enabling end-to-end EHS processes:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Human Resources (HR)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; – employee &amp;amp; organizational data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Business Partner (BP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;) – business entity information&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Material Management (MM)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; – material &amp;amp; product data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Plant Maintenance (PM)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; – technical objects such as Functional Locations &amp;amp; Equipment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The upcoming blog posts will focus on these four integration areas and demonstrate how SAP EHS Public Cloud can seamlessly embed into a hybrid SAP landscape.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--442771508"&gt;2.2 System Landscape&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To successfully integrate SAP EHS Public Cloud into an existing SAP environment, it is essential to understand the current system landscape and define a clear architecture. A well-designed setup ensures seamless data exchange, process consistency, and scalable integration that supports both cloud innovation and existing on-premise operations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--932688020"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.2.1 Current State&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These environments often run mature EHS capabilities such as incident tracking, risk assessments, and compliance reporting. As companies move toward more agile and innovation-driven operating models, many are now exploring hybrid landscapes that combine existing on-premise EHS processes with SAP EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This approach allows organizations to retain existing configurations and data while gradually adopting modern cloud capabilities – without disrupting operations. It provides a flexible transition path towards a scalable and future-ready EHS solution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To simulate this real-world scenario, we at Deloitte have built an integrated demo landscape that reflects a typical enterprise setup and supports the side-by-side integration of SAP EHS Public Cloud. The landscape includes the following key components:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Overview System Landscape" style="width: 542px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338137i467C4810EA40DCF1/image-dimensions/542x264/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="542" height="264" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_4-1762794461953.png" alt="Overview System Landscape" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Overview System Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is the core platform for SAP EHS. It provides standardized and continuously updated EHS capabilities for incident management, risk assessments, and emissions tracking – without the need for technical upgrades.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise remains the established backbone for many customers with existing ERP modules and processes. Integrating EHS Public Cloud side-by-side allows organizations to keep their current setup while gradually adopting cloud innovations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Master Data Governance (MDG)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP MDG ensures consistent, high-quality master data across the landscape. For EHS, MDG plays a key role in harmonizing Business Partner and Material data to support accurate reporting, risk assessments, and compliance processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP SuccessFactors&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP SuccessFactors provides the HR foundation for EHS. By integrating SuccessFactors with EHS Public Cloud, organizations can leverage employee and organizational data for incident reporting, safety roles, and occupational health-related processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) / SAP Integration Suite&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) provides the foundation for integration and extension in a side-by-side EHS scenario. Within BTP, the SAP Integration Suite enables secure data exchange between SAP EHS Public Cloud and existing SAP systems such as SAP S/4HANA On-Premise, SAP MDG, and SAP SuccessFactors. This setup ensures smooth interoperability in hybrid landscapes, supports process automation, and allows innovations through extensions and APIs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1129201525"&gt;2.2.2 Architectural Approach&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our demo landscape follows a side-by-side integration model that connects SAP EHS Public Cloud with existing SAP systems through&lt;/SPAN&gt; the SAP Integration Suite within the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). &lt;SPAN&gt;This architecture enables end-to-end EHS processes across cloud and on-premise environments, covering Incident Management, Risk Management, and Emissions Management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Architectural Approach" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338138iFAC9913C2059A15D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_5-1762794552191.png" alt="Architectural Approach" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Architectural Approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this setup, SAP EHS Public Cloud acts as the central application layer where the core EHS processes are executed. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Employee data is retrieved from SAP SuccessFactors through standard integration scenarios via SAP Integration Suite / Cloud Platform Integration (CPI), ensuring alignment of roles, responsibilities, and reporting hierarchies with SAP EHS Public Cloud. This supports consistent approval flows and clear accountability in EHS processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Foundational master data such as Business Partner and Material Master is governed in SAP Master Data Governance (MDG) and replicated to SAP EHS Public Cloud to ensure consistency of key business information across the landscape. For the MDG integration, organizations can use either IDoc or Web Service interfaces:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;IDoc-based integration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; is typically used for older SAP release versions or existing, established integration landscapes (generally prior to the SAP S/4HANA 2020 FPS02 release).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Web Service-based integration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; is considered best practice for more recent releases, offering a more flexible, scalable, and service-oriented data exchange approach (SAP S/4HANA 2020 FPS02 and onwards).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If additional mapping, transformation, or orchestration of API data is required, companies may optionally introduce the SAP Integration Suite / CPI as middleware. In our demo landscape, we implemented a direct Web Service integration between SAP MDG and SAP EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Technical objects, including Functional Location and Equipment, originate from SAP S/4HANA On-Premise (Plant Maintenance) and are integrated into the cloud using a customized iFlow via SAP Integration Suite / CPI as there is currently now standard interface available. This allows customers to reuse existing maintenance structures and align technical object data with EHS processes in the Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Overall, this side-by-side setup reflects a realistic enterprise architecture and demonstrates how SAP EHS Public Cloud can be embedded into an existing SAP system landscape without disruption – enabling scalability, transparency, and continuous innovation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1032312023"&gt;2.3 Prerequisites&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before integrating SAP EHS Public Cloud side-by-side with an existing SAP landscape, a number of technical and organizational prerequisites should be in place to ensure a smooth setup, secure connectivity, and reliable end-to-end process execution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1522228535"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.3.1 Technical Prerequisites&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The following components are required to enable a stable and secure integration setup:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) as the central foundation for integration and extension, providing services such as API Management, Event Mesh for even-driven communication, and hosting the SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Integration Suite – Cloud Platform Integration (CPI) subscription and configuration to support exchange between SAP S/4HANA On-Premise, SAP EHS Public Cloud, SAP MDG, and SAP SuccessFactors.

    <content>Dear Stanislaw, yes, the supplier in the return STO is company A. BUT in "shipping data" the Customer is company A as well! Just like in the original STO. And the Shipping Point is one of company A, too. Sounds wrong to me, or is it? Thank you Jens</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Team,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have activated anomaly prediction in SAP Focused Run and observed that the feature currently predicts SAP PERSON_NAME memory saturation and database hanging scenarios. Our questions are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Can anomaly prediction predict &amp;nbsp;SAP HANA&amp;nbsp; memory saturation &lt;STRONG&gt;12 hours in advance&lt;/STRONG&gt; and automatically trigger cache clearing?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is anomaly prediction limited to &amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;databases only&lt;/STRONG&gt;? Currently, we see it working only for PERSON_NAME. Is it possible to extend this to other databases such as &lt;STRONG&gt;Oracle, Sybase&lt;/STRONG&gt;, etc.?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We noticed that the available models are:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP HANA Out-of-Memory prediction&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP HANA Database Hanging detection&lt;BR /&gt;Are there any other predictive models available for non-HANA databases?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please confirm if additional models or functionality are planned or available, and advise on the recommended approach for automated remediation (e.g., cache clearing).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Learn more about the SAP Support user and program &lt;A target="_blank" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/maximizing-the-power-of-sap-community-at-product-support/ba-p/13501276"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/B&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. Can anomaly prediction predict SAP HANA memory saturation 12 hours in advance and automatically trigger cache clearing?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Prediction horizon: Out of the box, the delivered “SAP HANA Out-of-Memory prediction” model provides early warning for imminent memory saturation. The exact lead time (e.g., 12 hours) depends on data granularity, feature set, and the trained model’s configuration. Standard content does not guarantee a fixed 12‑hour horizon. If you need a specific horizon (like 12 hours), you can implement a custom model with that forecast window and integrate it via the &lt;STRONG&gt;PAS_MODEL_IMPL_BADI&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Refer to &lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/content/dam/support/en_us/library/ssp/alm/sap-solution-manager/focused-solutions/FRUN_Adding_Custom_Models_to_System_Anomaly_Prediction_200FP00.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://support.sap.com/content/dam/support/en_us/library/ssp/alm/sap-solution-manager/focused-solutions/FRUN_Adding_Custom_Models_to_System_Anomaly_Prediction_200FP00.pdf&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automatic remediation (cache clearing): Focused Run’s anomaly prediction itself does not execute corrective actions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Is anomaly prediction limited to SAP HANA databases only? Can it be extended to Oracle, Sybase, etc.?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Not limited to HANA: System Anomaly Prediction is model-driven. The delivered examples are HANA-focused, but the framework is database-agnostic.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to extend: You can train and deploy your own Keras-based models for any monitored system (Oracle, SAP ASE/Sybase, DB2, SQL Server, etc.) and integrate them via the enhancement spot/BAdI PAS_MODEL_IMPL_BADI.&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You develop and train the model in your preferred Keras environment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Package and register it following SAP’s guide “Adding Custom Models to System Anomaly Prediction” for Focused Run (see PDF).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensure the required telemetry (metrics/logs) from the target DB is available in Focused Run so the model has the right inputs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3. Besides “SAP HANA Out-of-Memory prediction” and “SAP HANA Database Hanging detection,” are there other predictive models for non-HANA databases?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Delivered content today: The standard, shipped models you cited are HANA-specific. SAP has not published additional out-of-the-box predictive models for non‑HANA DBs in Focused Run.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Custom options: You can create your own non‑HANA predictive models (e.g., Oracle tablespace exhaustion, buffer cache pressure, log file switch anomalies, ASE metadata cache pressure, connection storm detection, etc.) and integrate them through PAS_MODEL_IMPL_BADI as documented in the guide.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Practical considerations for custom models:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Identify and collect the right KPIs (e.g., memory usage by component, cache hit ratios, waits/latches, active sessions, log write rates).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Define the prediction horizon and acceptable false positive rate.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Implement model health checks, retraining cadence, and drift monitoring.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Map model outputs to alerts and, if desired, to automated remediation workflows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;To securely manage user logins and permissions across SAP and non-SAP systems, the best approach is to centralize identity and access management (IAM) and enforce consistent security policies. Here’s a breakdown:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Centralized Identity Management:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use an Identity Provider (IdP) like Azure AD, Okta, or SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS) to manage user identities in one place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;This allows single sign-on (SSO) across SAP and non-SAP systems, reducing password fatigue and improving security.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Define roles and permissions centrally, and map them to specific tasks rather than individual users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use tools like SAP GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) for SAP systems and integrate with your IAM solution for non-SAP systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enforce MFA for all critical systems to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. Automated Provisioning and De-Provisioning:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Integrate IAM with HR systems or employee lifecycle tools to automatically grant/revoke access when employees join, move, or leave the organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;This reduces the risk of orphaned accounts with lingering permissions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;5. Audit and Monitoring:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regularly audit user permissions and access logs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Implement automated alerts for unusual login activity or privilege escalations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;6. Data and System Segmentation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Limit cross-system access to only what’s necessary (principle of least privilege).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permission enforcement where possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Summary:&lt;BR /&gt;Centralize identity, enforce role-based access, automate provisioning, enable MFA, and monitor continuously. This approach keeps logins secure, simplifies administration, and ensures compliance across SAP and non-SAP systems.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m writing this blog to share the resolution of an issue I recently encountered in my project. I hope this post helps anyone facing a similar challenge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1893823809"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Issue Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Working Scenario:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are using &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Enterprise Portal&lt;/STRONG&gt; (with the &lt;STRONG&gt;HTTP&lt;/STRONG&gt; protocol) to fetch work items from an &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2023 Rise&lt;/STRONG&gt; system. The same approach also works with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP ECC&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application was functioning perfectly when both the portal and the backend systems were communicating over &lt;STRONG&gt;HTTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, with the connection established through a system alias in the portal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1697310304"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;When the Issue Started&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;As per &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Rise security guidelines&lt;/STRONG&gt;, direct &lt;STRONG&gt;HTTP access&lt;/STRONG&gt; to the S/4HANA system was disabled. Consequently, we switched both our &lt;STRONG&gt;portal&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;load balancer&lt;/STRONG&gt; configurations to use &lt;STRONG&gt;HTTPS&lt;/STRONG&gt; to ensure secure communication with the backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After implementing HTTPS, we tested the &lt;STRONG&gt;UWL (Universal Worklist)&lt;/STRONG&gt; functionality. However, instead of loading the work items, the page appeared &lt;STRONG&gt;blank&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and the &lt;STRONG&gt;browser console&lt;/STRONG&gt; displayed a &lt;STRONG&gt;mixed content error&lt;/STRONG&gt; — this happened because the portal (served via HTTPS) was attempting to load the UWL iView using &lt;STRONG&gt;HTTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(Please refer to the attached browser console screenshot for reference.) (&lt;STRONG&gt;Mix Content error in Browser Console for UWL in HTTPS.JPG&lt;/STRONG&gt;)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1500796799"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;After reviewing several blogs and SAP Community posts, I found an SAP Knowledge Base Article (KBA) that provided the crucial insight:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP KBA:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1927272" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1927272 - How to configure proxy mapping for external access through reverse proxy server&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to this KBA, we needed to update the &lt;STRONG&gt;ProxyMappings&lt;/STRONG&gt; parameter in the &lt;STRONG&gt;NetWeaver Administrator (NWA)&lt;/STRONG&gt; of the SAP Enterprise Portal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1304283294"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resolution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To resolve the issue, we made the following configuration change in the NWA:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Previous Value:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;ProxyMappings: &amp;lt;Blank&amp;gt;&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Updated Value: PFA (Updated Value of ProxyMappings.JPG)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;ProxyMappings: 52000=(Host:waslservices.wasl.ae,Port:443,Scheme:https,Override:true)&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;After applying this change, we &lt;STRONG&gt;restarted all application servers (one by one)&lt;/STRONG&gt; to ensure the new settings took effect.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the restart was complete, the &lt;STRONG&gt;ESS application navigation&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;UWL functionality&lt;/STRONG&gt; started working correctly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1107769789"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The issue occurred due to recent browser security updates affecting how mixed content is handled in portal navigation. By adjusting the &lt;STRONG&gt;ProxyMappings&lt;/STRONG&gt; parameter as per SAP KBA &lt;STRONG&gt;1927272&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we were able to resolve the problem successfully.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this solution helps others who encounter similar HTTPS-related issues in their SAP environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Best regards,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rohit Gera&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Effectively managing user logins and permissions across both SAP and non-SAP systems requires a centralized identity and access management (IAM) strategy. Implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) and leveraging protocols like SAML or OAuth can streamline authentication, while role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users have appropriate permissions. Integrating SAP’s Identity Management (IDM) with your broader IAM framework can help maintain consistency, enforce security policies, and simplify auditing across heterogeneous systems.</content>

    <content>Great question, Suheb! Managing user logins and permissions across multiple SAP and non-SAP systems requires a combination of identity management, access control policies, and secure authentication practices. Here are some best practices: 1. Centralize Identity Management Single Sign-On (SSO): Implement SSO using protocols like SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, or OpenID Connect so users authenticate once to access multiple systems, including SAP, AWS, Azure, and other cloud services. Identity Providers (IdP): Use a centralized IdP like Azure AD, Okta, or SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS) to manage all user credentials, reducing password fatigue and improving security. 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Define roles based on job function, department, or project and assign permissions accordingly. In SAP, leverage authorization objects and composite roles to control access to transactions, reports, and data. For non-SAP systems, map roles to IAM policies in AWS, Azure RBAC, or Google Cloud IAM. 3. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Require MFA for all sensitive systems. Many IdPs can enforce MFA consistently across SAP and cloud platforms, improving security without adding friction. 4. Automate Provisioning &amp;amp; De-Provisioning Use tools like SAP Identity Management (SAP IDM), Azure AD Connect, or Okta Lifecycle Management to automatically create, update, or deactivate accounts based on HR system data. Automation ensures access is granted only when needed and revoked promptly when employees leave or change roles. 5. Monitor &amp;amp; Audit Access Regularly review user activity and permissions. Enable logging and alerts for critical actions in both SAP and cloud platforms. Tools like SAP GRC Access Control or Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) can help detect anomalies. 6. Adopt Zero Trust Principles Verify users and devices for every request, even within the corporate network. Implement least-privilege access, giving users only the permissions they need to perform their tasks.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there a way to access or fill data in the Journal Entry XML data source (from either Ledger or Items)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s what I’m trying to do:&lt;BR /&gt;I create a Vendor Payment using &lt;STRONG&gt;Post Outgoing Payments&lt;/STRONG&gt;. After that, it links to &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Outgoing Checks&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where the PaymentDocuement&amp;nbsp;is connected to the AccountingDocument&amp;nbsp;from the Journal Entry created during posting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I want to know if it’s possible to automatically copy the &lt;STRONG&gt;check number&lt;/STRONG&gt; from the Outgoing Check to the Journal Entry Item. Once that value is available, I’ll use it to preview the PDF in &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Journal Entries&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Document Type “KZ”) and then click &lt;STRONG&gt;Create Correspondence&lt;/STRONG&gt; to view the PDF report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Oliver&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2177874"&gt;@theodore_abitbol&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks for your question! Normally, you consider SAP Cloud Transport Management service as central shared service that allows you to control the delivery towards production across your cloud landscape and use cases. So, recommendation would be to run it centrally, such as on a central subaccount for shared services. Technically, this is not a must, it could also run on any other subaccount. It is recommended to not run it on a development subaccount, as it requires destinations to the corresponding production environments, to which you normally want to restrict access.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery, the recommendation is to run it on a team subaccount, to make sure that the credentials securely stored inside the service are only for team resources (that is, that one team does not get access to the credentials from other teams/scenarios).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For general best practices on where to run SAP BTP services, you could check the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-admin-guide/sharing-btp-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sharing SAP BTP Services | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;section of the SAP BTP Administrator's Guide.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this helps!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Boris&lt;/P&gt;</content>

However, from my experience, runtime structure extensions are not part of that process. So, yes, it is a restriction to that business context because direct runtime extension of EWM warehouse request is not supported.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To use the field in BAdIs or logic, you may consider using a Custom Business Object or Customs CDS View that is joined with TOR_ID.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
