    <content>&lt;P&gt;We are using Asset Manager 2405. We cannot switch between 2 users on 1 device when the device is not connected to the internet. Both users finished onboarding + init sync. But can not switch users without an internet connection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is it possible to change the behaviour so users do not have to be connected to the internet when a user wants to check tasks assigned to him? I have checked the source code of SAM 2405, and I have found functions like InitializeOnUserSwitch, where I can remove actions like UploadOfflineData.action, but I do not know if it helps (is it a good idea?).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Only a connected user to the internet can access data - is it SAP MDK feature or just SAP SAM feature, and can it be changed?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>We checked the above points with our SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud consultant, but we are still not able to close this issue. During invoice posting (Supplier Invoice App / MIRO equivalent), the branch vendor is still getting replaced with the HO vendor, which is impacting GST reporting and vendor aging. If possible, could you please share any screenshots, step-by-step configuration guide, or documentation related to: Supplier BP → Company Code → Payment Transactions (specifically where “Always use alternative payee” or “Payee in document” affects FI posting) Supplier Partner Determination settings for PI / Invoicing Party in Public Cloud How PO Partner functions influence vendor substitution during invoice posting Any Public Cloud–specific restrictions or recommended setup for “HO as alternative payee only at payment time” without replacing the vendor during invoice entry We are using SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud and would really appreciate visual examples (screenshots) to ensure the setup is done correctly. This will help us guide our internal consultant and finally close this topic. Thank you in advance.</content>

    <content>We checked all the suggested points with our SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud consultant, but the issue is still not resolved. During invoice posting, the branch vendor continues to be replaced with the HO vendor. Could you please share screenshots or a short step-by-step configuration guide (BP → Payment Transactions, Partner Determination, and PO Partner setup) so we can validate our settings correctly in Public Cloud? This will help us close the topic.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We just concluded this year's SAP TechEd with two very insightful in-person events – SAP TechEd 2025 in Berlin (Nov 4–5) and SAP TechEd on Tour Bangalore (Nov 25–26). As depicted in the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-teched-blog-posts/sap-teched-2025-go-mobile/ba-p/14223700" target="_blank"&gt;announcement blog post&lt;/A&gt; of my colleague &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/165819" target="_blank"&gt;Thilo Berndt&lt;/A&gt;, the mobile topics were again very well covered in various sessions and activities. As part of which, we were conducting a Hands-on Workshop both in Berlin and Bangalore called "&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1749126071945001BoPB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CA260&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Learn how to build your own app and use it in SAP Mobile Start", which we would like to recap in this blog post and highlight the most interesting technical aspects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1765516461"&gt;Overview&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Mobile+Start/pd-p/73554900100800003452" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="709-1"&gt;SAP Mobile Start&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the native entry point to the SAP Business Suite, to&amp;nbsp;all relevant business processes, data, and content. It provides access to native or web-responsive business apps along with other content and critical business information. This includes notifications and consolidated views on tasks, approval workflows, and SAP S/4HANA situations. SAP Mobile Start provides business information from SAP Start, SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition, and SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition. Non SAP content can be integrated as well.&amp;nbsp;It runs on iOS, iPadOS and Android devices, on watchOS and Wear OS devices, and on Apple Vision &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While one significant aspect of SAP Mobile Start is to provide access to SAP’s role-specific standard content, such as business applications and tiles exposed from SAP S/4HANA via SAP Build Work Zone, this year’s SAP TechEd Hands-On Workshop CA260 centered on the ease of building pro-code extensions using SAP Build and specifically SAP Build Code with the &lt;A href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)&lt;/A&gt;. Participants were able to experience the necessary steps in building and deploying such a pro-code extension, as well as how to specifically utilize mobile native capabilities within that extension, such as Widgets (e.g. on the iOS Home and Lockscreen) and (Push) Notifications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The session material and exercises are available on Github within the repository &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260&lt;/A&gt;. We do highly recommend checking out the exercises and trying them out on your own development system environment. This blog post will provide a brief overview of the most important steps and technical activities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Please note that the session material on Github as well as some screenshots and code snippets in this blog post will contain usages of "###" as a placeholder for the participant number that was assigned in the hands-on workshop. Participants were instructed to replace these occurrences with their own participant number.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569002956"&gt;Building and Deploying the base version of the extension&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The exercises started by building and deploying an initial version of the extension that the workshop is using as an example. As the initial version provided to participants, we are using a &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;slightly modified version&lt;/A&gt; of the &lt;A href="https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;"Incidents Management" CAP sample application&lt;/A&gt;. The provided full-stack application and its dependencies are defined in the &lt;EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/multitarget-applications-in-cloud-foundry-environment?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Multitarget Application&lt;/A&gt; descriptor &lt;/EM&gt;(&lt;SPAN&gt;mta.yaml) which is being built and packaged into an&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;mta archive&lt;/EM&gt; (.mtar) during the build operation, which eventually gets deployed to the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), specifically SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment.&amp;nbsp;While the workshop is making use of SAP Build Code and its productivity tooling for developing full-stack applications with CAP, building the MTA project and deploying the build artifact to the SAP BTP, you can as well use your IDE of choice such as Visual Studio Code.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot: Overview of the project structure" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342722i6849CB3A68BC6173/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="extension_project_overview.png" alt="Screenshot: Overview of the project structure" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Screenshot: Overview of the project structure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;With the deployment, the CAP application (in terms of the server logic) is running an application container on the Cloud Foundry Runtime. The UI of our full-stack application is realized using SAP Fiori Elements, which is generating the User Interface based on standard floorpans and UI annotations as part of the service definitions using CDS. The Fiori frontend application lives within the HTML5 Repository of the SAP BTP. While this would already be sufficient to expose our extension to SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start as an application tile and run the frontend within the shell of SAP Build Work Zone using its managed Approuter, we want to have more control over the visual representation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Frontend deployed to the HTML5 Repository; backend application deployed to Cloud Foundry" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342739i89B76E31488996CD/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="deployed_applications.png" alt="Frontend deployed to the HTML5 Repository; backend application deployed to Cloud Foundry" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Frontend deployed to the HTML5 Repository; backend application deployed to Cloud Foundry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can achieve this greater control by leveraging SAP Build Work Zone's content definition format – the Common Data Model (CDM). The definition of which is documented &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-standard-edition/sap-build-work-zone-standard-edition/creating-cdm-json-file-for-multi-tenancy-html5-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;here&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; and represents a standardized data structure for defining business apps, their visual representation, the required roles, and the logical hierarchical structure in which business apps shall be organized using a concept called "Spaces &amp;amp; Pages". Such CDM structure can be supplied to the HTML5 Repository during deployment of our extension. In the workshop's repository, this definition resides in the &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260/blob/main/workzone/cdm.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/workzone/cdm.json&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; file.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1372489451"&gt;Integrating the app into SAP Build Work Zone &amp;amp; SAP Mobile Start&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;For integrating our extension into SAP Build Work Zone, which makes it automatically available to SAP Mobile Start, we leverage a relatively new feature of the SAP Build Work Zone Channel Manager – defining a HTML5 Business Solution. While we could also create a regular Content Provider, using the new Content Channel type "HTML5 Business Solution" further simplifies the process as we are not required to manage any design-time destination. The HTML5 repository is merging all deployed HTML5 applications and their CDM definition from a common "Business Solution", making it available for selection as a joint Content Channel by the "Business Solution" dropdown.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Creation of a HTML5 Business Solution Content Channel in SAP Build Work Zone" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342743i634E50FB1F827F2F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="html5_business_solution.png" alt="Creation of a HTML5 Business Solution Content Channel in SAP Build Work Zone" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Creation of a HTML5 Business Solution Content Channel in SAP Build Work Zone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This value used for merging multiple HTML5 application belonging to the same business solution is done via a dedicated property ("service" under "sap.cloud") in the web applications &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260/blob/5f3af51ea6dbd082d32feea936347d3751aaa6f0/app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json#L151" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;manifest.json&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;If you want to read more about HTML5 Content Consumption capabilities of SAP Build Work Zone, we can recommend &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/simplifying-html5-content-consumption-across-subaccounts/ba-p/13758568" target="_self"&gt;this excellent blog post&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;from our colleague Rupam who is part of the SAP Build Work Zone team.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;After adding the Content Channel's role to our Site and making sure we have the role assigned to our desired users, we can see it exposed in SAP Build Work Zone using the browser as well as in SAP Mobile Start – Nice! As defined in the &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260/blob/main/workzone/cdm.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/workzone/cdm.json&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; file, the application tile of our built extension is placed onto a Page with the title "&lt;EM&gt;Apps from Participant CA260-000&lt;/EM&gt;", which itself is available under a Space named "&lt;EM&gt;Extensions from CA260&lt;/EM&gt;".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Deployed application visible in SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343000iBC49C8146D73D71F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="deployment_result.png" alt="Deployed application visible in SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Deployed application visible in SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175975946"&gt;Extending the app to make use of Widgets on your mobile device&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The steps to extend now our application in order for it to be configurable as a Widget, for example on the iOS Homescreen or the Lockscreen, are actually much easier than you might think. SAP Mobile Start offers multiple types of Widgets. The one we will be using here is the &lt;EM&gt;"Business Info Widget"&lt;/EM&gt;, which can be configured to display any KPI that is available to SAP Mobile Start. In technical terms this means that we need to enhance the application tile of our extension to become a&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;"Dynamic App Launcher"&lt;/EM&gt;. In the simplest case, these are tiles showing a number coming from a connected data service. In more complex scenarios, these can also display criticalities, trend and more information around the selected KPI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The process to transform our basic tile into a Dynamic App Launcher is fairly simple. Within our web application's &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260/blob/main/app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;manifest.json&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; file, we can add the required definition to make it such a dynamic tile and connect it to our OData service for incidents available in our CAP application. For our example, let's point to the OData count of incidents and filter for incidents that are not in status closed using the status_code property. The needed configuration resides within the inbound definition under the node "indicatorDataSource". In order to make this change visible on our environment, the updated version needs to be deployed and the Content Channel needs to be synced.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Transforming the application tile into a DynamicAppLauncher" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343010i27DEB795C6EA3A1D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="indicator_data_source.png" alt="Transforming the application tile into a DynamicAppLauncher" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Transforming the application tile into a DynamicAppLauncher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;As a result, our application now appears a KPI tile on our Site and in SAP Mobile Start and we can monitor the automatically updated value both inside of SAP Mobile Start – for example when accessing the Page or by adding the app into my favorites on the &lt;EM&gt;Start&lt;/EM&gt; tab of SAP Mobile Start. This fact allows us to configure the same Dynamic App Launcher tile as a Widget, for instance to our iPhone's Homescreen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Pro tip: Why not mirroring your iOS Widget of open incidents to your Mac or configure the same on your Apple Watch as a watch face complication?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="The Dynamic App Launcher tile appearing in SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343011i9A6A7383FB96B242/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="dynamic_app_launcher_tile.png" alt="The Dynamic App Launcher tile appearing in SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;The Dynamic App Launcher tile appearing in SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ex3_03_02-2.gif" style="width: 185px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343012i11E0DEFB1C8CA766/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="ex3_03_02-2.gif" alt="ex3_03_02-2.gif" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-979462441"&gt;Implementing our own (push) notifications&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's now go one step further and implement our own notifications from our CAP application. The beauty of the integration via SAP Build Work Zone and SAP's notification framework leveraging the SAP Alert Notification Service on BTP is, that such notifications will automatically appear on our SAP Build Work Zone Site in the browser, in SAP Mobile Start under the notification bell as well as be delivered as a mobile native push notification to the mobile devices on which you use SAP Mobile Start. That's a game changer for informing your users about a time critical situation directly from your pro-code extensions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For CAP based extensions, we can make use of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://github.com/cap-js/notifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;@cap-js/notifications&lt;/A&gt; plugin. The plugin communicates with the necessary APIs using a Destination that needs to be created in the SAP BTP Subaccount in which the application will run. By default it expects the name for the Destination to be &lt;FONT face="terminal,monaco"&gt;SAP_Notifications&lt;/FONT&gt; if not configured differently. The values for this Destination can be retrieved from the Settings of SAP Build Work Zone (Administrator role required).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For sending actual notification from our CAP service, we need to define our desired &lt;EM&gt;NotificationTypes&lt;/EM&gt; first in the &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260/blob/main/srv/notification-types.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;/srv/notification-types.json&lt;/A&gt;. These defined types represent the blueprint for the actual notifications to be sent. They include the texts for the actual notifications in all the languages that shall be supported with dedicated placeholders which will be filled when the notification is actually triggered in the service logic. Below you can see an example for such a type:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "NotificationTypeKey": "IncidentCreated",
    "NotificationTypeVersion": "1",
    "Templates": [
      {
        "Language": "en",
        "TemplatePublic": "New Incident created",
        "TemplateSensitive": "New incident created by {{customer}}",
        "TemplateGrouped": "Incident Status Update",
        "TemplateLanguage": "mustache",
        "Subtitle": "{{description}}"
      },
      {
        "Language": "de",
        "TemplatePublic": "Neuer Vorfall eingegangen",
        "TemplateSensitive": "Neuer Vorfall von {{customer}}",
        "TemplateGrouped": "Vorfall Status Änderungen",
        "TemplateLanguage": "mustache",
        "Subtitle": "{{description}}"
      }
    ]
  }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sending actual notification is fairly easy and can be done with very few lines of code. We first need to initialize the notifications plugin with&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="terminal,monaco"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;cds&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;connect&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;to&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;(&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;'notifications'&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;FONT face="terminal,monaco"&gt;)&lt;/FONT&gt;, which creates a handle &lt;SPAN&gt;with which we can send notifications later. Sending notifications can be done with the function &lt;FONT face="terminal,monaco"&gt;alert.notify&lt;/FONT&gt;. Here, we reference the desired NotificationType (defined before), recipients and further properties and data related to this specific notification we intend to send.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Coding used to send notification when incidents are created and closed." style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343045i813539843CD8ABE2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ex4_02_01.png" alt="Coding used to send notification when incidents are created and closed." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Coding used to send notification when incidents are created and closed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="notification.gif" style="width: 185px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343047i130B5A8EC60DD1FE/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="notification.gif" alt="notification.gif" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a result, we receive a push notification at the event of incident creation and closure. Already in the push notification displayed by the mobile operating system, we see the defined texts from our NotificationType with the specific values filled for the specific incident object. When tapping on this push notification, SAP Mobile Start shows the full notification in the dedicated area of the mobile app. Using "Open in Browser" brings us to this specific incident in our SAP Fiori Elements application where we could take further action. This is achieved by supplying the &lt;EM&gt;Intent Based Navigation&lt;/EM&gt; (IBN) information of our app – consisting of the &lt;EM&gt;Semantic Object and Action&lt;/EM&gt; defined in our &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260/blob/5f3af51ea6dbd082d32feea936347d3751aaa6f0/app/incidents/webapp/manifest.json#L30" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;web application's manifest&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;. This allows SAP Mobile Start and SAP Build Work Zone to open the right application as a navigation target from the exposed content – in our case, the SAP Fiori Elements application running the HTML5 Repository and exposed to SAP Build Work Zone using the HTML5 Business Solution Content Channel.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;The deep link to the specific incident object is achieved by supplying a special navigation target parameter that SAP Fiori Elements supports for opening the desired "Inner App Route" – in our example, the Object Page of a specific incident using its ID. Feel free to check out how this was done for this specific example in the &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260/blob/5f3af51ea6dbd082d32feea936347d3751aaa6f0/srv/services.js#L98C1-L107C7" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;repositories' code&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="The notification details visible in SAP Mobile Start and the deep-link navigation to the SAP Fiori Elements application" style="width: 399px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343056i738A8CCC9235AA6A/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="notification_deep_link.png" alt="The notification details visible in SAP Mobile Start and the deep-link navigation to the SAP Fiori Elements application" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;The notification details visible in SAP Mobile Start and the deep-link navigation to the SAP Fiori Elements application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-782948936"&gt;Outlook&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We hope we were able to show, how easy it is to create pro-code extensions, deploy them to the SAP BTP, integrate them into SAP Build Work Zone &amp;amp; SAP Mobile Start. The demonstrated examples of mobile native widgets and push notifications hopefully showed the ease of leveraging the mobile native device capabilities. Beyond the content of the CA260 Hands-On Workshop of SAP TechEd 2025, we would like to give you an outlook to what else would be possible with this basis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The beauty of using the HTML5 Business Solution Content Channel Exposure in SAP Build Work Zone is that we have the flexibility and feature set of the Common Data Model (CDM) available. We could further extend the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2025-CA260/blob/main/workzone/cdm.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/workzone/cdm.json&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; file to make use of even richer visualization capabilities – for example by defining a declarative &lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;UI Integration Card&lt;/A&gt;. Such cards allow to achieve UI richt micro-experiences right on the Page's structure, for example displaying a short list of incidents with the most important information to get a brief overview as a processor. In the browser when consuming the page via SAP Build Work Zone, the card is rendered as a regular SAP UI5 UI Integration Card. In SAP Mobile Start, declarative cards are supported as mobile native UI elements. With a single declarative definition of such a card using the UI Integration Card framework, we can achieve native cross-platform support with a high quality user experience directly within SAP Mobile Start.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Having a UI Integration Card added to the Page in SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343097i28691EA750258654/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ui_integration_card.png" alt="Having a UI Integration Card added to the Page in SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Having a UI Integration Card added to the Page in SAP Build Work Zone and SAP Mobile Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For further information on SAP Mobile Start related features and topics, please check our &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/mobile-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Mobile Start documentation&lt;/A&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Good documentation grows faster and better when users and authors work together. That’s exactly the spirit behind the initiative we started some time ago by opening the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/identity-authentication-opens-its-documentation-for-your-feedback-with/ba-p/13536826" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services documentation to community feedback via GitHub&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your questions, issues, and edits have directly helped us improve the documentation and shape Cloud Identity Services for the community. Please continue to share your experiences — whether it’s a quick correction, a clarification, or a new example — every contribution helps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why this matters for Cloud Identity Services users and authors:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Faster fixes and clearer guidance: When you report unclear wording or missing information, we - the authors can respond and update docs more quickly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Direct collaboration: Instead of waiting for a support ticket or guessing, you can open a conversation right where the documentation lives.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Learn and contribute: Submitting edits is a great way to share real-world tips or correct examples that help everyone.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you! and keep the feedback coming.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But how to do that?

They are not eligible for workflow because ERS postings are automatically created from the system as documents. Due to its clean-core principle, public cloud also does not provide and configuration, BAdI or extensibility option that adds workflow support.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I suggest you use situation handling or central monitoring apps if you require governance on ERS.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let me know if you have further questions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Team&lt;BR /&gt;we are working on a conversion project. The client has given us the go-ahead to carry out the downtime phase starting on 31/12/2025, so the preparation check will be closed on 21/12/2025, closing the previous financial year, which would be 2024. I wonder if there are any issues with the migration date, which will be 2 January 2026. Logically, since the downtime phase will begin on 31 December 2025, there will be no open accounting periods in 2026?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;When we try to execute the transfer using the standard app, we receive the error:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;FAA_POST303 – “Transfer not possible as company code XXXX and YYYY are in different countries/regions.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I checked the available documentation and could not find any explicit SAP Note or official statement confirming whether cross-country intercompany asset transfers are supported or not in Public Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Olá,&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Como realizar a configuração de uma variante via SHD0 para a transação IH01.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;No cenário atual a IH01 está configurada como obrigatório o preenchimento do campo local de instalação, impossibilitando fazer a criação da variante SHD0.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Entendo que será necessário realizar os seguintes passos:&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;1 - Remover obrigatoriedade do campo local de instalação, devido o ambiente DEV não ter registro.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;2 - Configurar a variante na SHD0 e ativar ela como variante padrão para o sistema em PRD.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Atual:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Vanzuita_0-1764255115913.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345976iE36925D6FA95CA01/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Vanzuita_0-1764255115913.png" alt="Vanzuita_0-1764255115913.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Proposto:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Vanzuita_1-1764255155555.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345977iB73AA3BB5EA1A6A0/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Vanzuita_1-1764255155555.png" alt="Vanzuita_1-1764255155555.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;we have to extend some entries in IMG, e.g. the valuation classes to implement the material account determination according our customers requirement. Ideally we can do it by using the same primary keys as we have on another SAP system the customers runs. There the primary keys are fully numeric. We have concerns to follow the same nomenclature in public cloud. Will IMG entries which don’t start with Z or Y be overwritten by future updates, in the case SAP will release new standard entries which are congruent to the entries we set up.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In on premise systems you can check through the delivery class of tables by yourself. There you can identify if the table is protected against SAP updates or if you have to protect your entries by using the Z/Y namespace.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Generally we want to prevent that updates will overwrite entries we will do when customize the system.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

The Schedule Warehouse Task Creation mechanism and the job-template behavior you saw with /SCWM/R_DLV_PDO_CREATE_WT_JT supports delivery types like outbound (PDO), but not posting change (SPC).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP even documents this limitation: Currently, it is not supported to create warehouse task for posting change (SPC) with app Schedule Warehouse Task Creation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3126148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3126148&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What you can do instead:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manual or mass creation via Warehouse Monitor: SAP recommended workaround is to use Warehouse Monitor to create WTs for posting change documents&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you need true scheduled/unattended WT creation for SPC in Publlic Cloud, raise an SAP incident / feature request and reference SAP Note 3126148&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dawid&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Luke, thanks for your feedback.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, we currently have the payslip service configured in the system, which allows us to view the payroll receipt in SuccessFactors. What we're now trying to investigate is the possibility of sending the stamped CFDI (Mexican payroll) to a custom portlet in SuccessFactors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have any further questions, please let me know so I can provide more context.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;we're using a Standard Value Help in our FPM app (V4 with RAP) with the Valuehelp annotation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1445379"&gt;@ui&lt;/a&gt;.selectionField: [{ position: 20 }]
     @EndUserText.label: 'Artikel'
     @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [{ 
        entity: { name: '/LUNEH/BC_CIP_SHLP_ARTICLE', element: 'Article' },
        additionalBinding: [{ localElement: 'StoreId', usage: #FILTER, element: 'StoreId' }]
     }]
     Article;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However we would like to create a custom Filter (Checkbox) in this Value Help. Is this possible?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Currently we are creating Custom filters like this:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/5fb9f57fcf12401bbe39a635e9a32a4e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/5fb9f57fcf12401bbe39a635e9a32a4e&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;But I do not see a way to apply this to the Value Help. Any input is much appreciated!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;"&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An advanced mode parameter "setAuth" has been introduced. If this parameter is set to "true" in the advanced mode table, the basic authentication will be performed, when SSL is not enabled."- It says, if SSL option is enabled, then HTTP request will carry SSL attributes which will be accept at Destination service, If SSL option not enabled, then it will validate with Auth method which is added in advanced mode. Please make sure, the required certificates are updated in certificate and key repository&amp;gt; TrustedCAs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, It could be cause for internet proxy. So if the http request going outside network and if internet proxy need to use, then try enable the proxy with required details. It applies for secured network connection scenario.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope it will help.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Team, we are working on a conversion project. The client has given us the go-ahead to carry out the downtime phase starting on 31/12/2025, so the preparation check will be closed on 21/12/2025, closing the previous financial year, which would be 2024. I wonder if there are any issues with the migration date, which will be 2 January 2026. Logically, since the downtime phase will begin on 31 December 2025, there will be no open accounting periods in 2026, correct?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From time to time, we encounter situations where materials purchased for a project are received at the warehouse in the defined location (i.e., Storage Location 1). Instead of being delivered to the originally planned address, after a while, they need to be sent to another warehouse (Storage Location 2) for delivery to the customer site several days later.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I understand that these materials are being transferred from Storage Location 1 to 2 using a STO order, which is being generated with a manually created PR.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Do you know if there's a way to generate these PRs from the WBS (without duplicating the demand) and thus avoid the manual PR for the STO?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;Struggling to bridge the gap between your&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;non-SAP data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and your&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;— without creating costly data silos or duplicates?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;In this blog post, we demonstrate how SAP Databricks can efficiently extract semi-structured data like PDF invoices from an external&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;S3&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;bucket, derive some insights and share the results as a customer managed data product with SAP BDC using the zero-copy approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;This not only accelerates data-driven insights but also:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lowers storage costs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Simplifies your data landscape&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supports a framework for handling other semi-structured or unstructured data, which can be a common obstacle in data and analytics strategies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;This is high level how the architecture of the scenario looks like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span

The public cloud does not show IM/WM scenarios, which is why the prefix does not appear.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Below is a guidance on how you can make the serialisation procedure field appear.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;First, open the Manage Product Master Data app&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_0-1764257370325.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345987i2973D929043DEAE9/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_0-1764257370325.png" alt="Chris1973_0-1764257370325.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose your product and go to the Warehouse Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_1-1764257382514.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345988iA3C480F83B2841A3/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_1-1764257382514.png" alt="Chris1973_1-1764257382514.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Then click on create&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_2-1764257396006.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345989i281CA3A4CF03FC7E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_2-1764257396006.png" alt="Chris1973_2-1764257396006.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thereafter, maintain your Warehouse Number, Plant, Party Entitled to Dispose.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_3-1764257414824.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345990iF4A0B8D4309DED5F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_3-1764257414824.png" alt="Chris1973_3-1764257414824.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Save the product and the serialisation fields will appear.

    <content>There are no known fixes related to this assertion up to the current patch level. I would have expected a rebuild, which rebuilds the page layouts, would continue to encounter this issue . I would consider opening a support incident to investigate this. We would likely need the database as well as information to reproduce - support can provide guidance with identifying the problem statement(s).</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Community Stammtisch Berlin – Christmas Edition &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Christmas Market at Gendarmenmarkt | 16 December 2025 | 6:00 p.m.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hard to believe, but our unforgettable pre-TechEd Stammtisch kickoff at Hofbräuhaus was almost a month ago already. And we’re already heading into the next round – this time in a very different atmosphere: the smell of mulled wine instead of wheat beer, festive lights instead of beer hall lighting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We warmly invite you to a year-end &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Community Stammtisch&lt;/STRONG&gt; at the Christmas market at Gendarmenmarkt:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Meeting time:&lt;/STRONG&gt; 6:00 p.m.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Where:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In front of the entrance number 2 to the Christmas market at Gendarmenmarkt&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ezeugner_0-1764257955711.png" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345992i5B8DD6C0E0DFBA57/image-size/small/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="ezeugner_0-1764257955711.png" alt="ezeugner_0-1764257955711.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Who:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP experts and anyone who’s in the mood for exchange &amp;amp; networking&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;What to expect:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Networking&lt;/STRONG&gt; – meet people, catch up with familiar faces, and make new connections&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TechEd review&lt;/STRONG&gt; – what were your personal highlights of SAP TechEd 2025? What ideas are you taking into 2026 as inspiration?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Professional exchange in a relaxed setting&lt;/STRONG&gt; – from S/4HANA and BTP to Analytics, anything can be on the table&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Feel free to bring colleagues or community buddies – the more diverse the group, the more interesting the conversations. Our last meetup showed once again how many exciting people are part of the Berlin SAP Community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In a nutshell – event details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Date:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Tuesday, 16 December 2025&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Time:&lt;/STRONG&gt; from 6:00 p.m.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Location:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Christmas market at Berlin Gendarmenmarkt&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Focus:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP Community, exchange, networking&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Expenses are paid by each individual&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’d like to join, please register briefly so we can plan the group size.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’re looking forward to wrapping up the year with the SAP Community in Berlin – see you on 16 December! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":christmas_tree:"&gt;🎄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Community Stammtisch Berlin – Christmas Edition &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Weihnachtsmarkt Gendarmenmarkt | 16.12.2025 | 18:00 Uhr&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kaum zu glauben, aber unser unvergesslicher Vorabend-Stammtisch zum Kickoff der SAP TechEd im Hofbräuhaus ist schon fast wieder einen Monat her. Und schon geht’s direkt in die nächste Runde – diesmal in etwas anderer Atmosphäre: Der Duft von Glühwein statt Weißbier, Lichterglanz statt Brauhausbeleuchtung.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Wir laden dich herzlich ein zu einem Stammtisch zum Jahresausklang auf dem &lt;STRONG&gt;Weihnachtsmarkt am Gendarmenmarkt&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Treffpunkt:&lt;/STRONG&gt; 18:00 Uhr&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ort:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Vor dem Eingang 2 zum Weihnachtsmarkt am Gendarmenmarkt&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ezeugner_0-1764257955711.png" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345992i5B8DD6C0E0DFBA57/image-size/small/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="ezeugner_0-1764257955711.png" alt="ezeugner_0-1764257955711.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wer:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP Expert:innen &amp;amp; alle, die Lust auf Austausch haben&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Was dich erwartet:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Networking &lt;/STRONG&gt;– einfach ins Gespräch kommen, Leute wiedersehen, neue Kontakte knüpfen&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TechEd Review &lt;/STRONG&gt;– was waren deine persönlichen Highlights der SAP TechEd 2025? Was nimmst du dir für das Jahr 2026 als Inspiration mit?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fachlicher Austausch in entspannter Umgebung&lt;/STRONG&gt; – von S/4HANA über BTP bis Analytics, alles kann Thema sein&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bring gerne Kolleg:innen oder Community-Buddies mit – je bunter die Runde, desto spannender die Gespräche.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I have a TRM contract where a &lt;STRONG&gt;1110 (Reduction)&lt;/STRONG&gt; movement was manually posted with an incorrect amount. This movement has already been &lt;STRONG&gt;reversed in FI&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but it still appears normally in the &lt;STRONG&gt;cash flow within FTR_EDIT&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as if it were an active movement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I tried reversing it through the standard TRM transactions, but none of them detect this movement, and the position remains impacted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My question is:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How can I remove this 1110 movement from the TRM cash flow, since the FI reversal did not update the position in TRM?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I need to understand the correct procedure to make TRM reflect the reversal or remove this incorrect flow entry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Rabelo99_1-1764258252133.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345995i0694B7813F980629/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Rabelo99_1-1764258252133.png" alt="Rabelo99_1-1764258252133.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Billing documents adopt the billing date as the posting date and in your tenant the future period (December 2025) is not opened in SSCUI 102001. Therefore, the system requires a date earlier than 28.11.2025.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can resolve the issue by opening the corresponding future posting period. After the period is open, the system will accept your future billing dates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let me know if you have further questions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Team,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I got a requirment from business which is i got find to done with customization with the help of enhancement,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Purpose / Objective:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this Business requirment implementing a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) threshold limit configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;in SAP.&lt;BR /&gt;Currently, the system deducts TDS on every invoice amount without checking the cumulative transaction value for each vendor at PAN.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This leads to incorrect or non-compliant deductions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The objective of this development is to ensure that&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TDS is deducted only after the total transaction value for a PAN exceeds the statutory threshold limit (₹50,00,000)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;within a financial year.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business Requirement&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;TDS should be deducted only when the cumulative invoice/payment value for a vendor PAN in a financial year exceeds ₹50,00,000.&lt;BR /&gt;The system must check the total amount posted for each vendor PAN from the start of the fiscal year (April) and apply TDS only when the threshold is crossed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Functional Requirements:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="690"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="88"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TABLE&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="168"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Description&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="189"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;INPUT Logic.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FIELD&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="142"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OUTPUT&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="88"&gt;&lt;P&gt;LFA1&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="168"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fetch Vendor by Vendor PAN detail.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="189"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Vendor PAN&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104"&gt;&lt;P&gt;J_1IPANNO&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="142"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Vendor Code of same PAN&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="88"&gt;&lt;P&gt;LFBW&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="168"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Pass Vendor Code and get the vendor with withholding tax type 194Q-4Q&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="189"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Vendor Code which I got from LFA1(J_1IPANNO)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104"&gt;&lt;P&gt;WITHT&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="142"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Vendor Details which only have TDS type 194Q-4Q&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a Functional i have created the logic but i am confuged with from which table i can pick vendor invoice amount( which is final net amount after all kind of case which can reduce vendor invoice line item except vendor payment) I triend with BSEG, But BSEG is very big table, It will not work with BSEG. Please help me with the other solution other than BSEG, I avoid BSEG here, If only BSEG help here please give a clear logic. But provide any other solution.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Can we do this by Configuration level, According to me its cannot possible because at config level its just set the invoice base amount for tds deduction but validation required on cummulative vendors at PAN level also&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi together,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This behavior is actually by design in SAP Gateway for OData V2. When you create a Function Import in SEGW and assign the HTTP method POST, the return type cannot be a collection (0..n). It must be either None, Single Entity (1), or Nullable (0..1).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The reason is that POST is intended for operations that create or modify resources, and the OData V2 specification does not allow a POST Function Import to return multiple entities. If you try to define a return type with multiplicity 0..n, the framework will reject it, and you may encounter errors like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "fault": {
    "faultstring": "Received 405 Response without Allow Header",
    "detail": {
      "errorcode": "protocol.http.Response405WithoutAllowHeader"
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Return cardianlity: 1 or 0..1&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This is a limitation of the OData V2 protocol and the SAP Gateway implementation, not a bug.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Chris,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thank you for your input.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have reviewed the website links you provided. I visited each of them and read through the information carefully.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First of all, I would like to clarify that this is an invoice issued to a &lt;STRONG&gt;customer&lt;/STRONG&gt;, not a &lt;STRONG&gt;supplier&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as you mentioned in your comment.&lt;BR /&gt;Additionally, our integrations team and I attempted to use the BAdI referenced in the documentation, but we noticed that it still does not add the “paymentdetails” tag.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/c0c54048d35849128be8e872df5bea6d/8573b810511948c8a99c0672abc159aa.html?locale=es-ES&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/c0c54048d35849128be8e872df5bea6d/8573b810511948c8a99c0672abc159aa.html?locale=es-ES&amp;amp;version=LATEST&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Have you received any additional information regarding this case?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a reminder, my scenario involves issuing an invoice to a public entity, for which it is required to specify our own bank account details where the public entity should make the payment for the invoice uploaded to FACe.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Are you nervous when trying something new? I certainly am. No matter if we are talking about something simple like a new type of food, something more complex like a new travel destination, or even something that is going to impact my day-to-day life, like a new tool. What I do to try to minimize this feeling and really enjoy the experience is to research it and see what others are thinking and saying about it.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With that in mind, I want to help you enjoy your move from SAP Solution Manager to SAP Cloud ALM by answering &lt;STRONG&gt;5 frequently asked transition questions&lt;/STRONG&gt; and showing you how to use the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/roadmapviewer/group/1B9D1B79-D03B-42F6-937C-08DE7C252BB6/roadmapcontentpage/dbe443042b8f43d085c9e5e221bef757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Activate for Transition to SAP Cloud ALM&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; roadmap to your advantage.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have implemented the CTMS for my SAC. My CTMS is also used for BDC, CPI, GRDC and now SAC.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When i want to export with SAC, I only want the SAC node of my ctms to apear and nothing else. However, in the screenshot you can see, that i also see the other Nodes of my CTMS, but SAC Users should never export to the Datasphere Node of my CTMS for example.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How can i limit the permissions of user to only see the SAC node for export with ctms?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="noah_l_0-1764260721473.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346009i8CFACDAD7084AC1B/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="noah_l_0-1764260721473.png" alt="noah_l_0-1764260721473.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi there,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm not sure if this has been a common thread, but since the credential method change with S-ID's I've consistently had issues with signing into my various accounts. My solve has been to "forget password", which will work sometimes but other times, access to various systems is met with the same issue, even after changing passwords. In general, this approach has been inconsistent and seems unnecessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In general, I've found this change to be far less efficient than the old approach, where I could use my S-ID and select the system I wanted to interact with.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Jacob_Maga_0-1764261059236.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346010iA1DF810544D1799D/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Jacob_Maga_0-1764261059236.png" alt="Jacob_Maga_0-1764261059236.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In the previous performance assessment you could select to have the goal section expanded by default. This was our preference as it made it easy to see the additional goal details the comment box that we have for each goal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now in the latest performance assessment you have to click on every individual goal to see the comment box and we think most managers will miss this.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I don't see any option to 'expand' the goal section be default is it even possible?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Ah okay, you want to display the stamped CFDI after it has been returned from the SAT, assuming it is in HDL format. This should be possible as your integration middleware can pickup the HDL file, parse it, and send the information to a custom Generic Object that can be displayed on the employee's People Profile.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**Updated December 2025**&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Symptom&lt;/STRONG&gt;: You want to activate Object Store in SAP Datasphere, but you don't know how.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Highlights:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can create up to five spaces using the Object Store option.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Depending on your system, Object Store may take up to 1h to be available.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The deployment time for creating a file space can take some time (up to 45 min).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is currently no ability to enable Object Store for existing spaces; you need to create a new one, named file space.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Downsizing SAP HANA Storage is not possible. It is only viable via deletion and recreation of your SAP Datasphere tenant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is no limitation regarding data center and region availability for Object Store: it is available in all data centers that SAP Datasphere is available on.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Requirements&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensure you have at least 4151 Capacity Units (CU) for the tenant. For more information, click&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/what-is-the-minimum-capacity-units-cu-to-activate-object-store-in-sap/ba-p/14181475#:~:text=Resolution%3A%20The%20minimum%20capacity%20units,Data%20Cloud%20Capacity%20Unit%20Estimator." target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Confirm that you are the system owner or have the DW Cloud Administrator role assigned to proceed with this action.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure your SAP Datasphere tenant is on version 2021.03 or later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resolution:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Open&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;your SAP Datasphere,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;log in, and open the navigation bar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Select "&lt;EM&gt;System&lt;/EM&gt;", then click "&lt;EM&gt;Configuration&lt;/EM&gt;".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Go to the "&lt;EM&gt;Tenant Configuration&lt;/EM&gt;" tab.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. In the "&lt;EM&gt;Base Configuration&lt;/EM&gt;" card, select "&lt;EM&gt;Memory&lt;/EM&gt;" for Performance Class.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;5. Increase Memory to 128GB and Storage to 384GB.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;In the “&lt;EM&gt;Object Store&lt;/EM&gt;” card, set Storage to 1 GB, Compute to 1 Block-Hour, and Requests to 1,000 API Calls. If you need additional resources, feel free to adjust the Storage, Compute, and Requests values as needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;7. Click "&lt;EM&gt;Save&lt;/EM&gt;".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;8. Press "&lt;EM&gt;OK&lt;/EM&gt;" if you agree with all statements regarding this upgrade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;9. Wait 1h until Object Store is available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;10. Go to "&lt;EM&gt;Space Management&lt;/EM&gt;" and hit "&lt;EM&gt;Create&lt;/EM&gt;".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;11. Select "&lt;EM&gt;SAP HANA Data Lake Files&lt;/EM&gt;" in Storage Type and press "&lt;EM&gt;Create&lt;/EM&gt;".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;12. Now you have a space with Object Store enabled.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 01&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764249585202.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345950iD1933E77A407EEAF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FernandaFroelich_0-1764249585202.png" alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764249585202.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 2&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764255221175.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345978iEEF1DEEC78B2A020/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FernandaFroelich_0-1764255221175.png" alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764255221175.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 3&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764255536547.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345980iD7AF59761B58042E/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FernandaFroelich_0-1764255536547.png" alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764255536547.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 4&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764256219990.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345981i1EBF1A61A5BBD254/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FernandaFroelich_0-1764256219990.png" alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764256219990.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 05&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764262071545.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346012iFCCB58E5CA8EA1AC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FernandaFroelich_0-1764262071545.png" alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764262071545.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 06&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FernandaFroelich_1-1764262133122.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346013i38905589A72243AD/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FernandaFroelich_1-1764262133122.png" alt="FernandaFroelich_1-1764262133122.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 07&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764262613456.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346014i069BDC12DF550A76/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FernandaFroelich_0-1764262613456.png" alt="FernandaFroelich_0-1764262613456.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sources&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3525760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3525760 - Activation of object store in SAP Datasphere&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3538038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3538038 - Important considerations for SAP Datasphere object store&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3224686/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3224686 - How to scale down your SAP Datasphere tenant&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATASPHERE/9f804b8efa8043539289f42f372c4862/33f8ef4ec359409fb75925a68c23ebc3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Configure the Size of Your SAP Datasphere Tenant&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

You can extend the form by using a Custom CDS View that is based on API I_PurchaseOrderItemAPI01, then expose the tax fields through a Form Data Source Extension and bind them in the Adobe form. Your VAT summation and gross calculation must happen in XDP form logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go to the Custom CDS Views app&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_0-1764264338273.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346024i790D3CAE79C41E34/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_0-1764264338273.png" alt="Chris1973_0-1764264338273.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Create a new one.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chris1973_1-1764264349164.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346025i45FA86EC8E08842A/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Chris1973_1-1764264349164.png" alt="Chris1973_1-1764264349164.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Choose &lt;SPAN&gt;I_PurchaseOrderItemAPI01&lt;/SPAN&gt; as your primary data source.

Go to Maintain Form Template Data Source Extensions. Select MM_PUR_PO_OUTPUT, click Create Extension, add your Custom CDS View as an extension node: (Node name: ZPO_ITEM_TAX) and join PurchaseOrder + PurchaseOderItem. Then publish.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thereafter, go to Manage Form Templates app, Copy MM_PUR_PURCHASE_ORDER, download PDF, add fields under the item node: VAT per item, Net amount, Gross amount.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Next is to add your VAT summation in Adobe. Finally upload and activate your modified template back into Manage Form Templates and assign it to your MM_PUR_PO_OUTPUT and Channel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;For complex document types, and maybe even more tricky invoices, that's a case for SAP Document AI, where stable and secure outputs can be delivered from unstructured data such as lab results, certificate documents, supplier documents, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have two different inspection types. For the first one when I record defect on characteristic level (during results recording) system ask me to select Report type. When I do the same for second inspection types, system automatically select Report Type and catalog profile and I can't change them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any suggestions where to config that behavior?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi All,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have created Global account "&lt;SPAN&gt;def19557-89f7-4fee-b33e-9c26d1a9acd2" under cost&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;centre&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;101830049. In recent days, for testing provisioning flow, we changed it to&amp;nbsp;101039103.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It causing issue with tenant creation via URM. We raised a ticket to UCL team -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://jira.tools.sap/browse/NGPBUG-467218" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://jira.tools.sap/browse/NGPBUG-467218&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;They responded stated that cost centre change has not synced properly.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;UCL stores global accounts based on events from the CIS service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most of the events we received for the global account: "def19557-89f7-4fee-b33e-9c26d1a9acd2" contain the correct cost center: "101039103"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, there are 5-6 events that contain the wrong cost center (101830049) for the mentioned global account.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;{

		},&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;This leads to the override of the correct cost center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Can you help us in resolving the issue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

En el contexto de la transformación digital actual, la gestión de procesos es esencial para aumentar la eficiencia, calidad y agilidad en las organizaciones. Este hands-on busca cerrar la brecha entre el conocimiento teórico de BPM y la capacidad práctica para diseñar procesos bajo estándares profesionales.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Como parte de la Iniciativa Académica de SAP Signavio BPM, los participantes—compuestos por profesores y estudiantes—aprenderán a navegar y utilizar el SAP Signavio Process Collaboration Hub y a modelar procesos utilizando BPMN 2.0. No se requiere experiencia previa con SAP Signavio, ya que el hands-on ofrece una experiencia práctica y directa.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dirigido por Alfredo Armijos De La Cruz, con una vasta experiencia en gestión de proyectos y transformación empresarial, el taller abarcará desde la introducción a los conceptos fundamentales de BPM hasta el desarrollo en modelado práctico con casos reales. La aprobación se basará en la realización de quizzes y la práctica guiada dentro de la plataforma SAP Signavio Process Manager.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hora de inicio:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;09:00 AM (UTC-5)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Hora de finalización:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;01:00 PM (UTC-5)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1894802019"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;¡Bueno saberlo!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;¡La inscripción es GRATUITA!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Por favor, tenga en cuenta que no habrá una respuesta perfecta para cada pregunta/sección para todos los datos requeridos en el proceso de registro, ya que el sitio web/la tecnología que utilizamos es un sitio web de eventos universal de SAP. Le pedimos amablemente que elija la opción que mejor se adapte a usted.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Recomendamos seleccionar "Higher Education &amp;amp; Research" en el campo "Industry", "Partner" en el campo "Relationship with SAP" y "Delegate" en el campo "Function". La opción que elija no influirá en el estado de su registro.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Para completar tu registro, es necesario usar un correo académico o uno vinculado a una universidad.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;No dude en contactarnos con cualquier pregunta a través de&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="mailto:Universityalliances@sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Universityalliances@sap.com&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="6"&gt;¡Inscríbete &lt;A href="https://events.sap.com/lac-sap-signavio-workshop-2025/en_us/home.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;aquí&lt;/A&gt;!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I just discovered that TDD tenants can't be rewired at the moment.&lt;BR /&gt;This scenario is still in pipeline to be delivered.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;See &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3684354" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;KBA&amp;nbsp;3684354 -&amp;nbsp;Rewiring TDD tenants (SAP Datasphere and SAP Analytics Cloud) onto SAP Business Data Cloud&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Ismael&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Janarthan,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I don't have personal experience with this but did some research (Joule for Consultants) and sharing it on - alot seems rooted around the guidance from this blog as a starting point t validate proper setup:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/electronic-invoicing-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition/ba-p/13578774" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/electronic-invoicing-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition/ba-p/13578774&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;and I would guess you've already browsed the Belguin HELP documentation?&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/fba518519f834ed99011786d831ee504/2f9ab027fadc4a52bd2316d3b7e45223.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/fba518519f834ed99011786d831ee504/2f9ab027fadc4a52bd2316d3b7e45223.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;These were the joule recommendations though:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1765719359"&gt;Primary Diagnostic Steps&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Check eDocument Cockpit Status&lt;/STRONG&gt; Since you cannot access tables directly in Public Cloud, use the &lt;STRONG&gt;eDocument Cockpit&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Electronic Documents&lt;/STRONG&gt; app to check the document processing status. Look for any error messages in both the application log (content issues) and interface log (integration issues) - Tobias' blog:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/electronic-invoicing-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition/ba-p/13578774" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/electronic-invoicing-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition/ba-p/13578774&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Verify Belgium-Specific Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt; The Belgium eDocument implementation requires multiple configuration steps that must be properly implemented [2]. Key areas to verify include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scope Item Activation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Ensure scope item 5XU (SAP Document and Reporting Compliance) is activated in your system [1]&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Feature Activation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Activate Document and Reporting Compliance Features through Central Business Configuration (CBC) or Solution Builder [1]&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Party ID Type Assignment&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Confirm your Belgium company code is properly assigned to the BE:VAT party ID type&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Partner Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Verify the customer's Belgium VAT number is correctly assigned as a party ID type [1]&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;eDocument Type Mapping&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Check that your billing document type is properly mapped to the Belgium eDocument type (BE_INV for invoices, BE_CRE for credit memos)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Configuration Activities Review&lt;/STRONG&gt; Navigate through the following configuration sections [1]:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;General Settings for eDocument&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Review all general eDocument configuration activities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Belgium-Specific Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Check country-specific settings for Belgium electronic documents&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569205854"&gt;Common Root Causes in Public Cloud&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Value Mappings Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt; Most eDocument submission errors in Public Cloud relate to missing value mappings [1]. Use the &lt;STRONG&gt;Configure Value Mapping&lt;/STRONG&gt; app to verify:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigate to the Belgium namespace&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Check all required value mapping tables are properly maintained&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Note that value mappings are not transported and must be maintained separately in each system [1]&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Master Data Requirements&lt;/STRONG&gt; Verify required master data attributes on :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Partner&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Belgium VAT number properly maintained in identification tab&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Product Master&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Required classification codes for Belgium&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Integration Setup&lt;/STRONG&gt; For Belgium, you typically integrate with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, Cloud Edition or a third-party provider. Verify:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Communication arrangements are properly configured&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integration flows are active and functioning&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Service connectivity is established&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1372692349"&gt;Troubleshooting Process&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Review eDocument Cockpit&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Check for any processing errors or status indicators&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Validate Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Use the configuration activities to verify all Belgium-specific settings&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Check Value Mappings&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Ensure all required mappings are maintained for Belgium&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Verify Master Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Confirm VAT numbers and other required data are properly maintained&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Test Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Verify the connection to your eDocument service provider&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you've reviewed those sources and it's sitll not resolved, I'd recommend a ticket on component FI-LOC-CA-BE&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Is it possible to display the total amount of planned accruals for the year, on the time off UI (not the time off workbench)? This is so that employees know how much vacation they should expect to be earned in that year.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;The error occurs because the Calculation View parameter is being passed as a column reference instead of a literal value. input parameters must be supplied via PLACEHOLDER with &lt;U&gt;a quoted literal&lt;/U&gt;, for example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(PLACEHOLDER.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;"&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;$&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;$CTRY&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;$&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;$&lt;/SPAN&gt;" =&amp;gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;'{ p_land1 }'&lt;/SPAN&gt;) &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;After correcting the SQL string and quoting the parameter, the view executes without error.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Replace your SQL string&amp;nbsp;v_str = SELECT * FROM.........(PLACEHOLDER."$$CTRY$$" =&amp;gt; '{ p_land1 }') .&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Debug step will show&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;(PLACEHOLDER."$$CTRY$$" =&amp;gt; 'IN')&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</content>
