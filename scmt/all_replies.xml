    <content>&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;One year ago, Martin Häuser blogged about the newly released &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sapui5-meets-typescript-a-smooth-migration-journey-with-joule/ba-p/13958872" target="_self"&gt;JavaScript-to-TypeScript conversion feature of Joule&lt;/A&gt; in SAP Build. Now, with the new release 0.2.0, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/mcp-server" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;UI5 MCP server&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;has also received such a feature. Here I write about the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;experience&lt;/STRONG&gt; while validating the feature and give hints about&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;what to expect&lt;/STRONG&gt; and how to &lt;STRONG&gt;get the most out of it&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This article is for UI5 developers familiar with TypeScript basics who are considering converting existing JavaScript applications. If you want to check out the basics of MCP servers before continuing, read our initial &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/give-your-ai-agent-some-tools-introducing-the-ui5-mcp-server/ba-p/14200825" target="_self"&gt;release blog post.&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;For comprehensive UI5-specific TypeScript information see &lt;A href="https://ui5.github.io/typescript/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;this page&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Scroll down to the end of this article when you are only interested in the learnings and hints, without all the technical details of getting there and tweaking the feature.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766644736"&gt;Why convert existing apps to TypeScript?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Much has been written about the value, efficiency, and developer happiness&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;that comes with using TypeScript when writing UI5 applications. Don't take my word for it, just see &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/3-3-from-javascript-to-typescript-the-shocking-results-of-our-sapui5/ba-p/13984355" target="_self"&gt;this blog post&lt;/A&gt; for a real-world report of a team which migrated or &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/a-chatgpt-like-chat-app-built-with-modern-sap-technologies-cap-sapui5-part/ba-p/13556185#toc-hId-176111766" target="_self"&gt;this one&lt;/A&gt; for a similar opinion. Read how people "&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/embracing-typescript-in-sapui5-development/ba-p/13675744" target="_self"&gt;wouldn't go back for anything in the world&lt;/A&gt;" and "&lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sohail9744_sapui5-sapui5-fiori-activity-7325836838558990337-omJ_/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;won't go back&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;once you try it". Frankly, all feedback I heard was very positive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm often asked whether &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;all&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;UI5 applications should be changed to TypeScript. While I definitely recommend it for new apps, I usually answered that the migration effort for an existing app only pays off when a certain amount of future development or maintenance effort is expected to be spent on it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This equation has now shifted!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the newest feature of the UI5 MCP server, UI5-specific TypeScript conversion assistance is now available to AI coding agents, which means a powerful boost for such an endeavor. As part of development, I tested it with the most complex UI5 app I had written myself (14 controllers, 7 custom controls). It had grown for almost eight years to a state which made me shy away from TypeScript conversion even though it was sorely needed. The result of using the MCP server: I literally told a colleague that I was getting goosebumps as it was plowing through the code of this app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570131231"&gt;Experience from converting an app&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1502700445"&gt;The app&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have to start by saying that the app is not on GitHub and not open-source. It isn't suitable for end-users without personal support, and its setup requires experts. It's the kind of app you start writing just for yourself but turned out to be so useful that it was used to manage the speakers and sessions and agendas of the last &lt;A href="https://openui5.org/ui5con/archive.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;seven UI5con conferences&lt;/A&gt; we organized as well as the sibling conferences &lt;A href="https://recap-conf.dev/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;reCAP&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://hanatech.community/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;HANA Tech Con&lt;/A&gt;, the UI5cons in &lt;A href="https://openui5.org/ui5con/bengaluru2026/index.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;India&lt;/A&gt; and several "SAP Inside Track" events across Europe. So it's a productively used app that better doesn't break down.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You use it when you suggest session proposals (and the jury rates the proposals in this app), but at its heart, it looks like this for event admins:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AndreasKunz_0-1765544277502.png" style="width: 666px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351473i19F303ACDFBCD995/image-dimensions/666x289?v=v2" width="666" height="289" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_0-1765544277502.png" alt="AndreasKunz_0-1765544277502.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And it comes with a drag&amp;amp;drop agenda planner developed as custom controls (not much of an agenda there right now, as no UI5con is currently planned):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AndreasKunz_1-1765544438959.png" style="width: 664px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351475i4A46F53E1ADEF249/image-dimensions/664x299?v=v2" width="664" height="299" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_1-1765544438959.png" alt="AndreasKunz_1-1765544438959.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the time had come to give the new MCP server feature a real-life check and some fine-tuning, this app with its history and quirks was just the right choice.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1306186940"&gt;Using the app to validate the MCP server tool&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;As preparation, I had an AI agent look at all files of the project and create an "&lt;A href="https://agents.md/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;AGENTS.md&lt;/A&gt;" file summing up its functionality and how things are working. This is not required specifically for TypeScript conversion, but probably useful anyway when an agent works with a project, as it gets an overview without having to first look around every time it starts a task.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The prompt I then used to launch the conversion was:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;EM&gt;@/AGENTS.md Convert the SAPUI5 UI of this project to TypeScript.
&lt;BR /&gt;Use the MCP tool to get conversion guidelines. Ignore the tests for the time being.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;P&gt;By the way, I used &lt;A href="https://cline.bot/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Cline&lt;/A&gt; with Anthropic's Claude 4.5 Sonnet LLM, but it would work similarly with other LLMs and agents like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf,... I explicitly mentioned the MCP tool and added AGENTS.md in the prompt as references. Probably that's not needed, but when starting a task that may run for an hour and may save days of work, then requesting precisely what I want doesn't hurt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It started reasonably by calling the MCP tool and looking around in central project files like package.json, ui5.yaml and other top-level configuration files.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AndreasKunz_2-1765545373741.png" style="width: 417px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351477i11FBC05CA7456E1F/image-dimensions/417x523?v=v2" width="417" height="523" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_2-1765545373741.png" alt="AndreasKunz_2-1765545373741.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It then came up with a conversion plan—for the project setup in "phase 1", then for the concrete JS files.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AndreasKunz_0-1765548439531.png" style="width: 419px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351508iBD36DE67BDF69D38/image-dimensions/419x590?v=v2" width="419" height="590" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_0-1765548439531.png" alt="AndreasKunz_0-1765548439531.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AndreasKunz_1-1765548540598.png" style="width: 418px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351509i66AD5FC25EEF2CE1/image-dimensions/418x614?v=v2" width="418" height="614" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_1-1765548540598.png" alt="AndreasKunz_1-1765548540598.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These steps and this order make sense and this is no coincidence: of course the MCP tool suggests how to best proceed and what to do. The agent went through "phase 1" and "phase 2", then stopped with a summary of the achievements so far, so I asked it to proceed with the custom controls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Starting with central reuse modules on which the other files depend (in terms of TypeScript: depend on their typed APIs) is what I also suggest to humans doing the conversion. A half-converted project works just fine like this and allows working in several steps instead of one big-bang conversion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This message during the custom control conversion made me admire its coolness and understanding of the process:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AndreasKunz_5-1765546348935.png" style="width: 447px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351483i29829C237026A7AB/image-dimensions/447x161?v=v2" width="447" height="161" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_5-1765546348935.png" alt="AndreasKunz_5-1765546348935.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before converting the controllers, it again paused with a summary, but after a while, before the largest controller files, it explained that it could not continue like this due to a &lt;STRONG&gt;filled-up context window&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;— oops!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AndreasKunz_6-1765546587017.png" style="width: 444px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351484i46ECDEAECAF9D679/image-dimensions/444x495?v=v2" width="444" height="495" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_6-1765546587017.png" alt="AndreasKunz_6-1765546587017.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is something to keep in mind despite all the grace and wonders of AI agents: technically, they are still based on algorithms which predict the next part of a word from all the preceding words. The more conversation history there is, the more computationally complex (and expensive and to some degree slower) the response will be. Also: the fuller the context is, the less will this prediction be able to precisely take into account each single piece of the past conversation. Or in more human terms: it won't remember all details when it is flooded with too much unrelated stuff like contents of files which have already been converted. For sure, the AI coding agents apply clever measures to clean unneeded content from the context, but in general it makes sense to start from scratch when doing a different task, even when not being alerted like this. And in this case of &lt;EM&gt;one huge&lt;/EM&gt; task the agent itself had to remind me that it could no longer digest all that input.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In such a case, start a new conversation. I copied 1.) the original prompt, followed by 2.) a hint that the conversion has already started and 3.) the conversion status up to this point. It was luckily provided by the agent, but if not: simply ask for it. The new conversation resumed smoothly from the point where the old one ended.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1109673435"&gt;Iterating and refining the feature—getting better and better&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Remember, this was not a TypeScript conversion to get the job done, but one for validating the MCP tool! The real work just started when the agent declared the job done.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Result of the very first run:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The app immediately ran successfully, which was a good sign, but the tests wouldn't even start. This was due to the complex way how test data is supplied to the app. Can't blame the AI for that.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It used "&lt;EM&gt;as any&lt;/EM&gt;" casts way too often (more than 100 times). When converting an app, it might be reasonable at some places to get the first result done, but doing it too often undermines the type safety.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It did dozens of casts like "&lt;EM&gt;(this.byId("form") as unknown as {setVisible: (v: boolean) =&amp;gt; void}).setVisible(false);&lt;/EM&gt;" where it would first cast to &lt;EM&gt;unknown&lt;/EM&gt;, then to an object which had exactly the method that was called. Instead, it should have cast the retrieved control to either the base class &lt;EM&gt;sap.ui.core.Control&lt;/EM&gt; when sufficient, or should have checked the XMLView to find out what type of control exactly will come back.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It declared some new types in the beginning of files, but did so in isolation: in one file it declared the parts of the type needed in this file, in the next file it again declared this type, but other parts of it. Instead of defining the type once and complete in a central location and then re-using it in all files.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In particular, it declared the &lt;EM&gt;jQuery&lt;/EM&gt; type several times (it is directly used in the code of some controllers) instead of making sure the jQuery types are present from their own type definitions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The conversion guidelines tool in the MCP server was then tweaked to prevent these issues and the process was re-started. The number of "&lt;EM&gt;any&lt;/EM&gt;" casts for example was then drastically reduced and the strange "&lt;EM&gt;unknown&lt;/EM&gt;"-plus-custom-type casts mentioned above were completely gone. Of course this tweaking was an iterative process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In other iterations, it...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;...hallucinated a version of&amp;nbsp;@ui5/ts-interface-generator that doesn't exist at all.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;...did not do "&lt;EM&gt;npm install&lt;/EM&gt;" after adding the UI5 type definitions to package.json, but continued converting all the files saying that the type errors are expected and will go away when "npm install" is run (well, why don't you run it? Then you could verify whether the types &lt;EM&gt;really&lt;/EM&gt; work!).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;...called the&amp;nbsp;@ui5/ts-interface-generator in the root of the project despite having created an additional tsconfig.json in the "webapp" subfolder. This made the interface generator pick up the wrong tsconfig.json (the one for the server part of the application), so it didn't find any custom controls and didn't create the interfaces for them.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the fixes for these issues was adding code to the MCP tool which&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://github.com/UI5/mcp-server/pull/137/changes/e864ad8920217674af980ae75dc54ced10cde254#diff-f6b083370e60b6d7d2b47c25e3971fb1d8854b0d7b945dc45fe22859f2d2a8aeR76" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;fetches the actual latest version&lt;/A&gt; of the @ui5/ts-interface-generator at tool invocation time (like it was already done for the other dependencies).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Despite all the tweaking of the tool, working with LLMs always means &lt;STRONG&gt;working with probabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;! As sad as it is, you cannot expect such a tool to work 100% as expected, or to report a bug when it doesn't and get this bug then analyzed, understood, and fixed for good. You might even encounter the above issues again when using the tool and there is NO way we could ensure it won't ever happen again.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In one iteration, the agent even got on a bad track right from the start. It set up the tsconfig.json file in a weirdly wrong way, resulting in the UI5 types not being found. They were installed, they were there and referenced, but neither the agent nor I, I have to admit, understood why they weren't applied. After seeing the agent trying to solve the problem in truly strange ways, I aborted this conversion attempt. Remember the thing about LLM contexts: when there is too much weird and wrong content in the conversation history which influences every single token it spits out as the process continues, then it is sometimes better to re-start cleanly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-913159930"&gt;Remaining errors&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the agent declares the conversion done, there are often a few dozen TypeScript errors left. Sometimes, those are errors which are NOT thrown by the TypeScript transpiler, but only displayed by the code editor (in my case Microsoft VS Code), as they sometimes use different settings (maybe due to the different tsconfig.json files for different project parts in my case).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can ask the agent to work on those issues, but in my experience it will often not find good solutions for those, but rather take the "&lt;EM&gt;any&lt;/EM&gt;" type shortcut. Those issues are worth to look at manually. Sometimes they actually reveal bugs in the app or the UI5 types!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;One issue was a bug in the types of the &lt;EM&gt;sap.ui.core.XMLComposite&lt;/EM&gt; control which I &lt;A href="https://github.com/UI5/openui5/commit/4cf933d1f6511274af009ac58499160a617db814" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;then fixed&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Others were caused by a bug in my custom control using the 'hidden: true' setting for making aggregations private, when the correct setting is 'visibility: "hidden"'.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes—despite tool improvements—the specific event types of UI5 are not used, e.g. here it used "Event" instead of&amp;nbsp; "Route$PatternMatchedEvent" from the "sap/ui/core/routing/Route&lt;SPAN&gt;" module&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AndreasKunz_2-1765551512101.png" style="width: 539px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351556i53D5BBC97331D9FA/image-dimensions/539x39?v=v2" width="539" height="39" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_2-1765551512101.png" alt="AndreasKunz_2-1765551512101.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;But sometimes there are still application-dependent structures and property names left which are not in the UI5 type definitions and need their own custom type defined:&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AndreasKunz_3-1765551660878.png" style="width: 516px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351561i54B8E6237F0344E0/image-dimensions/516x40?v=v2" width="516" height="40" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_3-1765551660878.png" alt="AndreasKunz_3-1765551660878.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It also depends on the eslint settings whether remaining "any" casts are considered as errors - you could change the settings or find better types.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-716646425"&gt;How JavaScript-to-JavaScript comparison validates TypeScript&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;With large amounts of code converted and moved from a *.js to a *.ts file, it's hard for humans to review the result. You cannot easily diff them with a focus on actual logic—even though much of the code should still be the same. The structural changes are just too large.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But remember: in the end, the TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript during the build because this is what browsers execute! As TypeScript is basically just &lt;EM&gt;JavaScript plus types&lt;/EM&gt;, the pure logic of the transpilation result should be the same as it was before. In addition, the structural changes of proprietary UI5 class and module definition syntax to ECMAScript modules and classes will also be reverted. Hence, ideally the transpiled TypeScript should look pretty much like the original JavaScript—at least close enough to spot potential conversion problems much easier in an interpretable diff.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So you can use any diff tool to compare the build result of the TypeScript app with the original JavaScript sources. In my case, 14 of 39 files in total had a difference. Most differences were trivial, like "var" converted to "const", "function"s converted to arrow functions,&amp;nbsp;anonymous functions converted to named functions and "use strict" moved. Others introduced additional null checks or other changes related to the stricter typing. In some places the "&lt;SPAN&gt;_interopRequireDefault&lt;/SPAN&gt;" function dealing with module exports was added.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One surprise was that the converted controls had also their control renderer migrated from the old string-based APIs like&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;renderer: function (oRm, oControl) {&lt;BR /&gt;
   oRm.write('&amp;lt;div');&lt;BR /&gt;
   oRm.writeControlData(oControl);&lt;BR /&gt;   ...&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;to renderer version 2 with semantic rendering:&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;renderer: {&lt;BR /&gt;
   apiVersion: 2,&lt;BR /&gt;
   render: function (oRm, oControl) {&lt;BR /&gt;
      oRm.openStart('div', oControl);&lt;BR /&gt;
      ...&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;I hadn't asked for that, but won't complain, as the resulting renderer was correct.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;Another functional difference was fixing the display of a regular expression in an error message. Nice, thanks!&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;But the most important result was that no change indicated broken or really changed functionality.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-520132920"&gt;The actual value (and cost)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Despite of all this talk about errors and issues, the conversion is a process that takes maybe an hour with an AI agent (plus a few hours of manual polishing afterwards), but would have taken days when done manually. And potentially saves many days of work down the road as TypeScript greatly helps with development and maintenance efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Speaking of value, there is also monetary cost involved. A potential license fee of the AI agent tool itself might already include some or all of the AI tokens consumed by the conversion process. But to give an example for the imaginary isolated token cost, the conversion of this 14-controller-7-controls app consumed about &lt;STRONG&gt;16 million input tokens&lt;/STRONG&gt; (oops!) and (only!) &lt;STRONG&gt;90k output tokens&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using the current&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;end-user API pricing&lt;/A&gt; of Anthropic ($3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens) this sums up to about $50, which is likely not the biggest cost factor considering the invested (and saved!) working hours. Of course different models have different costs—and results. Google's &lt;A href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing?hl=de#gemini-2.5-pro" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Gemini 2.5 pro&lt;/A&gt; would only cost a bit more than $20, the still experimental Gemini 3.0 pro about $33, Anthropic's smaller Claude 4.5 Haiku less than $17, the bigger Claude 4.5 Opus more than $80.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Personally, I'd probably go for one of the best available models because saving $10 for the conversion may lead to having a less optimal codebase for years to come. The current top models can be seen in e.g. the &lt;A href="https://lmarena.ai/de/leaderboard/webdev" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;LMArena leaderboard&lt;/A&gt;, so you can pick models with a good performance/price ratio.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From trying different AI agents and LLMs in the past, I also have to say that they all have different "personalities" and approaches with regards to communicating and reading/changing files. One model may do all changes in a file in one go, another model I have seen doing a dozen single-line changes one-by-one, with a full (costly!) LLM round trip for each modification. Sometimes models are more paranoid, inspecting files again and again, looking around to make sure they are not missing anything. This means that an isolated look at the token prices does not give the complete picture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-194536696"&gt;Key Learnings and Best Practices&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;All in all, here’s how to get the most out of the UI5 MCP server’s TypeScript conversion feature:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-127105910"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Before You Start&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create project documentation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;- Have an AI agent generate an AGENTS.md&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;file summarizing your app’s architecture (or write it yourself). This gives valuable context for the conversion and all future work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Choose the best model&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;- Don’t save $20-30 on a cheaper model when the result affects your codebase for years. Claude 4.5 Sonnet has worked well, Gemini 3.0 might even have a better performance/price ratio.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Commit everything&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;- Ensure you can easily revert or compare changes if needed. Also commit before you do additional manual changes or the agent starts its next phase, so you can revert or re-check in isolation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--144638964"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;During Conversion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Trust the process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;- Let the agent follow the MCP tool’s suggested order: project setup → central modules → custom controls → controllers. But:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Don’t hesitate to restart&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;- If the agent makes systematic mistakes (wrong tsconfig, excessive "any" casts), abort and restart cleanly with additional hints in your prompt if needed.&amp;nbsp; It’s faster than correcting a bad track when all the code has been touched. Or interrupt and adjust the guidance when you see a trend of minor issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Watch for context limits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;- When the agent signals a full context window (or when you feel/know/see it is), start fresh with: original prompt + note that conversion is in progress + current status summary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--341152469"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;After Initial Conversion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Expect remaining errors&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;- Budget some hours for manual polishing. This is normal and valuable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fix errors properly:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Type errors sometimes reveal actual bugs—fix them, don’t suppress them. Or report to the &lt;A href="https://github.com/UI5/openui5/issues" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;UI5 team&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;when the types are wrong.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create central type definitions instead of scattering them across files. The tool tells the agent to do so, but probably you have the better oversight and can clean this part up.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use specific UI5 event types &lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;(&lt;CODE&gt;Route$PatternMatchedEvent&lt;/CODE&gt;)&lt;/FONT&gt; not generic&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;Event&lt;/CODE&gt;. The tool tells the agent to do so, but the LLM often doesn't know all those types, so you are likely to see some of these issues remaining.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Excessive "any" casts defeat the purpose—replace with proper types.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--537665974"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Do not expect a perfect result!&lt;/STRONG&gt; This tool (or rather the AI coding agent instructed by this tool) doesn’t produce perfect TypeScript, but it gives you a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;massive head start&lt;/STRONG&gt;. A several-day manual conversion becomes an hour of agent work plus some hours of polishing with the benefits adding up afterwards day by day. That’s a big productivity gain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The equation has changed: even legacy apps in maintenance mode can now benefit from TypeScript conversion. The barrier that once made me postpone converting my own 8-year-old app has been lowered dramatically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What the tool does:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Removes the tedious part of the work so you can focus on fixing meaningful type errors, creating proper domain types, and improving code quality where it matters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What you still need:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;TypeScript knowledge and careful code review. The agent handles the tedious conversion; you handle the intelligent refinement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have a JavaScript UI5 app that could benefit from TypeScript, there’s never been a better time to make the switch.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Try it yourself:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The UI5 MCP server can be used with all AI coding assistants supporting MCP, is available&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/mcp-server" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;via npm&lt;/A&gt;, and installation instructions and its code are&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://github.com/UI5/mcp-server" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;at GitHub&lt;/A&gt;.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1767298281"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Challenge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most famous mathematical puzzles – it's more than a hundred years old – can be solved using SAP S/4HANA for advanced variant configuration (AVC).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We're discussing the "SEND + MORE = MONEY" puzzle, which falls under the category of verbal arithmetic, also known as alphametics, cryptarithms, or word addition (see Wikipedia for details).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="send_more_money.png" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351987iFADCF361E9D5158B/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="send_more_money.png" alt="send_more_money.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The invention of this brainteaser is attributed to the English author and mathematician Henry Dudeney, who published it in "The Strand Magazine" in July 1924. Rumor has it that a student once used this calculation in a letter to his father to request financial support.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What you see here is a plain-vanilla addition, with the slight difference that the figures are letters. Different letters represent different figures in the way that two different letters never stand for the same digit. Leading zeros are not allowed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But how can AVC help us in this regard? We'll use a configuration model with a constraint, and we'll try to figure out which restrictions are necessary to solve the problem with minimal effort. To this end, we'll conduct three experiments with different RESTRICTION parts in the constraint.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But first, let's see what we can find out with a bit of mental work:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As already stated, all letters mean different digits.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The carryover can never be greater than 1 because you need at least a sum of three one-digit numbers to get a carryover of 2. Let's assume that we add two digits and one carryover of 1: The maximum possible result is 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, resulting in a carryover of 1. The maximum in our situation is only 9 + 8 + 1 = 18, of course, as two different letters must have different number values.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Having said that, we can conclude that M = 1. Since M is itself a carryover and leading zeros are not allowed, other values do not apply.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Let's assume we have a carryover of 1 to add to S and M, then S + M&amp;nbsp; + 1 = S + 2 = 10 x M + O = 10 + O, equivalent to S – 8 = O. With a carryover of zero, we get S - 9 = O. As a result, S can only be 8 or 9.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Now, you can easily see that O must be zero: It can't be 1 because this would result in M = O = 1. Contradiction. Additionally, O can't be 2 or greater than 2, as the sum of S, M, and 1 can't be greater than 11. Of course, we also know now that S must be 9 and can't be 8.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Altogether, we get four different sets of restrictions :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-upper-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The addition itself&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No two letters have the same value.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A carryover of zero or one is added to two digits added in each place of the place-value system, resulting in a number smaller than or equal to 9 (next carryover is zero), or greater than 9 &amp;nbsp;(which would come with a new carryover of 1). This gives us a maximum of four different equations per place.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The values M = 1, S = 9, and O = 0.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can solve this puzzle with further logical considerations and by checking the remaining combinations. But let's see how much AVC can determine using only parts of these restrictions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570784776"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Solution Using an AVC Configuration Model&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before conducting the three experiments, we need to build a model.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These are the preliminary steps to make this puzzle available in the simulation environment:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a Class, for example, CL_SEND_MORE_MONEY, to contain the characteristics needed. The class type must be 300.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create characteristics for the class. You can use the letters S, E, N, D, M, O, R, and Y, plus the characteristics SEND, MORE, and MONEY. If one of the letters is already in use as a characteristic in your system, try alternatives like "S_". You can start creating a letter, for example, S, as a numeric characteristic with one character. Enter the digits from 0 to 9 as values. Then create E as a template using S. SEND, MORE, and MONEY are numeric characteristics with 4 or 5 characters.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a simple configurable material (you may call it SEND_MORE_MONEY), using the class CL_SEND_MORE_MONEY for classification. Maintain a plant for the material.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the PMEVC (product modeling environment for variant configuration), enter the material, plant, and BOM application PP01 ("Production - General").&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a profile for the product, processing mode "Advanced Variant Configuration".&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a constraint net.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a constraint. We use 'X' as an object variable in the editor code:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;OBJECTS:

X IS_A (300)CL_SEND_MORE_MONEY.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;The music is now within the restriction of the constraint (for details on the restriction, refer to the documentation &lt;A title="RESTRICTION: What the Constraint Does" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/f369b2eff700401494ba6e7c9a573288/1f722621df6143c6b6277fdcf0085d69.html?version=LATEST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;). Technically, we've got only one restriction, but we can combine several 'sub-restrictions' using the keyword AND, or a comma.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1374271271"&gt;First Experiment&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our first experiment, we want to do without restriction C because this is the most cumbersome to write down. Using the others, our RESTRICTION part could look like this:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RESTRICTION:

* No. 1: The summation itself

(X.SEND = X.S*1000 + X.E*100 + X.N*10 + X.D)
AND
(X.MORE = X.M*1000 + X.O*100 + X.R*10 + X.E)
AND
(X.MONEY = X.M*10000 + X.O*1000 + X.N*100 + X.E*10 + X.Y)
AND
(X.SEND + X.MORE = X.MONEY),

* No. 2: All values must be unique.

(NOT (X.S = X.E) AND NOT (X.S = X.N) AND NOT (X.S = X.D) AND NOT (X.S =
X.M) AND NOT (X.S = X.O) AND NOT (X.S = X.R) AND NOT (X.S = X.Y))
AND
(NOT (X.E = X.N) AND NOT (X.E = X.D) AND NOT (X.E = X.M) AND NOT (X.E =
X.O) AND NOT (X.E = X.R) AND NOT (X.E = X.Y))
AND
(NOT (X.N = X.D) AND NOT (X.N = X.M) AND NOT (X.N = X.O) AND NOT (X.N =
X.R) AND NOT (X.N = X.Y))
AND
(NOT (X.D = X.M) AND NOT (X.D = X.O) AND NOT (X.D = X.R) AND NOT (X.D =
X.Y))
AND
(NOT (X.M = X.O) AND NOT (X.M = X.R) AND NOT (X.M = X.Y))
AND
(NOT (X.O = X.R) AND NOT (X.O = X.Y))
AND NOT (X.R = X.Y),

* No. 3: The value restrictions found by reasoning

(X.M = 1)
AND
(X.O = 0)
AND
(X.S = 9).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second restriction may appear somewhat complicated at first glance. But note that we can't use syntax elements like FOR loops in the editor coding.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To ease our work with this second (sub-)restriction, we can use an LLM (large language model) and enter the following prompt:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left lia-indent-padding-left-120px" style="text-align : left; padding-left : 120px;"&gt;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;# List:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left lia-indent-padding-left-120px" style="text-align : left; padding-left : 120px;"&gt;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;X.S, X.E, X.N, X.D, X.M, X.O, X.R, X.Y&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left lia-indent-padding-left-120px" style="text-align : left; padding-left : 120px;"&gt;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;---&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-120px" style="padding-left : 120px;"&gt;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;Build a list of all pairs from this list, disregarding the order of the elements. Mathematically, the number of these pairs is "8 choose 2". Connect all pairs using this syntax: NOT (X.S = X.E) AND NOT (X.S = X.N) AND NOT... This means you should create an uninterrupted string of all possible inequalities connected by the keyword "AND".&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the model is ready and in status "Released", let's push the Test button and see what happens in the simulation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="push_the_button.png" style="width: 847px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352049i66D0C5CD5746CE64/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="push_the_button.png" alt="push_the_button.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When we try different values for E, all values but 5 will result in an inconsistency:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="eight_makes_inconsistent.png" style="width: 854px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352051iBC9177E308FFA9A6/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="eight_makes_inconsistent.png" alt="eight_makes_inconsistent.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="status_inconsistent.png" style="width: 158px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352052i9311D0BF1B06E49D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="status_inconsistent.png" alt="status_inconsistent.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;With E = 5, we get:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="exp_1_e_eq_5.png" style="width: 858px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352057i77C919028486F8BC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="exp_1_e_eq_5.png" alt="exp_1_e_eq_5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="status_released.png" style="width: 161px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352058i8E50762E46938919/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="status_released.png" alt="status_released.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This leaves us with three possible values for R: 3, 4, and 8 (keeping in mind the uniqueness restriction B). But we can tell from the value MORE = 1085 (the value is greyed out, leaving no alternative!) that only 8 works fine, so we've solved our puzzle:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="9567_1085_10652.png" style="width: 302px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352061iB671FCA6C92C20AA/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="9567_1085_10652.png" alt="9567_1085_10652.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Note that, if you enter E = 5 right away or after reloading the configuration model, also the value for R = 8 is greyed out immediately.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's try a different approach!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1177757766"&gt;Second Experiment&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our second experiment, we drop D (values for M, S, and O) and use the following RESTRICTION (with No. 1 to 3 corresponding to A, B, and C from above):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RESTRICTION:

* No. 1: The summation itself

(X.SEND = X.S*1000 + X.E*100 + X.N*10 + X.D)

AND

AND
(X.SEND + X.MORE = X.MONEY),

(X.M = 1).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This appears to be very similar to our first experiment, except that the values for S and O are missing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The only work to do with this example is to write down No. 1 (a no-brainer), have No. 2 generated by AI, and think a bit to get X.M = 1 (no leading zeros!). After this, you see that the values for S, M, and O have been fixed in the simulation, and you just need to figure out what E has to be.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Last_exp_wo_values.png" style="width: 912px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352091i29A4B643DF2E59B7/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Last_exp_wo_values.png" alt="Last_exp_wo_values.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The effort is just the same as with the first experiment: AVC takes over the brainwork to get the values of S and O.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;And we already know that E = 5 does the trick:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="5_does_the_trick.png" style="width: 913px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352094iE471900969E054E7/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5_does_the_trick.png" alt="5_does_the_trick.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;That's it!

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Update after SAP Development Support Feedback&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We received confirmation from SAP Development Support that the behaviour we are seeing is standard SAP behaviour (“by design”), not a system defect.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP explained that forecast consumption is driven strictly by the data sent by the customer. If earlier forecast periods are no longer transmitted and the cumulative received quantity is not updated accordingly, SAP assumes that in-transit quantities cover the upcoming demand and therefore suppresses forecast requirements in MD04.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP recommended two standard approaches:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customers should accurately report the cumulative quantity received, and&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customers should continue sending all open forecast periods until goods are confirmed as received.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our case, the received quantity reporting is largely accurate. The main issue remains that some customers stop sending forecast periods once orders are placed, which causes SAP to consume future forecast buckets and distort the demand view in MD04.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP also confirmed that there is no standard switch to selectively suppress forecast consumption. Any technical adjustment would be a custom solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Question to the Community&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Has anyone faced a similar issue with forecast consumption in scheduling agreements? How did you address it — process alignment with customers, or a technical enhancement? Any shared experience or best practice would be very helpful.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thanks for the detailed explanation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We face the problem, that the BO_TRQ_ROOT_ALL is empty (there is no data when clicking on this node) therefore we cannot proceed. Do you have an idea why?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;thanks&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Experts,&lt;BR /&gt;i have the following issue. During the migration of customers, the information for the tax classification was filled incorrectly into the migration template and migrated with the migration cockpit&lt;BR /&gt;All entries consist of a country code, the tax category (mainly TTX1) and the tax classification (1 or 0).&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Because of an human error, many entries have a variety of country codes, when they all should only have one specific country code.&lt;BR /&gt;As a result none of these entries are displayed in the app "manage business partner master data" under the sales area section.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If i manually edit those business partners, i can add an entry with the correct country code, that&amp;nbsp;overwrites the wrong entry that is not visible.&lt;BR /&gt;So far i have looked into the mass maintenance tool, but there i can only change the tax classification to a different value, but not the country code, which is the incorrect entry.&lt;BR /&gt;I also looked into the app "mass import of business partner master data", but there i get a message that the fields i want to import (correct) are alread filled.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The table that contains this data is called "KNVI".&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;My question is, is there way to do this correction in mass ? Can i update these entries with the migration cockpit or did i miss another option ?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Best regards&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Lukas&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Use `api-key` as header property within the API-Key you do obtain via Watch-Tower / Control-Tower Environment section. It's only working within this header property attached to the request (not the token-request). Hope this helps &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;You are correct that 309 is not suitable for your case. The 201 + 501 workaround is valid, but the real efficiency gain will come from batch derivation setup or production order postings once PP is ready. That way, you’ll minimize manual batch classification and capture losses more transparently.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;So the recommended approach would be&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Short-term (before PP is live)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Continue with 201 + 501 workaround, but explore batch derivation configuration to reduce manual batch classification effort.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Medium-term (once PP is partially configured)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Start using production orders with 261/101 postings, which naturally handle batch creation and process losses.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Long-term (full PP implementation)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Move entirely to order-based postings, scrap management, and automated batch derivation for stage-wise SFG tracking.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Francesco,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;thanks for the provided urls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've already setup Eclipse for the public cloud system.&lt;BR /&gt;Unfortunately the links you provided don't explain how you could maintain documentations for data elements. The youtube video shows how to open a data element with SAP GUI in SE11. But this is the problem I have: I am not able to do that on a public cloud system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;So the issue is still the same as stated in the initial question: Am I right, that currently there is no option to maintain the documentation of a data element on S4HC?&lt;BR /&gt;If there is not, it would be great if you could think about this for a the future roadmap. With this it would be possible to integrate custom build applications seamlessly in a sense of provided help documentation.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thank you&lt;BR /&gt;Daniel&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;Cierro el último newsletter del año con una mirada clara: CIOs acelerando con foco, CFOs pidiendo impacto medible, arquitectos cuidando el core y consultores redefiniendo su rol. En estas líneas repaso cómo SAP BTP, Joule y Business Data Cloud dejaron de ser promesa en 2025 y empiezan a sentar las bases de cómo vamos a trabajar, decidir e innovar en 2026.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember201" id="toc-hId-1896384694"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":keycap_1:"&gt;1️⃣&lt;/span&gt; Joule for Developers: IA para acelerar la adopción sin perder control del código&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP potencia a los desarrolladores con Joule for Developers, integrado en el ciclo de desarrollo para acelerar tareas repetitivas. La IA ayuda a generar y adaptar código dentro del contexto de SAP BTP sin perder estándares de calidad. Esto no reemplaza la lógica de diseño, pero reduce el tiempo en tareas técnicas básicas. Impulsa la adopción de IA en entornos empresariales con prácticas seguras. El foco es mantener clean core mientras se amplía la productividad.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Según SAP, esta capacidad está pensada para que los developers no solo codifiquen más rápido, sino con mayor confianza y alineados al estándar de la empresa. La ventaja principal es eliminar fricción en actividades tediosas y permitir que el equipo se concentre en lógica de negocio. El desafío es integrar estas asistencias en pipelines existentes sin perder gobernanza.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://news.sap.com/latinamerica/2025/11/sap-empodera-a-los-desarrolladores-para-acelerar-la-adopcion-de-la-ia-en-el-mundo-empresarial/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://news.sap.com/latinamerica/2025/11/sap-empodera-a-los-desarrolladores-para-acelerar-la-adopcion-de-la-ia-en-el-mundo-empresarial/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember205" id="toc-hId-1699871189"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":keycap_2:"&gt;2️⃣&lt;/span&gt; Joule for Consultants: acelerando entregas y calidad de proyectos SAP&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP Joule for Consultants ya está disponible y diseñado para asistir a consultores en transformaciones SAP a gran escala con guía inteligente y contexto experto.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;·&amp;nbsp;Reduce tiempo de búsqueda de documentación, interpretación de código y adopción de mejores prácticas, apoyado en una base de conocimiento profundamente curada por SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;·&amp;nbsp;Puede acelerar la ejecución de proyectos hasta ~14 % y disminuir iteraciones de diseño y retrabajo.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;La integración con herramientas como Microsoft 365 Copilot ofrece un flujo fluido entre contextos.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Esto permite que los consultores se concentren más en decisiones de negocio que en tareas repetitivas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Un caso concreto viene de grandes firmas de consultoría que están adoptando Joule for Consultants para mejorar tiempos de entrega y calidad del servicio a clientes: por ejemplo, Deloitte anunció que la solución les permite acceder rápidamente a prácticas líderes y contenido SAP exclusivo, liberando tiempo para actividades de mayor impacto estratégico en SAP Engage y proyectos de transformación integral.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Más allá de métricas de tiempo ahorrado, el impacto real se ve en mejor alineación entre diseño técnico y necesidades del cliente, reduciendo rework y elevando la confianza en decisiones durante el ciclo del proyecto. El reto para muchas organizaciones será definir métricas claras de impacto (KPIs) que puedan medir estos beneficios en cada entrega.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/latinamerica/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant/sap-consulting-capability.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.sap.com/latinamerica/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant/sap-consulting-capability.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":keycap_3:"&gt;3️⃣&lt;/span&gt; Joule Studio: agentes de IA que ejecutan procesos, no solo tareas&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Joule Studio permite crear agentes de IA en SAP Build. Los agentes ejecutan workflows con contexto de negocio. No es solo RPA, es automatización inteligente. Se reduce código y tiempo de diseño. La gobernanza se vuelve crítica.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Imaginar un agente que gestione excepciones de facturación o approvals complejos ya no es ciencia ficción. El desafío real es definir límites, auditoría y “human-in-the-loop”. La ventaja es eficiencia; el riesgo, cajas negras operativas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/joule-studio.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/joule-studio.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":keycap_4:"&gt;4️⃣&lt;/span&gt; Nuevos skills SAP: del funcional técnico al “AI-enabled consultant”&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;La llegada de Joule cambia los perfiles SAP. Menos foco en ejecución manual. Más foco en diseño, validación y gobierno. Los skills técnicos se combinan con negocio. La capacitación se vuelve estratégica.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Saber configurar ya no alcanza. Entender procesos, datos e IA será diferencial. SAP impulsa nuevas certificaciones, pero el reto está en reconvertir talento existente. Ventaja: perfiles más completos. Riesgo: brecha de skills si no se actúa a tiempo.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://training.sap.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://training.sap.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":keycap_5:"&gt;5️⃣&lt;/span&gt; SAP BDC Connect + Microsoft Fabric: datos SAP donde el negocio ya trabaja&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP anunció Business Data Cloud Connect para Microsoft Fabric, extendiendo la integración de BDC con la plataforma de datos de Microsoft. Esto habilita acceso bi-direccional sin copia de datos entre BDC y Microsoft Fabric OneLake, preservando contexto semántico. Los equipos pueden usar SAP data products directamente en Fabric para analytics, AI y BI. Potencia herramientas como Power BI, Copilot Studio y agentes de IA dentro del ecosistema Microsoft. El enfoque acelera insights y reduce la fricción de replicar datos.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;En la práctica, esto significa que los datos SAP ya gobernados en BDC pueden ser usados en vivo en herramientas cotidianas del negocio (Power BI, Excel, Teams) sin mover o duplicar la información. La ventaja es una sola fuente de verdad que impulsa tanto AI generativa como analítica avanzada. El reto principal está en coordinar roles y seguridad entre plataformas diferentes, especialmente en organizaciones grandes donde existen múltiples silos y políticas de acceso.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://news.sap.com/2025/11/sap-bdc-connect-for-microsoft-fabric-business-insights-ai-innovation/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://news.sap.com/2025/11/sap-bdc-connect-for-microsoft-fabric-business-insights-ai-innovation/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember226" id="toc-hId-1503357684"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":keycap_6:"&gt;6️⃣&lt;/span&gt; IA + Datos nativos: SAP HANA Cloud, agentic memory y cero-copias con Snowflake&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP HANA Cloud se consolida como la base de datos &lt;EM&gt;AI-native&lt;/EM&gt; con Model Context Protocol (MCP) disponible en GA, permitiendo a agentes IA navegar relaciones complejas de datos. Los knowledge graphs automáticos agilizan la generación de modelos semánticos del negocio sin semanas de esfuerzo manual (Q1 2026). La incorporación de agentic memory permite a agentes de IA aprender de interacciones pasadas para decisiones más inteligentes. SAP BDC se integra con Snowflake como extensión para habilitar datos semánticamente ricos con zero-copy, preservando contexto y gobernanza. Esto impulsa una visión donde datos empresariales e IA coexisten con escalabilidad y menor duplicación.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Hacia fines de 2025 SAP reporta cientos de casos de uso de Business AI con impacto medible en valor de negocio. MCP en HANA Cloud permite que agentes IA entiendan estructuras más allá de filas y columnas, abarcando relaciones complejas y búsquedas semánticas. La generación automática de knowledge graphs y la memoria &lt;EM&gt;agentic&lt;/EM&gt; reducen tiempo de preparación y elevan la inteligencia contextual de los agentes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Por otro lado, la integración de SAP BDC con Snowflake habilita &lt;EM&gt;zero-copy data sharing&lt;/EM&gt;, reduciendo silos y costos de replicación sin perder gobernanza. Esto abre modelos híbridos donde SAP conserva el contexto semántico y Snowflake aporta escala e innovación para analítica y AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://news.sap.com/2025/11/business-ai-innovation-unveiled-at-sap-teched/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://news.sap.com/2025/11/business-ai-innovation-unveiled-at-sap-teched/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember231" id="toc-hId-1306844179"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":keycap_7:"&gt;7️⃣&lt;/span&gt; Reflexión de fin de año: de experimentar con IA a rediseñar la empresa para 2026&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;2025 fue el año donde SAP dejó claro que la IA empresarial ya es real. Joule pasó de asistente a agente, y los datos dejaron de ser solo reporting. BTP, BDC y HANA Cloud se alinearon en una visión coherente. La conversación cambió de “qué probar” a “qué escalar”. El foco ahora está en impacto, no en hype.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Mirando todo lo anunciado este año, Joule en sus distintas formas, Business Data Cloud conectando ecosistemas como Microsoft Fabric y Snowflake, HANA Cloud volviéndose &lt;EM&gt;AI-native&lt;/EM&gt;, creo que 2026 no va a tratar de sumar más tecnología, sino de tomar decisiones más valientes. Las organizaciones que lleguen a 2026 con datos gobernados, skills preparados y una visión clara de dónde usar IA tendrán una ventaja enorme. Las que sigan en pilotos aislados van a sentir que “llegaron tarde”, aunque la tecnología esté ahí. SAP puso las piezas sobre la mesa; ahora el desafío es cultural, organizacional y estratégico.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

In the General tab, you'll find a slider button called “Analytical Support”. Choosing this button, an&amp;nbsp;addition&amp;nbsp;field is displayed called “Master Data View”.&amp;nbsp;Here, you can enter the&amp;nbsp;master data view which is used for this field in analytical apps (like&amp;nbsp;the “Journal Entry Analyzer” app). In our case, it's prefilled with&amp;nbsp;“I_WorkforcePerson”, which is the same CDS view we had already chosen as&amp;nbsp;value&amp;nbsp;help view&amp;nbsp;(see screenshot below).&amp;nbsp;Note that there is also a dedicated value help view called “I_WorkforcePersonVH”,&amp;nbsp;which&amp;nbsp;would be&amp;nbsp;even more suitable for use as “Value Help View”.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="georg_wilhelm_3-1764960838797.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349081iD579B67C8A3DE984/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="georg_wilhelm_3-1764960838797.png" alt="georg_wilhelm_3-1764960838797.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Employee Reference” custom field:&amp;nbsp;activating Analytical Support and choosing Master Data View&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Prefilling the “Master Data View”&amp;nbsp;is the default&amp;nbsp;behavior&amp;nbsp;of the Custom Fields app&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;cases where&amp;nbsp;the value&amp;nbsp;help&amp;nbsp;view fulfills all the requirements of an analytical master data view. The view must&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;header&amp;nbsp;annotation&amp;nbsp;“@Analytics.dataCategory: #DIMENSION”. Please note that&amp;nbsp;within the value help&amp;nbsp;for the “Master Data View”, only CDS views that fulfill&amp;nbsp;this criterion are shown.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Go ahead and save and publish the custom field again.&amp;nbsp;Next, reload the “Journal Entry Analyzer” app. Click on the column header of the “Employee Reference” custom&amp;nbsp;field to see that all of the four&amp;nbsp;text display&amp;nbsp;options are displayed.&amp;nbsp;These&amp;nbsp;allow you to configure whether and how the description should be displayed (see screenshot

Reference”:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before selecting a master data view, the CDS extension&amp;nbsp;that had been generated for the custom field "Employee Reference" for&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;cube view "I_GLACCOUNTLINEITEMCUBE" underneath&amp;nbsp;the query&amp;nbsp;view&amp;nbsp; "C_GLLINEITEMSQ0001" looked

    <content>I am not sure what this could be based on the screenshots. I would go back to the xml and see if you have a tag that indicates what the basis of the lump sum would be. Like this: &amp;lt;lumpsum-calc basedOn="CurrentSalary"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/lumpsum-calc&amp;gt; This will indicate the denominator of the lump sum. In addition, the percentage will always be zero until an amount is entered. If you want a default value in the sheet when you open it, it will have to be defined in the guidelines.</content>

    <content>I agree with Xavier. in addition, there is no way for us to help you if you say you have a question regarding a formula and then do not include the formula or any screenshots. You need to help us help you.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I was mistaken to discard the LINK formula too quickly. It was the way to go, but I wasn't aware that I also have to link the dimensions that I don't want to perform the join on, which is very different to SQL.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>thanks. i checked one of the threads and the solution was to add "else" condition that was missing. in my case there is no "if", just simple lookup formula that takes values from custom calculated field from the form (the calculated field is based on concatenation of Managerial Level and pmRating) and then I have a lookup table with all the variations of Level+Rating and what I want to show in the custom lookup field.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I agree with you and I believe that, unless we exchange knowledge in some way, AI cannot help to make it quickly available.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is much knowledge in people's minds that cannot be discovered until we grab a coffee, take a break, or be together in a Community conference. Sometimes, whether close to us or not, we have someone with questions, concerns, or challenges, and we have experienced that challenge before. Together, a better solution can arise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is always a bit more difficult when the relations are 100% virtual....&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

                     ; $backofficeSearchCfgId  ; 86a8220b-3fc0-400e-8798-3afe09dcc973 ; facet_catalog        ; MULTISELECT    ; 100     ; false                  ; 2                     ;

                    if (!searchProvider.isValidFacetType(indexType, facetType)) {// 84
                        throw new InterceptorException("Facet type cannot be used for facets: " + String.valueOf(facetType));// 86
                    } else {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here `searchProvider` is configurable but&amp;nbsp; by default it's Solr.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;But now the most interesting part: check the code of `&lt;SPAN&gt;SolrAsSearchProvider::isValidFacetType()` from the `adaptivesearchsolr` extension:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    public List&amp;lt;AsFacetType&amp;gt; getSupportedFacetTypes(final String indexType) {
        return SUPPORTED_FACET_TYPES;// 314
    }

    public boolean isValidFacetType(final String indexType, final AsFacetType facetType) {
        return this.getSupportedFacetTypes(indexType).contains(facetType);// 320
    }
 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So solr just checks the facet type against a static list, which is initialized&amp;nbsp; as:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;    static {
        SUPPORTED_FACET_TYPES = List.of(AsFacetType.REFINE, AsFacetType.MULTISELECT_OR, AsFacetType.MULTISELECT_AND);// 101
    }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So...&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Solr supports MULTISELECT_OR and MULTISELECT_AND but doesn't support MULTISELECT which we're trying to import in backofficesearch.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;And because of that the impex from the backofficesearch fails when I do platform update.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Am I misconfiguring something here or are these extensions incompatible?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Yes, this behavior is expected in SAP Analytics Cloud.The SUBTOTAL function has a hard limit of 10 dimensions, and there is no alternative function that removes this limit. SUBTOTAL also works only on base measures, not on aggregated or calculated measures created in the model. When used on aggregated measures, it fails by design due to calculation order restrictions. The recommended workaround is to reduce dimensions, or calculate percent of total in the source query or model instead of using SUBTOTAL.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;No, it is not possible to apply custom colors to Heatmap rows using CSS or any other styling method in SAP Analytics Cloud.SAC does not support CSS access or custom styling at the widget or row level. The Totals row color in a Heatmap cannot be changed independently from the default theme. Conditional formatting also does not apply to Totals rows in Heatmaps.&lt;BR /&gt;A practical workaround is to place totals in a separate table or numeric point and style that widget instead.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Thank you, Bill, for the quick response. If I understand correctly, for each new feature we need to create a new Z extension project and include it in the base project’s .cim list. With this approach, the number of extension projects will continue to grow as new features are released. This also means we must ensure that: Extension project names are maintained in alphabetical order in the .cim file. The Overview.page is copied from the previous extension project into the new extension project so that it always contains the latest modified version of the code. Additionally, all SAP BAS projects and extension projects would be maintained within a single Git repository, initialized at the projects/ folder level. Could you please confirm if this is the recommended best practice, or point me to the appropriate documentation or SAP Learning course that describes the correct and supported approach?</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why SAP BTP matters for teaching&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;SAP BTP remains the cornerstone of SAP’s strategy: it enables the clean‑core principle while demonstrating side‑by‑side extension patterns that safely extend SAP core systems. For academic programs preparing students for industry practice, BTP offers an integrated, modern platform for application extension, integration, data management, analytics and AI — all in a cloud environment that maps directly to real‑world patterns.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s in the App Development and Coding portfolio&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Below are the principal curricula and academic experiences available now for classrooms teaching and labs. Each entry includes a placeholder for the curriculum one‑pager so you can link to full instructor materials and logistics when ready.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;U&gt;SAP Build Process Automation &lt;/U&gt;— Teaches how to identify, design and implement workflow automation using Build Process Automation to reduce repetitive tasks and streamline processes.&lt;BR /&gt;(One‑pager: &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/QcqHqJG?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1235761" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;link)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Low/No‑Code Development with SAP Build Apps &lt;/U&gt;— Teaches the concepts and practice of low/no‑code app composition, connecting apps to SAP S/4HANA, and designing user experiences.&lt;BR /&gt;(One‑pager: &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/1JuYD5P?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1247573" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;link)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Pro‑Code Development with SAP Build Code&lt;/U&gt; — Equips learners with modern pro‑code practices, including SAP Joule‑assisted code generation and development workflows for scalable applications.&lt;BR /&gt;(One‑pager: &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/GbCLev8?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1260720" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;link)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Pro‑Code Application Development with SAP BTP (ABAP Environment &amp;amp; BAS)&lt;/U&gt; — Covers RAP and CAP models, RESTful application programming, and Cloud Foundry deployment to support clean‑core and side‑by‑side extension patterns.&lt;BR /&gt;(One‑pager: &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/WwxB4UV?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1235759" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;link)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;SAP Integration Suite&lt;/U&gt; &amp;nbsp;— Hands‑on curriculum for application and data integration across cloud and on‑premise systems, using standard integration patterns and monitoring practices.&lt;BR /&gt;(One‑pager: &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/w86z7XL?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1235760" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;link)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;U&gt;Document AI Tutorials &amp;amp; Global Bike extension (coming soon)&lt;/U&gt; &lt;EM&gt;— Practical tutorials on Document AI, including an extension scenario for the Global Bike sample system to demonstrate document processing in real use cases.&lt;BR /&gt;(Tutorials: &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-university-alliances-global-blog-posts/leveraging-sap-document-ai-to-bring-intelligent-document-processing-into-a/ba-p/14231967" target="_self"&gt;link)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No-barrier assets for faculty: Academic Lessons&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A central asset across the portfolio is the set of Academic Lessons designed to be well aligned with a typical course syllabus structure. We encourage faculty to build course syllabus around Learning Journeys and to leverage SAP cloud practice system access available through &lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/lecturers" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Learning Hub, student edition (LHSE)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This approach gives students step&lt;/SPAN&gt;‑&lt;SPAN&gt;by&lt;/SPAN&gt;‑&lt;SPAN&gt;step learning alongside hands&lt;/SPAN&gt;‑&lt;SPAN&gt;on practice in real SAP cloud systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Relevant Academic Lessons already prepared to include in a teaching pathway:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI and GenAI Fundamentals (&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-university-alliances-global-academic-content/coming-soon-artificial-intelligence-and-generative-ai-fundamentals/ta-p/14248664" target="_self"&gt;Academic Lesson)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Introduction to AI and SAP Business AI (&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-university-alliances-global-academic-content/new-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-and-sap-business-ai/ta-p/14091393" target="_self"&gt;Academic Lesson)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Low/No‑Code Composition and Automation with SAP Build Apps (&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-university-alliances-global-academic-content/low-code-no-code-composition-and-automation-with-sap-build/ta-p/14068845" target="_self"&gt;Academic Lesson)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These lessons map naturally into a Learning Journey that progresses from foundational concepts (AI fundamentals, low‑code design) to applied practice (Build Apps, Integration Suite, Document AI), with optional pro‑code extensions (Build Code, ABAP/BAS). Using LHSE cloud practice access, students can complete Discovery Center missions, follow guided tutorials, and earn records of achievement and have 2 attempts of professional certifications per year.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hands‑on, flexible academic editions and support&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The portfolio supports a range of academic needs: free sandboxes and trials for many BTP services, low‑cost exclusive teaching environments (typical UCC offers such as 600€ / 1.100€ per half/full year), Discovery Center missions, and Train‑the‑Trainer sessions upon request. University Competence Centers (UCCs) and Academic Competence Centers (ACCs) deliver regional classroom packages and guided exercises. Faculty at SAP University Alliances member institutions can contact their local UCC/ACC or &lt;A href="mailto:universityalliances@sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;universityalliances@sap.com to get started&lt;/A&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="mailto:universityalliances@sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Looking ahead and community engagement&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In this series we will report updates, announce new Discovery Center missions available for academic use, sandboxes and pilots (including further content developments in GenAI, Agentic and Business AI), and showcase classroom case studies. We welcome your feedback and classroom experiences to help refine these materials, broaden and scale our academic portfolio.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi All,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am facing the issue with the story report which I am building for my client.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;They want to include a lot of data, i.e. personal information, biographical information, job information and data gathered during the additional data collection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I managed to build the query which includes all of the data tables which are needed to meet the business requirement. But I am facing the following issue: not all data which is there in the onboarding dashboard, is in the report. I was modyfying the query multiple times but there is always something missing. I managed to determine that there are following issues:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- the query which contains the biographical information and linked tables (country-specific Information, dependents, email information, phone information).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- the report has the filter for legal entity used for the country which data should be visible in the report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Removing the above from makes all the data which is missing appeared in the report. However it appears with empty rows, only the process ID is visivble, but all the rest (i.e. user ID) is empty. User ID should be there as the data collection steps are in most of the cases completed. Moreover, keeping them is needed to meet the business requirement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I raised the support ticket with SAP, but they replied that this is due to the query design and does not fall under the scope of the product support team. There seems to be no clear documentation on how to design the query to make it working correctly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any feedback will be much appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I attached the screen shot of the query for your reference.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you in advance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Piotr Retecki&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thank you for the response &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/348"&gt;@Lakshmipathi&lt;/a&gt; . Could you explain the first option "Replace Existing Records" in the migration cockpit more ?&lt;BR /&gt;To my knowledge it is not possible, once you have migrated a data set, to update this imported data with a new import, but only with MDG tools.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Best regards&lt;BR /&gt;Lukas&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hello Kerisha, I have the same requirement for a UK public sector SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud customer. The customer has suppliers with multiple postal and email addresses, and for the same reasons you outlined below, we do not want to use partner functions. It has been almost six months since you raised the improvement request with SAP — could you please share SAP’s response or current status?</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Nice feature. Couple of comments&lt;BR /&gt;1. It seems that the underlying queries are still leveraging the nameclass ABAP implementation with the gap of hierarchies for custom fields. This gap of nameclass is not exposed to many customer as it was only used in GR in prior release. With this booklet, the gap is exposed to more customers in Accounting.&lt;BR /&gt;2. We do see nowdays ANI are abled to be posted to CU, PC and SEG. But it is not flexible to extend to all fields, especially custom fields.&lt;BR /&gt;3. With GRPL, it is easier to map from standard fields in ACDOCA to custom fields in ACDOCU, but why ACDOCU could not have those standard fields? and make the fields structure exactly same between ACDOCA and ACDOCU? We do see the business function for public sector has been enhanced to fill this gap, but why not for all fields?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;i started working with UI Theme Designer cause we need to setup different color setting for each system in S/4 landscape. However, after setting some basic stuff i run into issue, that when i want to e.g. setup colors in Calendar, i have no idea which parameters should be set. There is no indication in Designer itself and i ended up with trial &amp;amp; error, but this is time consuming, e.g. for Calendar:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="S0027140105_0-1765814311069.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352211i8F643219F2FFFBFF/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="S0027140105_0-1765814311069.png" alt="S0027140105_0-1765814311069.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I want to have more saturated text and in my custom color scheme, but i am at loss where to look for. Is there any interactive help in Designer or somewhere else when i need to change something particular? Also Search bar is visible only when i Save &amp;amp; Preview in another page, which is really time consuming so trial &amp;amp; error is really not possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;FYI: Theme Designer is updated and no issues indicated in report&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;WDG_MAINTAIN_UR_MIMES&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Many thanks.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Thomas,&lt;BR /&gt;thank you for clarification.&lt;BR /&gt;So I have only the derived parameters listed &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/advanced-financial-closing/user/parameter-maintenance" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; available in Fiori Apps, correct?&lt;BR /&gt;Because in theory I would expect that I could define new task list models and this way define additional parameters.&lt;BR /&gt;But the desciption I find &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/advanced-financial-closing/local-settings/how-to-define-parameter-types" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; only refers to ABAP programs (=jobs).&lt;BR /&gt;Or is there another way to add parameters to a task list?&lt;BR /&gt;Regards&lt;BR /&gt;Christian&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;DIV&gt;Dear community,&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;I am working in an SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud environment and analyzing the exchange rate difference postings generated during the procurement and payment process. I have encountered a posting logic that I do not fully understand from a functional and accounting perspective.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;I will describe the scenario in a simplified way:&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;• Purchase order for 1,000,000 in foreign currency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;• Goods Receipt posted with an exchange rate of 1.1566.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;• Subsequently, the Supplier Invoice is posted for the same amount (1,000,000), but with an exchange rate of 1.1727.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Due to the exchange rate difference between the Goods Receipt and the Invoice, the system posts an adjustment to price/variance accounts, impacting purchase or consumption accounts (for example 6011 / 6111). This behavior is clear to me.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Later on, the payment to the vendor is executed using an exchange rate of 1.1634.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;At payment time, the accounting document contains the following postings:&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;• Bank posting (as expected).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;• Clearing of the vendor account 4000 (as expected).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;• A negative exchange rate difference, posted to account 668 (exchange rate losses).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt; My question arises here:&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;In addition to the above, the system generates an additional accounting entry with the same amount, where:&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;• A debit is posted to account 6680 (negative exchange rate difference), and&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;• A corresponding credit is posted to account 7680 (positive exchange rate difference).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;In other words, an additional posting between 6680 and 7680 is created with no net impact on P&amp;amp;L. While the balances offset each other, I do not fully understand the functional purpose of this posting in the context of standard exchange rate difference handling.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Could someone please explain why SAP generates this additional “mirror” entry between negative and positive exchange rate difference accounts at payment time?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Is this related to the clearing or reversal of previously posted exchange rate differences, or is it part of the standard exchange rate difference logic in S/4HANA Public Cloud?&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Many thanks in advance for your support&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/18635"&gt;@ErikaT&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;most likely you have a mismatch between the format of fields: you can only aggregate amount with amount and money with money (and I would think percent with percent). Also make sure the lower level field is marked as reportable and calculate total (it cannot be editable either it needs to be read-only = yes I believe).&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>SAP Central Business Configuration Best Practices During SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Upgrades</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/STRONG&gt;, customers benefit from regular upgrades and updates that bring the latest innovations, enhanced security, and improved performance. With SAP Central Business Configuration serving as the single entry point for scoping, organizational structures, and configuration activities, it is natural that upgrade cycles involve certain considerations within SAP Central Business Configuration.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Protective Measures Matter During Upgrades&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Think of these measures as the safety rails on your system. By locking down critical operations (transports, data migrations, extensibility) during upgrade windows, SAP ensures the upgrade process can run smoothly without unintended side effects − protecting the system from half-done changes or version mismatches.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With SAP rolling out major &lt;STRONG&gt;upgrades&lt;/STRONG&gt; twice a year (typically in February and August) and regular &lt;STRONG&gt;updates&lt;/STRONG&gt; (hotfix collections) every two weeks between major upgrades, having a clear restriction schedule allows customers to adopt innovations in a controlled, manageable way. For more information on the schedule, please refer to: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A title="Upgrade &amp;amp; Maintenance Schedule for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, 3-System Landscape" href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/09/58ffa59e-f97d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Upgrade &amp;amp;

around upgrade time, as it’s typically time consuming. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Avoid &lt;STRONG&gt;large deployments&lt;/STRONG&gt;to prevent stuck deployments or partial content activation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Perform business &lt;STRONG&gt;configuration activities&lt;/STRONG&gt; until &lt;STRONG&gt;8 hours&lt;/STRONG&gt; before system downtime.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Make changes to your &lt;STRONG&gt;scope&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;organizational structure&lt;/STRONG&gt; up until the content upgrade begins. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For the parallel line, avoid initiating &lt;STRONG&gt;rebase&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;merge&lt;/STRONG&gt; before the upgrade starts, as these actions lock the workspace.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Avoid scheduling &lt;STRONG&gt;critical go-lives&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;User Acceptance Testing&lt;/STRONG&gt; (UAT) around upgrades.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For the 2-system landscape, in addition to the above, avoid releasing &lt;STRONG&gt;transport requests&lt;/STRONG&gt; from the quality system to the production system.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Central Business Configuration Impacts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let’s look at how the SAP Central Business Configuration system behaves during these system upgrades.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. &lt;STRONG&gt;During Update&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;SPAN&gt;Here’s the update maintenance schedule for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, 3-system landscape:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Update windows and time of workspace locking per region" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352218iF7A9B756A9B1AE48/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="FabianAckermann_0-1765817241166.png" alt="Update windows and time of workspace locking per region" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Update windows and time of workspace locking per region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please note that &lt;STRONG&gt;deployments&lt;/STRONG&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Preface&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Modern enterprises increasingly expect their integration platforms to do more than reliably move data between systems. SAP Integration Suite, combined with SAP BTP AI services, provides a foundation to embed intelligence directly into integration flows. This post highlights how combining integration with AI can unlock new capabilities and drive smarter, more adaptive processes across the enterprise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enterprise integrations traditionally rely on deterministic, structured data—a design paradigm that has supported SAP business processes for decades. This determinism is what allows ERP systems to automatically and reliably create documents, update statuses, or trigger follow-on actions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When a payload arrives in a predefined, standard format—via interfaces such as APIs, IDocs, or RFCs—the ERP system can create a business document and drive it forward to the furthest possible system-determined state, guided entirely by the incoming structured fields and the process logic configured within SAP ERP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, an incoming ORDERS05 IDoc carries fields such as BSART (document type), VKORG (sales organization), KUNNR (sold-to), MATNR, MENGE, and PSTYV (item category). Each of these fields is restricted to predefined, allowed values and mapped to controlled domains in SAP—document types, organizational structures, master data, and item categories. Because of this, the system can deterministically derive pricing, partner functions, credit checks, availability checks, and subsequent status movements without any human involvement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, many real-world processes reach a designed stopping point—not due to technical limitations, but because a critical decision input exists only as free-text narrative that requires interpretation. At this point, the system can no longer progress deterministically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One scenario where this consistently occurs is when free-text inputs determine the next business action. High-value examples include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;customer return comments in RMAs (Return Merchandise Authorization), capturing defect descriptions, expectations, or reason narratives;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;exception remarks on delivery notes, such as damage details, refusal reasons, or access issues; and&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;justification text in travel expense claims, explaining non-compliant or unusual charges.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These narrative fields often dictate the downstream outcome—whether a return is approved, a delivery is blocked, or an expense is reimbursed—but only after a human reads and interprets them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;GenAI as the Semantic Bridge&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recent advances in Generative AI — powered by large language models (LLMs) — make it possible to automate this traditionally human-only interpretation step. These models can read the free-form comments contained in incoming messages, infer intent and context, and return structured, process-ready attributes in a fast and consistent manner, which the integration layer can pass directly into ERP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To realize this, the integration flow could simply call the LLM and instruct it to convert narrative comments into ERP-compatible attributes, codes, or flags. The model applies reasoning to questions such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is the customer asking for a refund or a replacement?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is the delivery refusal due to damage or customer unavailability?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is the expense violation justified or not justified?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on this, the model produces clean ERP-friendly outputs, for example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ReturnActionCode = "REFUND" or "REPLACEMENT"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;DeliveryBlockReason = "DAMAGED_GOODS" or "CUSTOMER_NOT_AVAILABLE"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ExpenseExceptionStatus = "APPROVED_JUSTIFIED" or "REJECTED_UNJUSTIFIED"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of receiving verbose, unstructured text that a human must interpret, the backend now receives clear, deterministic signals it can immediately act on — allowing the business process to progress further downstream rather than stopping at the point where human intervention was previously required.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deep Dive Example: Customer Returns (As-Is vs. AI-Enhanced Flow)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let us consider a model company named Smart Sense Technologies (SST), a global manufacturer of smart security devices. Like many enterprises today, SST’s IT organization faces both challenges and opportunities driven by internal and external factors such as a rapidly evolving technology landscape, shifting customer expectations, and increasing business demand for speed and agility. To respond effectively and deliver optimal outcomes for its stakeholders, SST embarked on a digital transformation journey supported by SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). The organization leverages BTP to innovate and extend business capabilities, enabling greater process efficiency, faster time-to-market, and increased operational agility. To stay ahead of the competition, SST continuously evaluates and optimizes its end-to-end business processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the As-Is process, SST’s customer returns initiated in SAP Commerce Cloud are integrated with SAP S/4HANA using the standard &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://hub.sap.com/package/SAPHybrisCommerceIntegrationwithS4HANA/integrationflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Commerce Cloud Integration with SAP S/4HANA&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;. This package provides a ready-made integration flow that transmits return requests from Commerce Cloud to S/4HANA as ORDERS05 IDocs, establishing a reliable and widely adopted baseline for returns processing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_0-1765817257218.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352220i665BA72B8EEB7B22/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_0-1765817257218.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_0-1765817257218.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_1-1765817257244.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352219i58838ED2F4C90638/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_1-1765817257244.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_1-1765817257244.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This iflow sends the transactional data required to create the returns order in S/4HANA. Along with structured order attributes, it also forwards free-text return comments entered by the customer. These narrative descriptions are embedded in the IDoc and successfully persisted in the returns document, but they are not interpreted or acted upon automatically by the system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Read: &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/7b24a64d9d0941bda1afa753263d9e39/6222a7ef62294a45b437e4d2e99525b7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;For more background on the Sales &amp;amp; Return process integration using IDOC&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the IDoc level, two fields are particularly relevant in this context. E1EDP01-ABGRT carries the free-text return or cancellation description provided upstream, while E1EDP01-ABGRU represents the structured rejection or decision reason that drives subsequent processing in Sales and Returns Management. In real-world configurations, ABGRT is commonly populated by the inbound integration, whereas ABGRU is often left empty until a human has reviewed the return and made a decision.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_2-1765817257278.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352221iB079CF7EFD30764C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_2-1765817257278.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_2-1765817257278.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is also important to note that approval responsibilities may vary by landscape. In some scenarios, return approval may already occur in an upstream portal such as SAP Commerce Cloud in our example, while in others it is intentionally deferred to SAP S/4HANA. For the purpose of this example, we assume that the approval step is handled in S/4HANA. As a result, when the ORDERS05 IDoc arrives from Commerce Cloud, the return order is created with descriptive context (ABGRT) but without a decision code (ABGRU), causing the process to pause for human review.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As part of SST’s continuous improvement efforts, the IT organization is tasked with the responsibility to help the business improve its processes – with specific metrics such as cutting sales / return processing lead-time, improving accuracy, offering consistent customer experience. Considering this, SST’s integration architecture team proposes a solution leveraging BTP AI within Integration Suite iflow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_3-1765817257286.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352222iD548B52AC01FF010/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_3-1765817257286.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_3-1765817257286.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this scenario, SST extends the standard integration flow with a focused AI-based classification step executed in a post-exit iflow in SAP Integration Suite. The free-text return description (ABGRT) received from SAP Commerce Cloud is passed to an LLM using a tightly constrained prompt that maps narrative customer input to a single, predefined SAP rejection reason code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_4-1765817257307.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352224i0DA251A7E2BF758C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_4-1765817257307.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_4-1765817257307.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following figure shows the Post-exit iflow that is called from the main flow. This iflow uses AI adapter to call an LLM to convert the free-text customer rejection comments into a deterministic return code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_5-1765817257327.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352223i40771C9255099E7F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_5-1765817257327.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_5-1765817257327.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_6-1765817257344.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352226iD6F3A6CC24E611C6/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_6-1765817257344.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_6-1765817257344.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_7-1765817257349.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352225i07354000D58A6BA4/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_7-1765817257349.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_7-1765817257349.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here, we pass the prompt directly from the processing tab of the AI Adapter, with the rejection text as parameter, that is fetched from the incoming message from Commerce cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_8-1765817257365.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352227i2A832DC7ABAD94C9/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_8-1765817257365.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_8-1765817257365.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After deploying the post-exit iflow, next we proceed to test using a HTTP client (to mimic a message from SAP Commerce cloud). Here, rejection text is parameterized and fed from a variable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_9-1765817257393.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352230i7B989673ADA97E51/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_9-1765817257393.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_9-1765817257393.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The rejection text is passed as “Item arrived much later than agreed”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_0-1765818457859.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352250i6990E9A19504880C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_0-1765818457859.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_0-1765818457859.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the actual prompt that is sent to the LLM – after substitution of the rejection text, passed from the HTTP call.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_11-1765817257439.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352229i7697FAC3697CC67E/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_11-1765817257439.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_11-1765817257439.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following is the LLM response, with S4_RejectionReasonCode being populated, strictly adhering to the prompting made to the LLM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_12-1765817257456.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352232iB0B02BC49AA6A2E4/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_12-1765817257456.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_12-1765817257456.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Next, we use this LLM derived RejectionReasonCode to enrich the IDOC mapping, to populate E1EDP01-ABGRU.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_13-1765817257495.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352231iD54B57BC61872A32/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_13-1765817257495.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_13-1765817257495.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_14-1765817257518.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352233i47387932A2CD5DEF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="arunmaarirajha_kv_14-1765817257518.png" alt="arunmaarirajha_kv_14-1765817257518.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As demonstrated in the preceding steps, the extended integration flow now enriches the inbound ORDERS05 IDoc with a populated rejection reason code (ABGRU), derived from the customer’s free-text input (ABGRT) using AI-based reasoning and interpretation. With the decision code present at creation time, the returns document no longer stalls in an indeterminate state and can proceed through the standard S/4HANA returns process without waiting for manual interpretation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Depending on landscape design and process ownership, this semantic enrichment can also be taken a step further. Instead of—or in addition to—populating the IDoc, the same inferred outcome can be used to directly invoke standard SAP S/4HANA APIs such as the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/19d48293097f4a2589433856b034dfa5/4f5736c166ce4a2da425335751b52907.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Advanced Returns Management approval&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; service (API_CUSTOMER_RETURN_SRV) to explicitly release or reject the return order. This represents the post–human-action document state that would traditionally be reached only after a manual approval step.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Together, these patterns illustrate how introducing AI-driven interpretation at the integration layer allows unstructured customer intent to be converted into structured, actionable business signals at the point of entry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI in Integration: Why It Fits and How to Govern It&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1) Reasserted: The Integration platform’s timeless role as the enabler of Process Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In many enterprises, the integration layer, such as Integration Suite, serves as the natural ingestion point and middleware platform that facilitates transactions and orchestrates message flows between applications across the ERP landscape. Embedding GenAI-driven interpretation here fits naturally into CPI’s existing responsibilities: it allows the business meaning hidden inside narrative text to be converted into actionable signals before the request reaches the core ERP process. For integration architects and developers, this aligns perfectly with the integration layer’s role as the control point for routing, orchestration, and decisioning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When free-text descriptions are converted into deterministic attributes—such as &lt;EM&gt;return_reason_code&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;refund_flag&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;inspection_required&lt;/EM&gt;, or &lt;EM&gt;damage_classification&lt;/EM&gt;—CPI can now call the exact API operation that corresponds to the post-review document state. In other words, CPI can directly invoke the relevant API to post the document in the status it would have reached only after a human had read, approved, or actioned the text. This removes the need to always invoke a “pre-review” API and wait for downstream human review.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This shift eliminates traditional bottlenecks: manual interpretation steps, workflow inbox approvals, delays from human availability, and intermediate document states that halt progression. Because decisioning happens at the moment the request enters the landscape, CPI sends a clean, enriched, decision-ready payload to S/4HANA (or any backend), enabling the system to execute the correct business logic immediately.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rather than replacing human judgment, this pattern formalizes and codifies human insight into a governed, automated, and fully auditable integration layer. This is why, in this scenario, AI belongs in the integration layer: This architectural capability empowers CPI to transform narrative inputs into deterministic, actionable signals, enabling downstream process automation while keeping the ERP core clean.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2) Clean Core by Design&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Placing the intelligence in SAP BTP ensures that ERP systems remain standard, maintainable, and free from any text-interpretation logic. This approach avoids enhancing S/4HANA to parse unstructured text or extending it to process AI-derived attributes—both of which introduce long-term complexity and technical debt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead, ERP systems receive clean, structured, enriched payloads through the REST/OData APIs designed for standard CRUD operations. This keeps backend applications stable and upgrade-friendly, while positioning the intelligence in a layer that is flexible, governed, and purpose-built to support innovation. By keeping the semantics outside the ERP and feeding it deterministic attributes through established integration patterns, the core remains clean by design.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3) A Perfect Problem–Solution Fit for AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Interpretation of natural-language free text is inherently a language-understanding problem — a task that humans have traditionally handled because it requires context, nuance, and inference. GenAI models excel exactly in this domain: extracting meaning, identifying intent, and classifying the actions implied by narrative input.&lt;BR /&gt;Once the integration layer converts this text into deterministic attributes, every subsequent step becomes standard ERP automation — pricing behaviour, blocking, approvals, follow-on documents, status progression, and more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4) High Business Value When Applied to High-Impact Scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A clear business value emerges when Generative AI is applied to the right type of problem—specifically, scenarios where narrative text shapes important decisions. While many processes contain free-text fields, the highest value appears when unstructured descriptions create friction, ambiguity, or costly delays that materially affect customer satisfaction, compliance, or financial outcomes. The architectural decision to integrate an LLM must be strictly justified by a measurable Return on Investment (ROI), as these models operate on a metered consumption model. Consequently, the value delivered must always outweigh the cost of the service call, meaning GenAI should be applied only to high-impact, high-volume scenarios where the operational expense of manual intervention significantly exceeds the cost of an LLM call.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Typical examples of processes (as previously mentioned) that run at scale, carry high consequence, and often suffer from a high cost of delay include: Customer Returns (RMAs), delivery exceptions, and expense justifications. In these situations, shifting the interpretation logic to the point of ingestion (within the Integration Suite) fundamentally reshapes the flow. Processing accelerates because items no longer wait for manual review; accuracy and consistency improve through uniform, model-driven interpretation; and downstream data quality is strengthened. This leads to tangible improvements in efficiency and decision reliability, with human attention reserved for genuine edge cases. Scenarios that combine high repetition, high consequence, and high ambiguity are the strongest candidates for this GenAI-driven interpretation, whereas traditional deterministic approaches remain the appropriate and cost-effective choice when these characteristics are absent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5) Auditability and Control Built In&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While in our deep-dive example, we directly applied the prompt at the AI Adapter, it is also possible to build the request body, incorporating orchestration configurations provided out of the box with BTP AI Core (GenAI Hub), in the form of LLM guard-railing steps such as prompt templating, data masking, model configuration, and so on. Also, it is a best practice to make use of prompt templates, to make use of reusability. With such controls in place, the LLM response can stay relevant, reliable, and responsible (3 “R”s &lt;SPAN&gt;that constitute the key pillars of&amp;nbsp;SAP's AI&amp;nbsp;strategy&lt;/SPAN&gt;) ensuring that business process outcomes are explainable and auditable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These details about Orchestration workflow can be found in this &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/orchestration-workflow-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP help portal page&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’d also recommend that you read &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/invoking-llm-from-cloud-integration-responsibly-made-easy-with-generative/ba-p/14176222" target="_blank"&gt;this blog&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; by my colleague Daniil, where Orchestration workflow in Generative AI Hub is used to invoke an LLM in a secure, GDPR-compliant way, from within an integration flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By leveraging SAP BTP AI services within SAP Integration Suite, organizations can elevate integration from a transport layer to a semantic processing layer—converting human intent into deterministic business signals at the point of entry. This approach enables Straight-Through Processing, automating decision-making while preserving governance, auditability, and maintainability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Combining Integration and AI opens up new possibilities for business process efficiency.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The New York Times reported the average price of a pound of ground beef was around&amp;nbsp;$&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;6.32 in September. This is an increase of about 11−14% from the previous year, driven primarily by a smaller U.S. cattle herd.&amp;nbsp; As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation's beef supply even as demand remains strong.&amp;nbsp; As of July, USDA&amp;nbsp;data&amp;nbsp;shows there were 28.7 million beef cows across the US, the lowest number in decades.&amp;nbsp; Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, tariffs on beef from Brazil, America's largest import source, may be curbing supplies.&amp;nbsp; The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports sat at 76.4% in September,&amp;nbsp;according&amp;nbsp;to the American Farm Bureau Federation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You may be asking if spending on SAP Business Network reflects these economic factors. Here is what network data shows.&amp;nbsp; Two meat classes are traded on SBN:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Processed Meat &amp;amp; Poultry&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Processed meat has undergone additional treatment beyond basic cutting or packaging. Examples include deli meats (ham, turkey breast slices, roast beef), sausages, hot dogs, bratwurst, bacon, chicken nuggets or patties.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Minimally Processed Meat &amp;amp; Poultry&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These products undergo only basic processing needed to make them safe or convenient.&amp;nbsp; Examples include raw chicken breasts, thighs, or wings, raw turkey or whole chickens, and ground beef or ground turkey.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Beef cannot be analyzed in isolation until we extend demand trends to level 4 of UNSPSC.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="processed.png" style="width: 794px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344549i4D0F34A06701BC8D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="processed.png" alt="processed.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There’s $364M in spend of processed meat on the network.&amp;nbsp; There was a large spike spread over Q3 with spend increase 76.4% compared to the prior quarter.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="min processed.png" style="width: 800px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344550iEE57C8A462079285/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="min processed.png" alt="min processed.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The plot thickens however when viewing minimally processed meats.&amp;nbsp; Minimally processed meat spend was $578M and relatively flat with an extreme spike in September.&amp;nbsp; Q3 spend increased 43% compared to Q2.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Growth.png" style="width: 762px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344552iDBF1EA7D8C276DFA/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Growth.png" alt="Growth.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Analyst&lt;STRONG&gt;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;have&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;obse&lt;/STRONG&gt;rved differences in behavior of both classes.&amp;nbsp; Analysts say:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;minimally processed meat has steadier baseline demand but more volatility due to supply constraints, inflation, and contract timing.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;processed meat shows steady, healthy growth driven by convenience and value-added products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SBN data appears to support both of these observations as exhibited by the following:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Steady growth of processed meat from February – September with few dips&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Processed meat less volatile. No extreme spikes or crashes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Minimally processed meat is more volatile. Large swings early year from December – February.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Minimally processed meat shows occasional extreme spikes. The 147M spike in September.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Minimally processed demand tied more to supply chain fluctuations. &amp;nbsp;Jumps and reversals in monthly data.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <title>Integration Advisor – Use Custom XSLT as MAG</title>
    <updated>2025-12-15T18:06:27.350000+01:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I am excited to announce our latest feature: Within the Integration Advisor capability of SAP Integration Suite, you can now define a Mapping Guideline (MAG) using a custom XSLT file. In this blog post, I will provide a brief overview of this new feature and explain how to use it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1072960254" id="toc-hId-1766381455"&gt;Motivation&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Integration Advisor, through its MAG Editor, provides a tool that enables Business Experts or Integration Developers to implement mappings between different message structures. The MAG Editor is specifically designed for B2B interactions and includes numerous value-added features, particularly useful for handling EDI messages (such as qualification concept, code value mapping, date-time conversion, and proposal service). One of the key advantages of the MAG Editor is its graphical mapping approach, which empowers Business Experts without developer skills to define mappings with minimal assistance from Integration Developers (following a no-code/low-code approach).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But there are scenarios where customers prefer to use a custom XSLT file instead of a graphical mapping. Such use cases include:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Significant structural differences between the source and target message that cannot be easily resolved by a graphical mapping editor like the MAG Editor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The need for additional pre- or post-processing steps (in addition to a graphical mapping) that can be handled more efficiently using XSLT.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A desire to reuse an existing XSLT mapping file, for instance, from another mapping platform such as SAP Process Integration.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the past, this functionality could already be achieved through a separate mapping step (of type XSLT) in Cloud Integration or via a Process Direct configuration in Trading Partner Management (TPM).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Through the SAP Customer Influence program, we received the requirement to enable custom XSLT mappings directly within Integration Advisor (see &lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/298620" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Link&lt;/A&gt;). The advantage of this approach is the ability to maintain all graphical and XSLT mapping artifacts in one place, leverage Integration Advisor's versioning capabilities, and reach a unified configuration in&amp;nbsp;Trading Partner Management.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-876446749" id="toc-hId-1569867950"&gt;Feature Description&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When creating a new Mapping Guideline (MAG), you now have the option to choose between a Graphical MAG (either Standard or Overlay) and an XSLT MAG. When selecting the XSLT option, the MAG is defined in the traditional way by selecting Source and Target&amp;nbsp;Message Implementation Guidelines (MIGs).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After the MAG is created, you can upload your custom XSLT file. (Please note that the MAG must be saved before the XSLT file is applied.) The screenshot below illustrates the appearance of an XSLT MAG.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="screenshot-1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347204iBB74EF9E4AF554C1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="screenshot-1.jpg" alt="screenshot-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can view the content of the uploaded XSLT file, download it, and re-upload an updated XSLT file if needed. Additionally, you can use the Simulate MAG feature in the same way as for a Graphical MAG. We also plan to introduce an option to validate the XSLT syntax of your file soon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please note that it is not possible to edit the content of the XSLT file directly within Integration Advisor. If updates are required, you can make the necessary changes in your preferred XSLT editor and re-upload the XSLT file. Furthermore, certain configurations available for Graphical MAGs, such as Global Parameters, Shared Code, Duplicate Target Nodes, or Pretransformation, are not applicable to XSLT MAGs and are therefore not offered in the UI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And one final comment regarding the specific XSLT in the screenshot above: The Ship Notice message (856) from ASC X12 frequently requires a very specific structure for the HL Segment Groups in terms of order and identifiers. It is a well-known issue that graphical mapping editors, such as the MAG Editor, often face&amp;nbsp;challenges in producing all the required details. In such cases, we recommend utilizing an additional XSLT as post-processing - see this blog post (&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/integration-blog-posts/taming-the-x12-856-message-in-sap-integration-advisor-a-step-by-step-guide/ba-p/14115410" target="_self"&gt;Link&lt;/A&gt;) for a detailed explanation. The example above illustrates how this XSLT would appear as an XSLT MAG.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-876446749" id="toc-hId-1373354445"&gt;Two Architectural Assumptions&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this new feature is to achieve closer integration of custom XSLT mappings within the Integration Advisor framework. In this section, I would like to highlight two key design decisions made to support this purpose. If you plan to use this feature, please keep these two aspects in mind:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. An XSLT MAG maps between a Source and a Target MIG&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Explanation: Similar to current Graphical MAGs, you need to define a Source MIG and a Target MIG for your custom XSLT mapping.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reasoning:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Aligns with the current principal design of Integration Advisor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensures seamless integration into Trading Partner Management (if TPM is utilized).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Allows MAG Simulation to function similarly to Graphical MAGs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. An XSLT MAG works with Integration Advisor Payload Format (ICA format)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Explanation:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Background: We call the payload format after applying MIG preproc.xslt the ICA payload format. This format differs from the original XML payload format (called CPI payload format) in several aspects, most notably added qualifier suffixes but also other processing simplifications (e.g., the inclusion of an extra node CONTENT for nodes based on XSD Simple Content).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Similar to Graphical MAGs, the custom XSLT shall map between the ICA payload format of the Source MIG and the ICA payload format of the Target MIG.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reasoning:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Aligns with the current principal design of Integration Advisor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensures seamless integration into Trading Partner Management (if TPM is used).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Maintains consistent processing steps in Integration Flows within Cloud Integration (if TPM is not used), allowing the same Integration Flow logic as for Graphical MAGs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Advantage:&amp;nbsp;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Leverages Integration Advisor's value-added features, such as the powerful MIG qualification concept, which could also simplify a custom XSLT mapping.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enables the use of Extended Semantic Payload Validation based on your MIG.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;(Potential) Disadvantage:&amp;nbsp;If you already have an XSLT file that maps between standard XML formats (CPI format or PO format), you may need to make some adjustments to work with the ICA payload format.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additional info: The Integration Advisor Payload Format is depicted by the MIG structure you see in MIG Editor or MAG Editor. By clicking on a node, you can navigate to the Technical Information section to find the exact XML Node Name and the exact Node XPath, which need to be used to address a node. See screenshot below for an example.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="screenshot-2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347205i37C8533D837F0F8C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="screenshot-2.jpg" alt="screenshot-2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If these two architectural assumptions do not align with your use case, you can still utilize the XSLT mapping feature of Cloud Integration or the Process Direct option in TPM. In such cases, you have greater flexibility in your design decisions but will not benefit from the closer integration with Integration Advisor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1176840940"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consumption in Trading Partner Management and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Integration &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When you export the runtime artifacts of an XSLT MAG, there is no difference compared to a Graphical MAG. The runtime artifacts include a mapping XSLT file, which is named according to your MAG Name. This exported MAG XSLT file contains the XSLT definitions you uploaded in your XSLT MAG. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Using this approach, you can consume an XSLT MAG in &lt;/SPAN&gt;Trading Partner Management as well as in Cloud Integration in the same way as you would consume a Graphical MAG.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-483419739" id="toc-hId-980327435"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With this new feature, you can create a&amp;nbsp;Mapping Guideline in Integration Advisor based on your own custom XSLT file. This provides greater flexibility where needed while still leveraging Integration Advisor features such as versioning and integration with TPM. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Looking ahead, we plan to introduce an additional standard feature in TPM/IA that will allow you to combine multiple MAGs in a mapping sequence. This would enable scenarios where you can combine a Graphical MAG with additional XSLT pre- and/or post-processing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-286906234" id="toc-hId-783813930"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Further reading&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/integration-advisor-overview-of-components-for-building-b2b-integration/ba-p/13512772" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/integration-advisor-overview-of-components-for-...&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/integration-content-advisor-create-a-customized-interface-using-mig-editor/ba-p/13354699" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/integration-content-advisor-create-a-customized...&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/integration-content-advisor-create-a-mapping-using-mag-editor/ba-p/13424264" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/integration-content-advisor-create-a-mapping-using-mag-editor/ba-p/13424264&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/integration-blog-posts/taming-the-x12-856-message-in-sap-integration-advisor-a-step-by-step-guide/ba-p/14115410" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/integration-blog-posts/taming-the-x12-856-message-in-sap-integration-advisor-a-step-by-step-guide/ba-p/14115410&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi GAKJ,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks for the link and the details shared above. The above option is recommended only when you have cloud.sap migration. As you see the help page, it runs into multiple problems if not take care of it. I would not recommend if customers are using ondemand.com as it clearly states not to use it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="nageshcaparthy_0-1765818793649.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352251iE796FA3015289475/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="nageshcaparthy_0-1765818793649.png" alt="nageshcaparthy_0-1765818793649.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, Global ID is a pre-req for Joule and hence this a mandatory activity at this point of time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nagesh&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi, I´m afraid that material packing data details are currently not exposed by any PAPI at the moment, so I suggest you use Customer Influence portal at&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/campaign/3537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/campaign/3537&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;to share your requirements and request it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope it helps! Br, Manoel&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Employee trust in the performance management process depends heavily on transparency, fairness, and the ability to raise concerns. A well-designed Grievance Process in SAP SuccessFactors Performance and Goals Management (PMGM) ensures that employees can formally challenge or seek clarification on performance outcomes, while HR and management can handle these cases in a structured, auditable way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog explains how to design and configure a grievance process in SuccessFactors PMGM using:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Performance Management (PM) Templates&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Route Maps&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Business Rules&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Add Review Steps upon form routing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Dynamically control field visibility, editability, and required status&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Build a Grievance Process in PMGM?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A grievance process in PMGM enables organizations to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Provide a formal appeal mechanism for performance ratings&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensure consistency and compliance across regions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Improve employee confidence in performance outcomes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Maintain auditability of all actions and comments&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduce off-system emails and manual escalations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of managing grievances outside SuccessFactors, organizations can embed the process directly into the performance form lifecycle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;High-Level Grievance Process Flow&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A typical grievance flow in PMGM looks like this:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Employee Submits Grievance Request&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additional Review Steps Triggered&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;HR / Grievance Committee Review&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Final Decision Communicated&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Form Completed &amp;amp; Locked&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This flow is achieved using a combination of PM template fields, route maps, and intelligent business rules.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1: Configuring the PM Template for Grievance Handling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key Fields to Add in the PM Template&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Add custom fields in the relevant sections (Summary / Overall Rating / Custom Section)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":light_bulb:"&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; Best Practice: Place employee-facing grievance fields in a separate custom section for clarity.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SachinPachauri_0-1765819232589.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352260i69DDBEE0A0217951/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SachinPachauri_0-1765819232589.png" alt="SachinPachauri_0-1765819232589.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2: Designing the Route Map with Conditional Grievance Steps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Route Maps control who sees the form and when.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SachinPachauri_9-1765819466129.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352269i0C9C537521EA3EF8/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SachinPachauri_9-1765819466129.png" alt="SachinPachauri_9-1765819466129.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enable &lt;STRONG&gt;“Hidden Until Rule Execution”&lt;/STRONG&gt; option in all the route steps which you want to use in the business rule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SachinPachauri_2-1765819284161.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352262iC535AFB0DBF64566/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SachinPachauri_2-1765819284161.png" alt="SachinPachauri_2-1765819284161.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3: Add Review Steps Upon Form Routing (Business Rule)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most powerful capabilities in PMGM is dynamically adding route map steps when specific conditions are met.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SachinPachauri_5-1765819335289.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352265iF775429472C5F2F4/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SachinPachauri_5-1765819335289.png" alt="SachinPachauri_5-1765819335289.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SachinPachauri_4-1765819329366.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352264i63CD4253E45B29A2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SachinPachauri_4-1765819329366.png" alt="SachinPachauri_4-1765819329366.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4: Controlling Field Visibility, Editability, and Mandatory Status Using Business Rules&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A grievance process requires different users to see different fields at different times.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This is achieved using Business Rules for Field Properties.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SachinPachauri_6-1765819383707.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352266i2CBF8B4F05D01D9B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SachinPachauri_6-1765819383707.png" alt="SachinPachauri_6-1765819383707.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5: In the&amp;nbsp;Assign Rules in Talent&amp;nbsp;admin tool, you've assigned the rule to the&amp;nbsp;Field Change&amp;nbsp;trigger.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SachinPachauri_8-1765819409852.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352268iA175EC92CD53DCEE/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SachinPachauri_8-1765819409852.png" alt="SachinPachauri_8-1765819409852.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the business rule is assigned to a template, Admin can launch a form and meet the conditions to trigger the additional steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reporting &amp;amp;
