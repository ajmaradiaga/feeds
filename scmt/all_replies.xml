    <content>&lt;P&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp;S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP&amp;nbsp;S/4HANA 2025 were released to the SAP customer base on October 8, 2025.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP Platform 2025 is the technology platform underlying the release 2025 of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP&amp;nbsp;S/4HANA and is shipped as part of these products, supporting only SAP HANA database with full exploitation of its advanced capabilities. In addition,&amp;nbsp; ABAP Platform 2025 is part of &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3568504/E" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp;S/4HANA Foundation 2025&lt;/A&gt; for SAP HANA-only Add-Ons.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP Platform 2025 is not shipped as a standalone product. ABAP Platform 2025 consists of the AS ABAP,&amp;nbsp; the ABAP development tools for Eclipse, and several additional technology components which are required to run SAP&amp;nbsp;S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Previous versions of SAP S/4HANA Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA such as 1610, 1709, 1809, 1909, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 can be upgraded directly to the 2025 release, which is based on ABAP Platform 2025 (corresponding to&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/ABENNEWS-81.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP_BASIS 816&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766649611"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;Product Highlights&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="2025_abap_platform_highlights.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351817i005DC626988E769A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2025_abap_platform_highlights.jpg" alt="2025_abap_platform_highlights.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570136106"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;Presentation&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This presentation provides the SAP official external slide deck, just click on it to view:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A title="ABAP Platform 2025 - Overview and Product Highlights" href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/12/a43c7800-317f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="abap_platform_2025.jpg" style="width: 723px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351818i56128BEDA971EB19/image-dimensions/723x406?v=v2" width="723" height="406" role="button" title="abap_platform_2025.jpg" alt="abap_platform_2025.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373622601"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;Overview&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP Platform 2025 delivers innovations for the ABAP stack in different areas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1306191815"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;Clean core development&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In August 2025, SAP enhanced its extensibility guidelines by introducing the new &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2024/09/20aece06-d87e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Clean core extensibility white paper&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;. The sustainable and upgrade-safe ABAP extensibility model in SAP&amp;nbsp;S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP&amp;nbsp;S/4HANA fully relies on SAP clean core guiding principles, aiming to decouple custom extensions from SAP standard whenever possible. The refined SAP guidance for extensibility replaces binary clean core decisions with a more nuanced evaluation of classic ABAP extensions based on the clean core level concept. Evolving from the previous 3-tier model, the new extensibility model categorizes extensions into four levels (A, B, C, and D) and provides rules for ABAP classic extensions to meet the clean core level qualifications. Following this new clean core extensibility guidance the&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/10/52e0cd9b-497e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ABAP extensibility guide&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;was updated with technical guidelines to support the clean core level concept. The ABAP extensibility model was changed from 3-tier model to ABAP Cloud development (level A) and classic ABAP development (levels B, C and D).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The overall clean core guidance remained unchanged: always striving for the highest possible level of extensibility. ABAP Cloud is the SAP’s recommended development model for all new custom extensions in SAP S/4HANA private cloud and on-premise systems, whereby the classic ABAP extensibility can still be used to reach clean core, with a focus on upgrade-stability and code quality. This enables SAP customers and partners to transition to a clean core incrementally and at their own speed. SAP provides guidance for ABAP clean core development by offering a recommended list of APIs (so-called “classic APIs”) to be used in classic ABAP development. For governance of ABAP clean core development, the ABAP test cockpit (ATC) now supports the clean core level concept with new ATC checks (see the blog post &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/abap-test-cockpit-atc-recommendations-for-governance-of-clean-core-abap/ba-p/14186130" target="_blank"&gt;ABAP test cockpit (ATC) recommendations for governance of clean core ABAP development&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;). For governance of ABAP development for clean core in SAP S/4HANA private cloud or on-premise systems the remote &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/11/38e238f7-2b7f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ATC in SAP BTP ABAP environment&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; is the SAP recommended approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1109678310"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule for Developers,&amp;nbsp; ABAP AI capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Joule for Developers, ABAP AI capabilities are now key components and an integral part of AI-assisted ABAP Cloud development, also facilitating custom code transformation from ECC to SAP S/4HANA. The capabilities supporting developer tasks include Joule copilot in ABAP development tools for Eclipse, predictive code completion, code explanation and unit test generation for ABAP and ABAP CDS, app and service generation (including RAP BO generation), predictive business logic for RAP BOs, and OData consumption. The provided ABAP AI SDK, powered by Intelligent Scenario Lifecycle Management (ISLM), can be utilized for the implementation of AI capabilities in custom applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The custom code migration capabilities include docs chat for questions around custom code migration and S/4HANA simplifications, explanation of business purpose and processing logic of legacy code (ABAP reports), explanation of S/4HANA-related ATC findings in custom code, along with resolution recommendations based on S/4HANA simplification items and cookbooks (see the blog post &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-joule-for-developers-expands-to-private-cloud-accelerating-abap/ba-p/14237958" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Joule for Developers Expands to Private Cloud: Accelerating ABAP Innovation and Transformation&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-913164805"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another major investment area in the 2025 release is the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model, which powers modern development in both ABAP Cloud and classic ABAP, enabling the creation of delightful transactional SAP Fiori apps as well as local and web APIs. This release delivers new features to accelerate and enhance the development with RAP, including new generators to boost efficiency, support of CDS table entities as persistence layer, various capabilities for SAP Fiori elements-based UIs, such as collaborative draft, cross-BO scenarios, tree views, and event-driven side effects, as well as end-to-end extensibility options.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;New ABAP Cloud generators for creating OData UI services with RAP BOs (with one or more entities) from scratch, with or without AI assistance, or for generating custom UI service based on RAP BO interface are provided. ABAP CDS table entities can be used as active persistence layer for managed RAP BOs without draft, replacing classic dictionary database tables.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enhancements for building of SAP Fiori elements-based apps with RAP include the collaborative draft handling, which allows multiple users to work simultaneously and collaboratively on the same draft instance of an entity without blocking one another. You can now also build SAP Fiori UIs that use multiple RAP BOs interacting with each other. These cross-BO scenarios rely on cross-BO transactional enablement, where the entities of the participating RAP BOs are linked through so-called cross-BO associations. Read-only and editable tree view supports displaying and manipulating hierarchical data in SAP Fiori UIs, with options for drag and drop, cut and paste, reordering, and cascading delete. Event-driven RAP side effects enable asynchronous updates in SAP Fiori UIs. When such a specific RAP business event is raised, the associated side effect is triggered, and the defined targets are reloaded in the UI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The privileged context can now be propagated in subsequent Entity Manipulation Language (EML) requests in reading and modifying operation. Further enhancement for the behavior definitions and the behavior pools are provided with this release.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-716651300"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP development tools for Eclipse (ADT)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Various enhancements are provided in ABAP development tools for Eclipse for ABAP development, RAP and ABAP CDS related development aspects, testing and troubleshooting, as well as overall IDE and productivity improvements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Refactoring support for ABAP classes and interfaces was improved by activation of renaming changes by default, validation of new names and displaying long texts of exceptions. The new where-used dialog enables prefiltering of search results to focus on usages relevant for the concrete use case. There is a new property&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;abaplv&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;to filter object searches with the ABAP language version. There are new editors like for example for working with software component relations, Adobe Forms or maintaining intelligent scenarios and intelligent scenarios models which are required to run a solution based on generative AI. It is possible to create and edit CDS table entities and create for them behavior definitions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the area of ABAP unit tests, method calls in test classes can now be highlighted in different colors to distinguish their method contexts. Quick actions allow tests to be launched or templates for test classes to be inserted with a single mouse click. The failed assertions and status of test methods can be displayed directly in the source code editor. The unit tests can be rerun with coverage and coverage results can be cleared in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;ABAP Coverage&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;view. Additionally, there is a new AMDP Test Double Framework, and the CDS Test Double Framework now supports CDS hierarchy views.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the ABAP debugger, it is now possible to display the memory consumption of a debugged ABAP program in the new &lt;EM&gt;ABAP Memory&lt;/EM&gt; (Debugger) view. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;ABAP Memory Snapshot&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;view lists all memory snapshots, which can be opened in the editor to show memory objects ranked by size. These views make it easier to analyze the memory usage of an ABAP application. Internal tables can now be easily compared using the table comparison tool within the ABAP debugger. Beyond this, the ABAP debugger can now consider variables with hidden values (for sensitive data), display variables of type JSON, and show component groups for nested structures in the &lt;EM&gt;Variables&lt;/EM&gt; view. Collaborative error analysis is supported by export/import of ABAP Cross Trace results to/from JSON file or export of short dumps as ZIP file in the &lt;EM&gt;ABAP Runtime Error Viewer&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond this there are also enhancements in transport management for adding an object to a transport or searching and grouping transport requests.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-520137795"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Language&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The modern, declarative, and expression-oriented ABAP language allows writing simple and concise ABAP code through features such as inline declarations and constructor expressions. Advanced operations for internal tables include grouping, filtering, and the CORRESPONDING( ) operator. The cloud-optimized version “&lt;EM&gt;ABAP for Cloud Development&lt;/EM&gt;” is used for ABAP Cloud development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are further enhancements for internal tables, including support for arbitrary logical expressions and equality conditions, as well as harmonization of table expressions and READ TABLE statement. &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/random-numbers-and-probability-distributions-in-the-abap-environments-for/ba-p/14173266" target="_blank"&gt;New ABAP system classes for probability distributions&lt;/A&gt; are provided, enabling the generation of random number and the calculation of quantile, probabilities, and other aspects. These classes support various discrete and continuous distributions. This release also delivers enhancements for expressions and functions, as well as for transformations, such as the new domain XSDGEO for serializing and deserializing spatial data between the Extended Well-Known Binary (EWKB) representation and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;GeoJSON&amp;nbsp;format.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-323624290"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP HANA-centric optimizations &amp;amp; Data Integration scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Modern ABAP development on SAP HANA has been enhanced with several advanced, database-centric features also enriching data integration scenarios. Recent innovations in data integration focus on data exposure, including ABAP-managed database procedures for advanced read scenarios.&amp;nbsp; With CDS updatable view entities it is now possible to wrap existing DDIC database tables (or CDS table entities) and expose a native CDS signature, which can be used with ABAP SQL in combination with DCL-based access control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the consumption side, new write scenarios, the use of static CDS external entities, and the possibility to create ABAP CDS models based on imported CDS models make it easier than ever to integrate external data seamlessly into an ABAP CDS view stack.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additional enhancements, such as CDS table entities to define and manage SAP HANA database tables as native CDS repository objects, a CDS generation wizard to simplify and automate the creation of hierarchically structured data in ABAP CDS, and AI-powered CDS Explain to get semantical context information about CDS entities further brighten the ABAP development landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-127110785"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Embedded analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;For embedded analytics scenarios it is now possible to expedite development workflow using ABAP Cloud generator wizards for creation of multidimensional analysis apps, Review Booklet apps, or native CDS hierarchy definitions. With the introduction of reusable measures and filters, the key figures, measures, filters and many more features can now be defined centrally, based on user needs to better manage and align analytical reporting. They can also be utilized in CDS view entities to ensure homogenous definition of complex calculations and unification of coherences of the running business.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--144634089"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Event Enablement &amp;amp; Business Events&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The event-driven architecture of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and&amp;nbsp;SAP S/4HANA is strengthened, and the interoperability across enterprise solutions is improved through seamless integration with SAP Event Mesh Advanced Plan and support of SAP Cloud Application Event Hub to consume events published by SAP Order Management Foundation on SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The event-driven processing and monitoring was enhanced with new outbound event filtering, enabling selective publishing based on configurable criteria, and dynamic topics in SAP Event Mesh Advanced Plan for more efficient routing. Operational transparency was improved through comprehensive event logging, including local capture and logging of successfully processed events. Events of the same type and object within a session can now be grouped as activities, improving traceability and reducing monitoring noise. Together, these features provide a scalable and well-governed foundation for event-driven architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--341147594"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Process integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; &amp;amp; Connectivity&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key highlights of process integration include a robust OData service consumption model with Swagger UI preview and advanced OData V4 capabilities, such as bulk processing and asynchronous communication integrated with AIF. The API governance and communication management was enhanced by introducing Communication Targets within Communication Arrangements, enabling more granular control over connectivity endpoints. API lifecycle management is improved through API-to-package assignment and the ability to create API packages for better organization across API types. Additionally, OData-based access to Communication Management data increases automation, transparency, and integration with external tools.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additional connectivity improvements include outbound communication enablement via HTTP and RFC, support for setting the AIR key as a custom HTTP header in SOAP requests for more secure message handling, direct push-based data exchange between ABAP systems via RFC, and SSE support in the ABAP HTTP client and server for efficient real-time event delivery in distributed scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--537661099"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#666699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key user extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further improvements are provided for key user extensibility. It is now possible to generate a Fiori elements application for a custom business object with just one click and maintain behavior extensions for SAP-provided RAP business objects using key user extensibility.

TIH attribute and CoC Comp/Skills content is not editable via JPB?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Can you please confirm that TIH &lt;U&gt;Behaviour&lt;/U&gt; content is not exposed anywhere in the system, beyond a Performance Management Form? If so, what's the best approach to assess an Attribute against a mapped behaviour for current role?

As a result, organizations are shifting from traditional hiring practices to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Skills-Based Hiring&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What is Skills-Based Hiring?&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;A skills-based approach means that hiring decisions are made based on a candidate’s skills and ability to perform a job—rather than solely on formal qualifications such as education or previous job titles listed on their résumé or CV.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Why does Skills-Based Hiring Matters?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The world of work is evolving rapidly. Organizations today face unprecedented challenges—labour shortages, digital transformation, and the need for agility.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Skills-based hiring helps businesses focus on what truly matters: the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;capabilities required to deliver outcomes&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, not just credentials.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With a skills-based approach, organizations can address not only their &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;current talent needs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; but also &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;long-term workforce strategies&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. It helps anticipate future requirements and stay ahead of the competition.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Benefits of Skill-Based Hiring&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase workforce diversity&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; by expanding talent pools and removing unconscious bias&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accelerate hiring decisions and streamline recruitment &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;by reducing time to fill&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Boost productivity&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;and reduce cost&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; by aligning the right skills with the right roles&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Improve transparency for candidates&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; by increasing visibility on role selection criteria&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enhance fairness and compliance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; through more equitable, data-driven decisions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Strong capabilities in SAP Fieldglass&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fieldglass has introduced powerful innovations to make skills-based hiring a reality:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-Assisted Job Posting Creation: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Generative AI now helps craft job descriptions and translate them into multiple languages, ensuring global reach and consistency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-powered Recommended Qualifications: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Machine learning suggests relevant skills and qualifications for job postings based on historical data and market trends.

Instead of rigid templates, companies can tailor skill assessments to match specific roles or project needs, improving precision in evaluating contingent workers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Skill Benchmarking Analytics: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Search jobs and skills in any industry, city and county to run side-by-side comparison in a location simulation to identify the best place to hire.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Analytics &amp;amp; Insights: Driving Smarter Workforce Decisions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Skills-based hiring is only as effective as the insights behind it. SAP Fieldglass provides advanced analytics that go beyond simple reporting—offering predictive intelligence to shape workforce strategies. Organisations can access &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;skill gap dashboards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to identify critical shortages, leverage &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;benchmarking tools&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to compare candidate capabilities against role requirements and use &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;trend analysis&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to forecast future skill demands. These insights empower HR and procurement teams to make data-driven decisions, prioritise upskilling initiatives, and optimise sourcing strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How It Fits into Total Workforce Strategy Picture&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Skills-based hiring isn’t just a recruitment trend—it’s a cornerstone of &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Total Workforce Management (TWM)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. With nearly &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;50% of the workforce now contingent&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, organisations need visibility and control across all worker types: full-time employees, freelancers, contractors, and service providers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fieldglass, integrated with SAP SuccessFactors, delivers:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Unified Data Models&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for internal and external workers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Centralised Visibility&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; into skills, positions, and requisitions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Compliance Automation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to manage global labour regulations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Analytics for Skill Gaps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to inform upskilling and reskilling strategies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This synergy breaks down silos between HR and Procurement, enabling organisations to optimise cost, reduce risk, and respond quickly to market changes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fieldglass continues to innovate with:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-Enhanced Candidate Recommendations: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Leverage AI to identify top candidates faster by analyzing skills, experience, and fit.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Centralize qualifications: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Consolidate fragmented qualification libraries into a centralised, AI-enabled hub, ensuring consistency and transparency across all buyer networks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enhanced Talent Pool Connectivity: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Seamlessly connect direct sourcing with talent pools for proactive candidate engagement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These capabilities position SAP Fieldglass as a leader in workforce transformation—helping organisations win the race for skills in a competitive market.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In conclusion, if you want to build a Future-Proofing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Build a workforce ready for emerging technologies and roles. With the enough agility. Nearly 90% of HR leaders believe that up to half of their workforce will need to be reskilled in the next five years due to AI uptake alone.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ready to embrace skills-based hiring?

SAP TechEd Berlinとの強力な連携：海を越えた「完璧な伴走者」&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;ASUG Tech Connectは、今年、SAP TechEdと**「完璧な伴走者（The perfect companions）」&lt;STRONG&gt;であると明確に定義されました。これは、&lt;/STRONG&gt;「北米における公式なSAP TechEdツアーイベント」**として、以下の3点でグローバルイベントと完全に同期しているためです。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;コンテンツの共有（ハンズオン）：&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP TechEd Berlinで発表された技術セッションやハンズオン資料が、そのまま北米会場でも提供されました。例えば、生成AIやFioriアプリ開発のセッションでは、「SAP TechEd Berlinからのハンズオンを試す」という案内が含まれており、北米にいながらベルリンと同じ技術体験が可能となっています。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;認定資格の提供：&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;会場では「SAP Build Developer」や「SAP Generative AI Developer」といった最新のSAP認定資格を、追加費用なしで取得できる機会が提供されました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;リアルタイムの連携：&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;キーノートでは、SAPのMuhammad Alam氏がベルリンのSAP TechEd会場から中継で参加。物理的な距離を超えて、両イベントが一体的なメッセージを発信していることが強調されました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1502705281"&gt;2. キーノートの核心：技術よりも「人」を変革せよ&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;イベントのハイライトであるキーノートは、初日の「オープニング」と3日目の「パートナー・顧客事例」の2部構成で行われました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ここでASUG CEOのGeoff Scott氏とSAPのリーダーたちが発信したのは、単なる新機能の紹介にとどまらない、私たちのキャリアと組織の存続に関わる強烈なメッセージでした。ここが、技術発表中心のSAP TechEdとの最も大きな違いです。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1435274495"&gt;「変化の速度は、もう二度と遅くならない」&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;まず共有したいのは、イベント全体を通して繰り返し引用された、現代を象徴するフレーズです。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;「変化の速度はかつてないほど速く、かつ今後これほど遅くなることは二度とない」&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;（Change has never been this fast, and it will never be this slow again）&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;私たちは今、歴史的な転換点にいます。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;顧客パネルでは、「グーテンベルクの印刷機普及に500年かかったのに対し、ChatGPTはわずか5日で100万ユーザーに到達した」という事実が対比されました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;また、SAPのMayank Shrivastava氏は、AIモデルの進化サイクルが「恐ろしいペース（frightening pace）」であるとし、以前は約10ヶ月だった更新間隔が、最新モデルではわずか7週間に短縮されていると指摘しました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;この**「不可逆的な加速」**の中で、私たちはどう振る舞うべきでしょうか？&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1238760990"&gt;「昨日」を捨て、「Learn-it-all」へ&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;この問いに対し、SAPのGlobal Head of AIであるDr. Walter Sun氏は、2つの重要な指針を示しました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. 昨日と同じ最適化をやめる&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;「昨日やってきたことを最適化するのをやめるべき（Stop optimizing what we have done yesterday）」&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;既存のプロセスをAIで単に効率化するのではなく、プロセスそのものを根本から再考し、実験（Experimentation）する好奇心が不可欠です。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. 「Know-it-all」から「Learn-it-all」へ&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;そして、マインドセットの変革として提示されたのが**「Learn-it-all」**です。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Know-it-all（全てを知る者）：&lt;/STRONG&gt; 過去の知識に固執し、自分が全てを知っていると過信する姿勢。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Learn-it-all（全てを学ぶ者）：&lt;/STRONG&gt; 毎日新しいことを学ぼうとする姿勢。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;AIは参入障壁が低く、誰でもすぐに試せます。だからこそ、知識量ではなく**「試して学ぶ（Experimentation）」サイクルを回せるかどうか**が勝負の分かれ目となります。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1042247485"&gt;技術とチームによる支援&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;もちろん、精神論だけではありません。具体的な「武器」と「事例」も共有されました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;開発者への武器：&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Muhammad Alam氏とYaad Oren氏は、7週間単位の変化に対応するため、**「クリーンなデータレイヤー（Business Data Cloud）」への投資が最重要であるとしました。また、バックログ解消のためSAP Buildのオープン化（VS Code拡張など）**が発表され、開発者が使い慣れたツールで戦える環境が約束されました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;変革はチームスポーツである：&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3日目のキーノートでは、PepsiCo（AI/Copilot活用）、HP（ERPモダナイゼーション）、Int4（テスト自動化）などの事例が共有されました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;特にJohn Deere社などによる**「Show and Tell」セッションでは、きれいなスライドだけでなく、チーム全体でどう課題を乗り越えたかという「泥臭い実践知」**が実演され、ASUGならではのリアリティある学びの場となっていました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-716651261"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-520137756"&gt;3. 分析：SAP TechEd BerlinとASUG Tech Connectの違いとは？&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;BerlinとASUG、双方に参加したJSUGメンバーの視点を総合すると、両イベントは**「同じ技術戦略（What）」&lt;STRONG&gt;を共有しながらも、&lt;/STRONG&gt;「誰に、どう伝えるか（Who &amp;amp; How）」**において明確な役割分担がなされていることがわかります。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;共通点（The "What"）&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;両イベント共に、技術的なコアメッセージは完全に一致しています。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AIエージェントの時代：&lt;/STRONG&gt; チャットボットを超えた「自律型AI（Joule Agents）」への注力。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;開発者への開放（Openness）：&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP BuildのVS Code拡張機能など、オープンな標準技術との融合。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clean Core：&lt;/STRONG&gt; イノベーションの基盤としての「クリーンなデータレイヤー」とBTPの活用。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;相違点（The "Focus"）&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;しかし、その焦点は大きく異なります。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;特徴&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP TechEd Berlin (Global)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ASUG Tech Connect (North America)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;キャッチメッセージ&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Where ideas get real.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Real Skills. Real People. Real Impact.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;主眼&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;「テクノロジーとロードマップ」&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;「プロフェッショナルの変革」&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AIの視点&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;機能と可能性（AIで何ができるか）&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;責任とスキル（人がどうAIを使いこなすか）&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;事例&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP技術のショーケース&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;泥臭い実践知の共有（Show and Tell）&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;方向性&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ベンダーからユーザーへ（Vision）&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ユーザー同士の相互扶助（Community）&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;つまり、Berlinが**「最新の武器（技術）」&lt;STRONG&gt;を渡す場であるのに対し、ASUG Tech Connectは&lt;/STRONG&gt;「使い手（人）」**を育てる場であると言えます。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-323624251"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-127110746"&gt;まとめ：同じ悩みを抱える今だからこそ、日本のコミュニティを盛り上げよう&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;「ビジネス変革は、プロフェッショナル変革なしには起こらない」&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;（Business transformation does not happen without professional transformation）&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;これは、ASUG Tech Connectのオープニング・キーノートにおいて、ASUG CEOであるGeoff Scott氏によって語られた言葉です。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;テクノロジー（AIやS/4HANA）を導入するだけではビジネスは変わらない。それを扱う我々自身が、古い習慣を捨てて新しいスキルとマインドセットを身につけること（＝プロフェッショナル変革）が、成功の絶対条件だからです。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;しかし、私たち個人には、AIによる能力拡張への希望がある一方、常に学び続ける「Learn-it-all」への変革が求められる不安もあるかと思います。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;さらに、組織に目を向ければ、データの整備、文化的な受容、セキュリティ責任など、一筋縄ではいかない壁が立ちはだかっています。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;今回の参加を通じて、私は皆様にどうしてもお伝えしたい、ある「現実」を見つけました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;会場で最新技術に触れる一方、ASUG Communityのメンバーとネットワーキングをする中で、彼らの口からこぼれたのは、意外な言葉でした。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;「既存システムの保守に忙殺されていて、新しい技術に手が回らない」&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;「変革が必要なのはわかっているが、組織がついてこない」&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;IT先進国と言われる北米の技術者でさえ、実際には私たちと全く同じ悩みを抱え、現在進行形の問題と戦っていたのです。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;「変化の速度はかつてないほど速い」というキーノートの警告は、彼らにとってもまた、重くのしかかる現実でした。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;私たちは、一人ではありません。そして、日本だけが遅れているわけでもありません。&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;世界中が同じ壁に直面している今、ASUGのCEOであるGeoff Scott氏が投げかけた問いの意味が、より一層強く響きます。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;"Why go alone when we can go together?"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;（一緒に行けるのに、なぜ一人で行くのですか？）&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;どれほど優秀な個人のスキルがあろうとも、この激流の中で孤立して戦うことのリスクはあまりに大きすぎます。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;北米のユーザーがASUGという場に集まり、お互いに支え合おうとしているように、私たちもまた、日本のコミュニティの力をもっと強くする必要があります。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ここSAP Communityはもちろん、社外の勉強会、オンラインのフォーラム、パートナーコミュニティ、そして私たちのようなユーザーグループ。日本には多様な「つながる場」があります。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;今回私たちがBerlinと北米で掴んできた知見も、様々な機会を通じて共有させていただきます。日本のコミュニティ全体をもっと盛り上げ、互いに知恵を出し合い（Collective wisdom）、この変化の波を一緒に乗り越えていきましょう。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;様々なコミュニティの場で、皆様と熱く議論できることを楽しみにしています。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--144634128"&gt;[English Version]&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Event Report: ASUG Tech Connect 2025: JSUG Technical Committee's Perspective on the SAP Ecosystem via Berlin and North America&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This article represents the personal views of the author based on their experience as an Opinion Leader of the JSUG Technical Committee and does not represent the official views of their affiliated company or organizations such as JSUG.

Meanwhile, we dispatched three members, including myself, to "ASUG Tech Connect" here in North America.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why did we dare to split the team and travel to North America?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This event was born out of a strong local will that "a place for face-to-face gathering is necessary" when SAP TechEd in North America became virtual in the past. Although SAP TechEd has now returned to in-person formats, ASUG Tech Connect has undergone its own unique evolution as an event that prioritizes "the significance of people gathering" above all else.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The latest technology (Berlin) and its practice/community (ASUG).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We report on the collaboration with SAP TechEd and the message unique to ASUG regarding "Human Transformation," which became visible precisely because we dispatched members to both sides.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--537661138"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1027577650"&gt;1. Powerful Collaboration with SAP TechEd Berlin: The "Perfect Companions" Across the Ocean&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;This year, ASUG Tech Connect was clearly defined as &lt;STRONG&gt;"The perfect companions"&lt;/STRONG&gt; to SAP TechEd. This is because, as &lt;STRONG&gt;"The Official North American SAP TechEd Tour Event,"&lt;/STRONG&gt; it is completely synchronized with the global event in the following three points:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sharing Content (Hands-on):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technical sessions and hands-on materials announced at SAP TechEd Berlin were provided as-is at the North American venue. For example, sessions on Generative AI and Fiori app development included guidance to "Try the hands-on from SAP TechEd Berlin," enabling the same technical experience as in Berlin while being in North America.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Providing Certification:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The venue offered opportunities to obtain the latest SAP certifications such as "SAP Build Developer" and "SAP Generative AI Developer" at no additional cost.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Real-time Collaboration:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the keynote, SAP's Muhammad Alam participated via live broadcast from the SAP TechEd venue in Berlin. It was emphasized that both events are transmitting a unified message, transcending physical distance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--930688148"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1420604660"&gt;2. The Core of the Keynote: Transform "People" Rather Than Technology&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The keynote, the highlight of the event, consisted of two parts: the "Opening" on the first day and the "Partner &amp;amp; Customer Stories" on the third day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What ASUG CEO Geoff Scott and SAP leaders broadcasted here was a powerful message concerning our careers and the survival of our organizations, going beyond mere introductions of new features. This is the biggest difference from SAP TechEd, which focuses on technology announcements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Change has never been this fast, and it will never be this slow again"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, I want to share a phrase that symbolizes the modern era, which was repeatedly cited throughout the event.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Change has never been this fast, and it will never be this slow again"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are now at a historical turning point.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the customer panel, a fact was contrasted: "It took 500 years for Gutenberg's printing press to spread, whereas ChatGPT reached 1 million users in just 5 days."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also, SAP's Mayank Shrivastava pointed out that the evolution cycle of AI models is at a "frightening pace," shortening from an update interval of about 10 months previously to just 7 weeks for the latest models.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this &lt;STRONG&gt;"irreversible acceleration,"&lt;/STRONG&gt; how should we behave?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Discard "Yesterday" and Move to "Learn-it-all"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In response to this question, Dr. Walter Sun, SAP's Global Head of AI, presented two important guidelines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stop Optimizing Yesterday&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Stop optimizing what we have done yesterday."&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is essential not to merely improve efficiency of existing processes with AI, but to rethink the processes themselves from the ground up and have the curiosity to experiment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;From "Know-it-all" to "Learn-it-all"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then, "Learn-it-all" was presented as the mindset transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Know-it-all:&lt;/STRONG&gt; An attitude of clinging to past knowledge and being overconfident that one knows everything.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Learn-it-all:&lt;/STRONG&gt; An attitude of trying to learn new things every day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Barriers to entry for AI are low, and anyone can try it immediately. That is why &lt;STRONG&gt;whether you can cycle through "Experimentation"&lt;/STRONG&gt; becomes the dividing line for victory, rather than the amount of knowledge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Support through Technology and Teams&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Of course, it was not just about mindset. Concrete "weapons" and "cases" were also shared.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Weapons for Developers:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Muhammad Alam and Yaad Oren stated that investment in a "Clean Data Layer (Business Data Cloud)" is paramount to respond to changes happening in 7-week units. Also, the opening of SAP Build (VS Code extensions, etc.) was announced to resolve backlogs, promising an environment where developers can fight using familiar tools.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transformation is a Team Sport:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the keynote on the third day, cases such as PepsiCo (AI/Copilot utilization), HP (ERP modernization), and Int4 (test automation) were shared.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In particular, the "Show and Tell" sessions by companies like John Deere demonstrated not just clean slides but the "gritty practical knowledge" of how the whole team overcame challenges, serving as a learning ground with reality unique to ASUG.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1323715158"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1813631670"&gt;3. Analysis: What is the Difference Between SAP TechEd Berlin and ASUG Tech Connect?&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Synthesizing the perspectives of JSUG members who participated in both Berlin and ASUG, we can see that while both events share the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Same Technology Strategy (What),"&lt;/STRONG&gt; there is a clear division of roles in &lt;STRONG&gt;"Who they tell it to and How (Who &amp;amp; How)."&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Commonalities (The "What")&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Both events are completely aligned on technical core messages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Era of AI Agents:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Focus on "Autonomous AI (Joule Agents)" beyond chatbots.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Openness to Developers:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Fusion with open standard technologies such as SAP Build VS Code extensions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clean Core:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Utilization of "Clean Data Layer" and BTP as the foundation for innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Differences (The "Focus")&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, their focus differs significantly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Feature&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP TechEd Berlin (Global)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ASUG Tech Connect (North America)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Catch Message&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Where ideas get real.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Real Skills.

It is an absolute condition for success that we, who handle it, discard old habits and acquire new skills and mindsets (= professional transformation).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, while we individuals have hope for capability expansion through AI, I think there is also anxiety about being required to transform into a constantly learning "Learn-it-all."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Furthermore, looking at organizations, we face walls that are not easily overcome, such as data preparation, cultural acceptance, and security responsibilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Through this participation, I found a certain "reality" that I desperately want to convey to you all.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While touching on the latest technology at the venue, networking with ASUG Community members revealed unexpected words from them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;"We are busy with the maintenance of existing systems and cannot get around to new technologies."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"We know transformation is necessary, but the organization doesn't follow."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even engineers in North America, which is said to be an IT-advanced region, were actually facing exactly the same worries as us and fighting ongoing problems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The keynote's warning that "Change has never been this fast" was a heavy reality for them as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;We are not alone. And it is not just Japan that is lagging behind.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now that the whole world is facing the same wall, the meaning of the question thrown by ASUG CEO Geoff Scott resonates even more strongly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Why go alone when we can go together?"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;No matter how excellent individual skills are, the risk of fighting in isolation in this torrent is too great.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Just as users in North America are gathering at ASUG to support each other, we also need to strengthen the power of the Japanese community more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are diverse "places to connect" in Japan: not just the SAP Community here, but also external study groups, online forums, partner communities, and user groups like ours.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We will share the insights we grabbed in Berlin and North America through various opportunities. Let's energize the entire Japanese community, share wisdom with each other (Collective wisdom), and ride over this wave of change together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I look forward to heating up the discussion with you all at various community venues.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am currently working with SAP Business One and need to determine whether the existing User-Defined Objects (UDO), User-Defined Fields (UDF), and User-Defined Tables (UDT) in the system were created using the SDK (DI API) or through the UI interface (Tools &amp;gt; Customization Tools).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Does anyone with experience in this area have a sample query or a specific method/check to distinguish between objects created directly in B1's UI and those created programmatically via the SDK?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any shared knowledge or sample SQL queries would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you all very much!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My client has set up the TFA in IAS for their existing employees' access to SuccessFactors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I would like to check if it is possible to do the same for Onboardees? I have checked and only able to find this KBA&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0002776016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://me.sap.com/notes/0002776016&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;about TFA and would like to know if this is the correct guide?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It seems like once TFA is enabled for the SuccessFactors application in IAS, it should be applied to Onboardees as well as I do not see a separate settings for Onboarding module?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1767296394"&gt;Introduction: Why IDoc-based Eventing matters&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Event-driven architectures have become a cornerstone for building responsive, loosely coupled SAP landscapes. With SAP Event Mesh and SAP Advanced Event Mesh (AEM), organizations can now distribute business events in near real time across SAP and non-SAP systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, despite the growing availability of native business events in SAP S/4HANA, &lt;STRONG&gt;IDocs remain one of the most widely used integration mechanisms&lt;/STRONG&gt; in productive SAP landscapes today. Especially in hybrid and transition scenarios — such as ECC to S/4HANA conversions, RISE with SAP journeys, or coexistence setups.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This leads to a pragmatic but important question for many architects and integration teams:&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;How can we enable event-driven integration when IDocs are the primary source of truth?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570782889"&gt;Motivation: Bridging Legacy Integration with Modern Eventing&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many customers want to adopt event-driven integration patterns &lt;STRONG&gt;without breaking existing interfaces&lt;/STRONG&gt; or redesigning core business processes. Replacing IDocs with native domain events is often not feasible in the short term due to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Large numbers of productive IDoc interfaces&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business-critical dependencies on established ALE/EDI processes&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Limited capacity to redesign integration contracts during S/4HANA or RISE projects&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the same time, downstream consumers increasingly expect &lt;STRONG&gt;event-based communication&lt;/STRONG&gt;, lightweight payloads, and scalable publish/subscribe models instead of point-to-point messaging.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1374269384"&gt;What This Blog Covers&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we will compare &lt;STRONG&gt;four technical approaches&lt;/STRONG&gt; for enabling SAP Eventing with IDocs as a source:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP RAP&lt;/STRONG&gt; – modeling domain-oriented events in the backend&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Application Interface Framework (AIF)&lt;/STRONG&gt; – governed IDoc processing and transformation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ASAPIO Event Add-on&lt;/STRONG&gt; – purpose-built IDoc-to-event enablement&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Suite (PI-style Cloud Integration) to SAP AEM&lt;/STRONG&gt; – middleware-driven event publication&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The comparison focuses on &lt;STRONG&gt;technical, operational, and commercial KPIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, helping architects and integration leads decide which approach best fits their current landscape — and their long-term eventing strategy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Furthermore we are planning to release a setup blog for every approach in 2026.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="1664"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="168"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;KPI Area&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="267"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sub-KPI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="445"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP RAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="204"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP AIF&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="219"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ASAPIO Event Add-on&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="361"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IDoc with Integration Suite, Process Integration &amp;nbsp;→ SAP AEM&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="168"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="267"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Architecture fit for eventing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="445"&gt;RAP is a development model for OData/REST apps; events must be explicitly modeled and outbound connectors added.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="204"&gt;AIF is built to process, validate and route message-based interfaces, including IDocs, before forwarding.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="219"&gt;Purpose-built for IDoc capture → event broker integration; minimal coding needed.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="361"&gt;Uses IDoc adapters in Integration Suite (Cloud Integration) to pick up IDocs → transform → push to AEM; classic PI-style patterns.

While purpose-built add-ons and middleware enable fast time-to-value, backend-driven approaches provide stronger long-term alignment with domain-driven and native event models. Ultimately, the right choice depends on whether your priority is &lt;STRONG&gt;speed, governance, or future-proof event semantics&lt;/STRONG&gt; on your journey toward an event-driven SAP architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Stay tuned and Happy Eventing&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi All, I am working on the customer expected price condition type EDI1. I have created a sales order and it has normal price with PPR0 condition type. I have entered the customer expected price condition type EDI1 manually and entered some price less than the price of PPR0. system showed incomplete document due to price difference, when I save the sales order.&amp;nbsp; After this I went to Fiori app &lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Sales documents with Customer expected price&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt; and in the sales order I have clicked on Accept customer price button as shown in the below screen shot and observed that system is not replacing the actual price with expected customer price. am I missing some settings or is this standard behavior. Do we need to change the price manually.? Please guide.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="KVKUMAR_0-1765770865622.png" style="width: 890px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351881iDA7F2D0D76B5890E/image-dimensions/890x69?v=v2" width="890" height="69" role="button" title="KVKUMAR_0-1765770865622.png" alt="KVKUMAR_0-1765770865622.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kumar&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please suggest if it is possible to add a custom verification logic for one of the fields on RF(example : product - decode product number from a suppliers barcode - barcode consists of other fields as well, not just product).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Shashi&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Krithik,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I'd like to ask you a question.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When using this filter, filtering for values that are equal to a certain value works fine. Is it possible to add a filter for "not equal to" conditions? For example, the material type is not equal to ROH. Thanks&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Great work here... I know there is also a Fiori Elements building block for the Rich Text Editor. I'm wondering if it's also possible to do this image extension with that component?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2179576"&gt;@Ali_Mohamed26&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;,&lt;BR /&gt;The reason for Profit Center is Blank in FBL1N / FBL5N because of Underlying Table, FBL1N (Vendor Line Item Display) and FBL5N (Customer Line Item Display) are based on BSEG (entry view).&lt;BR /&gt;In BSEG, the Profit Center (PRCTR) is not stored on vendor/customer line items because those are subledger postings. Also Profit Center Derivation, Profit Center is derived during document splitting and stored in the general ledger view (tables like FAGLFLEXA/FAGLFLEXT in new GL).&lt;BR /&gt;That’s why when you switch to the G/L view, you see the Profit Center correctly populated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you need Profit Center reporting at vendor/customer line-item level, you have a few options as mentioned below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use FAGLL03 (G/L Line-Item Display)&lt;BR /&gt;This report is based on the G/L view and shows Profit Center directly. You can filter by reconciliation accounts to see vendor/customer-related postings with Profit Center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Custom Report / Enhancement&lt;BR /&gt;Some companies enhance FBL1N/FBL5N with a user exit (e.g., RFPOSXEXTEND) to pull Profit Center from the G/L view and display it. This requires ABAP development but is a common solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use Document Splitting Reports&lt;BR /&gt;Reports like FAGLL03 or line item reports in new GL are designed to show dimensions like Profit Center, Segment, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reconciliation via Tables&lt;BR /&gt;Join BSEG (entry view) with FAGLFLEXA (GL view) using document number, company code, fiscal year. This way you can build a custom query/report to show vendor/customer line items with Profit Center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope you got clarity, if you have any more question feel free to ask&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2053253"&gt;@nag_7589&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;,&lt;BR /&gt;The transaction code MRN9 shows current live values, not historical stock. To get inventory as of a past date (like Nov 30), you need to use stock reports with historical key dates such as MB5B (Stock on Posting Date). The transaction code MRN9 is primarily for inventory valuation and reconciliation with G/L accounts. Even if you enter a past key date, it often shows current balances because it doesn’t freeze stock snapshots. This mismatch is common when MM periods aren’t closed or when auditors request a cutoff date&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;MB5B – Stock on Posting Date, Shows stock balances as of a chosen posting date. Widely used for audit purposes. You can select materials, plants, storage locations, and enter Nov 30, 2025 as the cutoff.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;MC.9 / MCBE – Stock Analysis, These are LIS (Logistics Information System) reports. They allow you to analyze historical stock levels by period. MCBE lets you select materials and periods, giving a snapshot of stock as of that date&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope you got clarity from my response&lt;/P&gt;</content>

VARIABLEMEMBER #PYTotal of [d/date]

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1636610474"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;When I first started working on UI(user interface) development, accessibility sounded like one of those mysterious requirements that walked the thin line between “nice to have” and “an absolute waste of time and effort”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Screen readers? ARIA(Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels? Keyboard navigation and high contrast themes?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I had no idea what any of this meant – and honestly, I didn’t think I needed to. Who even used these things?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But the deeper I got into SAP Fiori/ UI5, the faster I realized something very important: Accessibility isn’t about extra work. It’s about building applications people can use, especially when you want your product to be used by a very wide audience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP invests heavily in making its design systems accessible out of the box. The moment we start doing custom freestyle UI5 development, we, as developers, are responsible for keeping this quality intact.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog is meant to be a beginner friendly guide for anyone and everyone who wants to understand:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What accessibility really is&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Why it matters&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Common pitfalls in UI5 apps&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to start building accessible features without feeling overwhelmed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whether you are new developer, or a veteran interested in getting into the world of accessibility, this guide is for you!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1440096969"&gt;What is accessibility and why should you care?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s clarify some of the basic misconceptions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1372666183"&gt;Accessibility != Only screen readers&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most beginners think accessibility means that it is a support system for blind users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agreed, screen readers are a major part, but accessibility also includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Low vision users&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Colour blind users&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Users with motor disabilities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Users with dyslexia or cognitive challenges&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Users who rely only on keyboard navigation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Users working in bright, sunlit environments&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;rs on small screens or touch devices&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Basically, accessibility isn’t just about disabilities, it’s about &lt;STRONG&gt;real-world usage&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1176152678"&gt;Business and legal requirements&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Depending on your region, accessibility compliance may be required by law (WCAG, EN 301 549, ADA, etc.).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP itself follows these standards as part of its UX(user experience) strategy. But even if your project isn’t legally mandated:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accessible apps reach more users, reduce support tickets, and improve perceived quality.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-979639173"&gt;SAP’s philosophy: Accessible by default&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;UI5 controls come with built-in:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ARIA attributes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Keyboard navigation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Focus handling&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Theming and contrast handling&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;BUT, the moment we override them with:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Custom CSS&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Custom HTML&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Custom JS(Java Script) focus logic&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Non-standard layouts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;…we break accessibility without even noticing it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-654042949"&gt;Most Common Accessibility Issues (and How to Fix Them)&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even if you use SAP UI5 controls correctly, there are a few pitfalls that most beginners hit. I definitely learnt things the hard way. Let’s run through them one by one and see why it happens, why it matters and how do you fix it in UI5.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-586612163"&gt;Colour, Contrast and Theming&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why contrast matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Low vision users (and those on bright screens) depend heavily on contrast. If your text blends into your background, even slightly, a huge portion of users can’t read it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP follows WCAG(Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) contrast standards by default. However, accessibility issues often arise when &lt;STRONG&gt;custom CSS&lt;/STRONG&gt; is introduced.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Custom CSS overrides the themes default colours. This means that the moment a user switches from, let’s say, SAP Morning Horizon to SAP Evening Horizon, or some High Contrast theme, your nice looking custom blue, grey, or white will instantly break contrast rules.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Fix -&amp;gt; Use SAP Named Colours&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP UI5 provides semantic colour variables that automatically adapt to themes. Let’s look at the correct way to incorporate this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Wrong Way:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.cusCountSizeNewFeature {
    color: #2424fc !important;  /* this is a nice looking blue in light mode */
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Correct way:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.cusCountSizeNewFeature {
    color: var(--sapInformativeColor) !important; /* adapts across themes */
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why this is powerful?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Theme switching becomes seamless&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;WCAG contrast ratios are preserved&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You stay aligned with the Fiori design ecosystem&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-390098658"&gt;Responsiveness&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is not just a design or a layout problem. It can affect anybody and everybody because many users:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Zoom their screens&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use large fonts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Work on mobile&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use split screen mode&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use tablet input or touch screens&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If your UI doesn’t adapt, your users could lose access to content.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Common Responsiveness Issues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Text Truncation&lt;BR /&gt;Short labels become unreadable. For example, “Transaction” could become “Transa…” or “Customer Name” could be “Custo…”&lt;BR /&gt;If the Truncated text contains meaning, it becomes inaccessible.&lt;BR /&gt;Fix:&lt;BR /&gt;Avoid truncation as much as possible.&lt;BR /&gt;Use a tooltip on truncated text&lt;BR /&gt;Prefer responsive UI5 controls over fixed widths&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Overflow Text&lt;BR /&gt;Long values break layouts or overlap with other elements. The fix is simple. Wherever possible, use the wrapping property. For example:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Text text="{path: 'desc'}" wrapping="true"/&amp;gt;​&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Unresponsive Font Sizes&lt;BR /&gt;Some developers like to set pixel-based font sizes. This breaks zooming and accessibility. The fix for this is to use rem or theme variables.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Touch responsiveness&lt;BR /&gt;If buttons or icons are too small, they become impossible to tap. SAP recommends a 44px minimum tap target. Avoid placing tiny icons close to each other without padding. UI5 automatically handles this of you use Fiori controls instead of custom HTML.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-193585153"&gt;Alternate texts, Tooltips and Descriptive Labels&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Images, buttons and icons must describe what they are or do, especially for screen reader users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Alt texts for images&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Image src="cat/logo.png" alt="A cute cat"/&amp;gt;​&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If the image is only decorative&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Image src="kitty/divider.png" decorative="true"/&amp;gt;​&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If this property is set to true, the alt text is ignored.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accessible names for Buttons&lt;BR /&gt;If we declare a button as given below&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Button icon="sap-icon://delete"/&amp;gt;​&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This will fail accessibility, since the screen reader reads it as “Button”. To ensure correctness, we define the text and tooltips.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Button icon="sap-icon://delete" text="Delete" tooltip="Delete item"/&amp;gt;​&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tooltips for truncated text&lt;BR /&gt;In case we have long texts, or we are truncating text intentionally, add tooltips.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Text text="{Name}" maxLines="1" tooltip="{Name}" /&amp;gt;​&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use ARIA helpers&lt;BR /&gt;For custom layouts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Input ariaLabelledBy="labelId"/&amp;gt;​&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--2928352"&gt;Navigation, Scrolling and Table Design&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keyboard navigation for any UI is a must. A fully accessible app must be usable with:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tab&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Shift + tab&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enter&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Space&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Arrow Keys&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Users with motor disabilities rely heavily on this. If you build custom elements without roles or focus handling, this will break.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Keyboard traps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sometimes, users can get stuck in a nested scrolling trap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Page -&amp;gt; Panel -&amp;gt; ScrollContainer -&amp;gt; Table&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here, the user tabs into a ScrollContainer and gets stuck. This is why we should avoid unnecessary scroll containers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Horizontal Scrolling &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Horizontal Scrolling is an accessibility nightmare. It forces users to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Drag horizontally&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Loses track of headers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Miss important fields&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Struggle with screen readers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a problem most seen in tables with large column counts. To solve this issue, one of many steps can be taken. You can use:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;sap.m.Table – responsive&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;sap.m.Column – provides pop ins which are responsive. You can control what columns to be shown on smaller screen sizes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Setting the growing property to true – this ensures the user isn’t overwhelmed with too much information&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Table design – Best practices&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Always provide meaningful column headers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Avoid short forms in headers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Avoid multilevel frozen columns&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;DO NOT force horizontal scroll unless absolutely necessary&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Prefer using Lists or Grid Lists for card like layouts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use meaningful “no data” text.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-441215507"&gt;Tools to Test Accessibility&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Like how cleanliness starts at home, testing should start on your local system. Doing this a few times automatically makes you mindful of the potential problems you can face before you even begin your development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--48701005"&gt;Keyboard Navigation&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before you use any fancy tool for testing, do this: Put your mouse away and try to navigate your app using only the keyboard.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While you do this, here are some questions you should ask:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Can I reach every interactive element?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Does the focus shift logically?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Can I open and close dialogs without touching the mouse?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do I get stuck in any keyboard traps?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is focus visible at all times?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can try this exercise with various screen resolutions and zoom levels&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Fiori has its own keyboard shortcuts for tables, lists and other controls. Make sure your app doesn’t break them. A list of all available shortcuts can be found here: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/468a97775123488ab3345a0c48cadd8f/0cd318c83ec5473d9a091c1782d03c21.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Link&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--245214510"&gt;Contrast Checkers&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;Even if you use SAP Names colours, it is better to test for contrast manually, especially if you introduce any custom styles. I personally use the Colour Contrast Analyser&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Things to check&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Text vs background&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Icons vs background&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Focus borders&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Disabled states&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Theming (light/dark/high contrast)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If these are readable across various themes, you are good to go!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--441728015"&gt;Screen Readers&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;You don’t need to be a screen reader expert. Just know how to turn one on and check the basic flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a windows user, my go to screen reader is JAWS. It is known for its high accuracy and is very common in corporate accessibility audits. If your app works with JAWS, it means that you are on the right track.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are Mac user, you can use VoiceOver. This is a built-in screen reader for macs and is good for quick tests.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What to test?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are form labels read correctly?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are buttons announced with purpose (“Delete item”, not “Button”)?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are images read with correct alt text?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Does the screen reader announce when a dialog opens?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Can you navigate tables row by row?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If any of these are failing, or if the announcements are confusing or not in order, then your UI needs improvement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--638241520"&gt;Browser Accessibility Inspection Tools&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since most Fiori applications recommend Chrome to be used as the preferred browser, let’s look at what it has.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Chrome DevTools&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The accessibility tab in chrome is super useful for developers. In this tab, you can inspect:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accessible name&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Role&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ARIA attributes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;States&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Contrast issues&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Keyboard behaviour&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Responsiveness is different screen sizes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lighthouse Accessibility Audit &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Lighthouse accessibility is&amp;nbsp;an automated tool by Google that checks a web page against a set of rules to provide an accessibility score and a report on potential issues. You can add the extension to your browser. Once it is added, click on the Lighthouse icon and select “Generate Report”. Some of the things it checks are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Contrast issues&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tap target sizes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Missing labels&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ARIA role issues&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;HTML semantics&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Broken keyboard tap order&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Lighthouse is a great starting point, but definitely not a substitute for manual testing. An accessibility score of 90+ is a good score.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From whatever we have seen till now, accessibility might sound complicated, but once you start practicing it, you realize it’s mostly just… common sense.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use proper UI5 controls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Don’t fight the theme with custom CSS to make your app jazzy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Make sure colours actually contrast.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Label things like how you would label the boxes on your kitchen shelf. This helps anyone who is looking (even screen readers) know what things are.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And for the love of UX, check if your app works without a mouse.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That’s it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If your UI works in light mode, dark more, with a keyboard, and with a screen reader announcing things correctly, you’re already miles ahead.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So as the “Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy” would say – DON’T PANIC.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go have fun and build cool stuff.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Make it usable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Make it friendly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Happy testing, and finally, welcome to the accessibility club &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766613119"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;You subscribed SAP cloud services, and eventually operate systems, to fulfil the business needs of your company. This service &amp;amp; system landscape is processing every day vast amounts of transactions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even so, in general everything works smoothly in your landscape, you must detect promptly any unexpected behavior and evaluate its potential impact without delay.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Such problems are usually producing exception data in logs. You can of course review those various logs, using local monitoring tools provided by the respective solutions. But this approach turns out to be fastidious, as you need to use different tools, day-in and day-out. And you will end up analyzing thousands of logs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My blog series will guide you through the capabilities offered by SAP Cloud ALM Exception Monitoring, unveiling also upcoming evolutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;BR /&gt;SAP Cloud ALM is available free of charge under fair usage, for customers having cloud subscriptions with SAP Enterprise Support. &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/setup-administration/provisioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Get you own tenant in less than 1 hour.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570099614"&gt;One place to review all collected exceptions&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using SAP Cloud ALM Exception Monitoring, you get a comprehensive overview of the exceptions occurring across your landscape. It also offers a wide range of downstream actions, like a built-in alerting mechanism, and a central e-mail notification. Furthermore, you can integrate your ticketing system, or execute maintained operation flows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Exception Monitoring features are articulated into pages, as follow:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Exceptions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Here you start your analysis, using an overview of the total number of exceptions that occurred in a time interval, across all supported products and log categories.&lt;BR /&gt;You will then drill down to the actual exceptions for the log category you would like to analyze first.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tracking&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With this tool you swiftly find back all exceptions that match any provided keyword. The entered keywords can be technical identifiers, like a W3C trace ID, or any value from the exception payloads.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Alerting&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In case you activated the built-in alerting, you can review and process in this page, all alerts that were created, based on the rules that you defined for the Exception Logs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Exception Pattern Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Planned)&lt;BR /&gt;Using AI generated indicators you will…&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Stay tuned for my next blog posts, unveiling the details.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1502668828"&gt;Exceptions (Page)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This page provides an overview of the number of exceptions, across your landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using the page header, you will quickly identify exception bursts, impacting the monitored products.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Accordingly, the page content displays one card per monitored service and system, clustered per product. You additionally benefit from a summary card, in case you monitor several services or system, belonging to the same product.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The cards display a list of exception categories. A category could be considered as a log-type, like System logs, Java Application logs, etc. Per category you see an exception count and a trend. The trend is reflecting the evolution of the number of exceptions, comparing the amount for the current time interval selection, with the previous interval.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For instance, if your time selection is last 2 days (Thursday to Friday), the trend will display: increasing, if the number of exceptions for this category was lower the 2 days before (Tuesday to Wednesday). Taking a second example, if your time selection is CW 45, the trend will display: decreasing, if the number of exceptions was lower on CW 44.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Number of Exceptions overview.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350921iE4D93C2CE14C31AB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Number of Exceptions overview.png" alt="Number of Exceptions overview.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By clicking on the entry “ABAP Application Log” from the card “All SAP S/4HANA”, you will drill down into the following screen. There you can centrally review all SLG1 error logs from the S/4HANA private cloud services that you added into your application shell scope-selector.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;BR /&gt;Exception Monitoring is displaying exception logs only for the categories where you enabled the data collection, during the configuration process (see next section). In case you don’t see some error logs you are expecting, keep in mind to review the configuration, as the collection might be restricted to only retrieve a log data subset of the monitored service or system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="New ExMon UI.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350923i9ED1CE1D9574F862/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="New ExMon UI.png" alt="New ExMon UI.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As shown below, using the powerful multilevel filter capabilities, you can stepwise narrow-down the number of exceptions to be analyzed, concentrating on specific flaws.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="New ExMon UI - Filter capabilities.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350924i635FB9E2A447B3AD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="New ExMon UI - Filter capabilities.png" alt="New ExMon UI - Filter capabilities.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Exception Monitoring is designed to reflect errors and warnings, as provided by the supported log sources.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, do not expect to see all types of log entries, including the ones with a log level info or debug! However, Exception Monitoring offers a very convenient “&lt;EM&gt;Resolved&lt;/EM&gt;” status, for log sources that provide context-sensitive logs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For instance, let’s take the category &lt;EM&gt;Artifact Integration Content&lt;/EM&gt; as an example. Exception Monitoring will report all newly occurring Artifact deployment errors. Whenever such an erroneous Artifact is later-on undeployed or fixed, the status of the previously reported exception is updated to “&lt;EM&gt;Resolved&lt;/EM&gt;”. You therefore understand that this past issue is no longer actual, and you may skip its analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1306155323"&gt;Tracking (Page)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This efficient search tool will assist you in most circumstances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine you are currently analyzing an exception. Now, you would like to cross check whether this issue has further related errors, or if it is the consequence of some integration calls. In case you see a tab “Association Context” for the analyzed exception, open it and take one of the provided correlators, like the transaction ID or the W3C trace ID. Use this Identifier in the tracking tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Otherwise, imagine an end-user is reporting a technical error message that he encountered in one of the services you are monitoring. Using the Tracking page, you can look up the mentioned error message, for the services and systems you have in your scope selection or your home page favorites.&lt;BR /&gt;Note:&lt;BR /&gt;Exception Monitoring is in general collecting backend exceptions. Frontend errors, occurring at UI level, are usually not in scope.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, imagine that you don’t remember when and where a given error occurred the last time. Simply open the tracking page and lookup any information you know about the error. The tool will report all occurrences.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-980559099"&gt;How to setup Exception Monitoring?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-913128313"&gt;Connectivity&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Cloud ALM for Operations requires, as a central platform, to access the data you want to monitor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I recommend you to follow the &lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;expert poral documentation&lt;/A&gt;, which describes how to enable the integration, product per product.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Be aware that the integrations are of different kinds:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;[SAP managed]&lt;BR /&gt;Most products are now natively integrated with SAP Cloud ALM and therefore do not require any preparation work.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;[Customer built]&lt;BR /&gt;Open Telemetry based integrations are possible, as documented in the expert portal. You should carefully follow the instructions to enable this type of integration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;[S/4HANA public cloud &amp;amp; SAP BTP ABAP environment]&lt;BR /&gt;Currently you still need to explicitly setup a push-base data collection, using a communication arrangement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;[S/4HANA private cloud]&lt;BR /&gt;As described in the expert portal, run the mentioned ABAP transaction to enable the integration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;[Pull-based]&lt;BR /&gt;Finally a few other products, still rely on pull-based data collections. Here, you need to declare within SAP Cloud ALM the endpoints to connect to the monitored services or systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-716614808"&gt;Data collection activation&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, once you fulfilled all preparation work, you need to explicitly turn on the data collection for the relevant systems and cloud services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Exception Monitoring data is clustered into product specific log sources, designated as categories. You can turn on the data collection globally at system or cloud service level, or selectively at category level.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keep in mind that some categories (log sources) could be very verbose, producing a lot of exception data. For such categories, eventually consider fine-tuning the data collection, by specifying which data subsets you want to monitor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-520101303"&gt;Enable downstream actions (Alerting, E-mail notifications, etc.)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;By setting up IEP event actions, you can typically generate alerts or get e-mail notifications for the collected exceptions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Be aware that the configuration UI currently doesn’t offer the possibility to define filters. This means, in case you enable such actions, you will get a significant stream of alerts or e-mails, as long as your system or services produces exceptions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-323587798"&gt;Future evolution&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most configuration screens were designed in the early times of SAP Cloud ALM, as a bootstrap solution. A redesign is currently ongoing to streamline the configuration screens and offer long awaited features, like advanced filtering capabilities at data collection and event creation level.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Stay tuned for my next blog posts, unveiling the details.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--2008426"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the advent of cloud solutions an increasing amount of software operation related tasks are delegated. Take this as an opportunity to increase your attention, monitoring tightly the business value chain of the integrated solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, consider that Exception Monitoring will remain an essential activity, evolving from infrastructure-centric alerts to a business-value-centric observability.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hi RAP Developers, Good Day&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the SAP RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming Model), enhancing UI behavior dynamically is a common requirement, especially when business rules demand that certain fields be shown or hidden based on the underlying data. While RAP provides powerful mechanisms for extending behavior, one of the most flexible techniques for achieving dynamic UI control is through &lt;STRONG&gt;virtual elements&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution Overview:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Virtual elements allow developers to calculate values at runtime without physically storing them in the database. Beyond computed fields, they can also serve as &lt;EM&gt;UI control flags,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;for example, determining whether a field should be visible, editable, or hidden in the Fiori Elements UI. In this blog, we explore how to leverage virtual elements to dynamically show or hide UI fields based on data conditions. Using a simple ABAP class implementation, we demonstrate how a virtual field can drive UI visibility logic efficiently within RAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Projection View:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ObjectModel.virtualElementCalculatedBy: 'ABAP:ZCL_HIDE_VIRT'

This approach provides a clean separation between data and UI logic, improves performance, and keeps the design fully extensible. With a simple calculation exit, fields like &lt;EM&gt;Hide Indicator&lt;/EM&gt; can be determined at runtime based on business rules, allowing the UI to react instantly and display only what is relevant to the user. This method ensures a smarter, more flexible, and more maintainable RAP application.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Thanks For Reading My Blog..&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/ABAP+Connectivity/pd-p/266264953119842772207986043063520" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="313-1"&gt;ABAP Connectivity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+BTP+ABAP+environment/pd-p/73555000100800001164" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="11-1"&gt;SAP BTP ABAP environment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766649420"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Process Visibility Challenges&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most organizations struggle to clearly answer questions about how their business processes run. Questions such as how long it takes to process a customer order or why invoices are delayed often lead to manual investigations. Teams review emails, interview stakeholders, and build spreadsheets, only to discover fragmented and inconsistent process execution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This lack of visibility makes it difficult to identify bottlenecks, understand delays, and prioritize improvements. Without reliable data, decisions are often based on assumptions rather than facts. SAP Signavio Process Insights is designed to address this challenge by providing data-driven visibility into how processes execute across enterprise systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Signavio Process Insights (&lt;A href="https://www.signavio.com/products/process-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.signavio.com/products/process-insights/&lt;/A&gt;) is a cloud-based solution that provides data-driven insights into business processes, identifying inefficiencies and offering recommendations for improvement​. SAP Build Process Automation enables users to automate business processes with low-code/no-code tools, integrating workflows, RPA, and AI for enhanced efficiency. It simplifies automation design and deployment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570135915"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supported Source Systems Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Signavio Process Insights can connect to one or multiple source systems to analyze business processes. Supported systems include CRM, ECC, Ariba, S/4HANA, EWM, SRM, and TM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are two ways to connect SAP Signavio Process Insights with your on-premise system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Direct&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When source system meets all the prerequisites&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Can be upgraded anytime in case new features come with new or updated prerequisites&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You do not plan on connecting multiple source systems&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Through intermediate system&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When source system does not meet the requirements&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cannot be planned for maintenance activity as needed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You do intend to connect multiple source systems&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The focus of this blog is on connecting an on-premise S/4HANA system directly to SAP Signavio Process Insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373622410"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites To Start The Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before starting the integration from the backend system to SAP Signavio Process Insights, a dedicated SAP BTP subaccount must be created. The detailed steps for preparing the subaccount are documented in &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/signavio-process-insights/administration-guide/preparing-account-for-sap-signavio-process-insights" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, the supported versions of the ST-PI and ST-A/PI plug-ins must be installed in the on-premise S/4HANA system. The required versions and SAP Notes depend on the system release and can be found &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/signavio-process-insights/administration-guide/installing-st-pi-and-st-api-plug-ins-direct-connection" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1177108905"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Update ST-PI plug-in?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Signavio Process Insights&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;uses the ST-PI plug-in to connect your SAP on-premise source system to your cloud tenant.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The ST-PI plug-in requires an encrypted HTTPS outbound connection to SAP BTP to be set up. Using the plug-in and the HTTPS connection allows you to trigger the data transfer yourself from your SAP on-premise system. This means that the&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Connector is not needed&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;and cannot be used to connect your system to your&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Signavio Process Insights&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;application running on&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP BTP&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The ST-PI plug-in includes functionality from&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Cloud ALM&lt;/SPAN&gt;. Other functionalities of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Cloud ALM&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;solution are not used, only the ST-PI plug-in in your system is leveraged. Data from your SAP on-premise system is sent directly to&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Signavio Process Insights&lt;/SPAN&gt;, it's not stored in&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Cloud ALM&lt;/SPAN&gt;. You do not need to use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Abhishek_Soni_0-1765697801792.png" style="width: 527px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351753iD1B76208DAE4674E/image-dimensions/527x354?v=v2" width="527" height="354" role="button" title="Abhishek_Soni_0-1765697801792.png" alt="Abhishek_Soni_0-1765697801792.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-980595400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Required Users and Roles&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Abhishek_Soni_1-1765697838880.png" style="width: 528px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351754i6674ED31B03F9FB2/image-dimensions/528x251?v=v2" width="528" height="251" role="button" title="Abhishek_Soni_1-1765697838880.png" alt="Abhishek_Soni_1-1765697838880.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have installed an ST-PI version that is no longer supported and are using a direct system connection, you would need to assign the following roles for the Background user:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP_MANAGED_BPOANA_ALL&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP_SDF_ALM_METRIC_PUSH_FND&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Business ALL profile which includes the Authorization object&amp;nbsp;M_MTDI_ORG.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;NOTE:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;If the PFCG role&amp;nbsp;SAP_SDF_ALM_METRIC_PUSH_FND does not exist, implement SAP NOTE &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3372078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3372078&lt;/A&gt; in the system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Once all the pre-requisites are met, the connection setup can begin. The steps are as follows:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Depending on the installed ST-PI version, the setup is performed using one of the following transactions:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Tcode: /n/SDF/PIN_SETUP or /n/SDF/ALM_SETUP&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Provide Target ALM Destination. You can choose an existing connection or create a new one.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Abhishek_Soni_0-1765699307871.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351769iEB647E5358DD7D22/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Abhishek_Soni_0-1765699307871.png" alt="Abhishek_Soni_0-1765699307871.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Copy the service key from the Signavio service instance, under Credentials column in SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Abhishek_Soni_1-1765699307876.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351770iBA787FE2BD2B3EE3/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Abhishek_Soni_1-1765699307876.png" alt="Abhishek_Soni_1-1765699307876.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Abhishek_Soni_2-1765699307885.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351771iF4BBB80B135BD384/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Abhishek_Soni_2-1765699307885.png" alt="Abhishek_Soni_2-1765699307885.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;-&amp;nbsp;Copy the URL (Line 23) from the service key credentials to paste in the Root URL field (Step 5).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Abhishek_Soni_3-1765699307892.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351773i44B93B207ACE5DC3/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Abhishek_Soni_3-1765699307892.png" alt="Abhishek_Soni_3-1765699307892.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Click on “Create/Update Destination” button in your source system.

A common issue is missing proxy server or port information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Both the SM59 destination and the ALM setup configuration should be reviewed to ensure that data can flow from S/4HANA to SAP Signavio Process Insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the connection is established, data availability can be verified in the Signavio tenant by checking the Administration section.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Abhishek_Soni_8-1765699307923.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351777i9C55CCD787F74883/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Abhishek_Soni_8-1765699307923.png" alt="Abhishek_Soni_8-1765699307923.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog explains how SAP Signavio Process Insights integrates with an on-premise S/4HANA system using a direct connection approach. It is intended to provide clarity on prerequisites, architecture, and the overall setup flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For detailed configuration steps and troubleshooting, the official SAP documentation should be used as the primary reference.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please refer to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/BPI/f5642e5272c1465986661c763b56213d/bfda0682adc0477984933ea975a4c2d1.html#required-preconfiguration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/BPI/f5642e5272c1465986661c763b56213d/bfda0682adc0477984933ea975a4c2d1.html#required-preconfiguration&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PBdtAgTsl8&amp;amp;t=230s__;!!ETWHofP4MC0!7H_gnqgAWglGe3-gspZ_x-d9VTIYMUwr4XkR1iPlKOoTqW5GLjvXdyd74Lj2yfzwSrDK6B67uuyE1imM5W0$" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PBdtAgTsl8&amp;amp;t=230s&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(Icon Tab Bar + Live Search Filtering)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1733368283"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAPUI5 applications, users often need to filter data quickly based on different parameters—such as status, category, or keyword. While using only one filter works in simple cases, real applications require combining filters to offer a better user experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I will explain &lt;STRONG&gt;how to implement dual filtering&lt;/STRONG&gt; using:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Icon Tab Bar&lt;/STRONG&gt; – to filter by status&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Live Search Field&lt;/STRONG&gt; – to filter inside already filtered data&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Combining both filters&lt;/STRONG&gt; so only the relevant records are shown&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this approach, users can first select a category (like COMPLETE or PENDING) and then type a search term to refine the results further.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Team,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I was following the learning course&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/courses/implementing-sap-service-and-asset-manager/performing-basic-extensions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://learning.sap.com/courses/implementing-sap-service-and-asset-manager/performing-basic-extensions&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;to build the extension to standard SAP Service and Asset Manager.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have question about the version control managed in SAP Business Application Studio.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Working in SAP Business Application Studio (BAS) with two MDK projects:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAPAssetManager – Standard SAP baseline metadata (managed in Git)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;ZSAPAssetManager – Extension project used for customer-specific enhancements (not yet managed in Git)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Currently, I have modified Overview.page&amp;nbsp; from the standard SAPAssetManager and placed the modified version under the Pages folder of ZSAPAssetManager, and then deployed it to Mobile Services. This is working fine as expected.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If, in the future, I need to enhance Overview.page again (same file, same page), how does BAS/MDK know whether to use the old modified or newly modified Overview.page file from ZSAPAssetManager for deployment?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;thanks&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3305"&gt;@Jitendra_Kansal78&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;@&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/242109" target="_self"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Arunachalam&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Everyone!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recently, I worked on a timestamp conversion issue related to &lt;STRONG&gt;user-specific time zones&lt;/STRONG&gt; in SAP. The data stored in the SAP level was correct, but when displayed through an ABAP report, the timestamp appeared incorrect for some users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After analyzing the issue, I found that the root cause was the &lt;STRONG&gt;conversion routine defined in the domain&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This routine automatically converts timestamps based on the user's logon time zone, which caused mismatches during display.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I will show how to resolve this issue by converting all timestamps to &lt;STRONG&gt;UTC&lt;/STRONG&gt; before displaying them, ensuring consistent results for every user—regardless of their time zone or domain settings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766560230"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Problem Summary&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;The timestamp stored in the database table (&lt;CODE&gt;ZDEL_INFO&lt;/CODE&gt;) was correct.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;But when displaying the data in a report, the timestamp appeared incorrect for some users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;This happened because the domain of the timestamp field had a conversion routine (e.g., &lt;CODE&gt;TZNTSTMPS&lt;/CODE&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a result, SAP automatically converted timestamps based on each user's time zone.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Domain with Conversion Routine:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="image.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350248i10F02E45DE41FE09/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="image.png" alt="image.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Table:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="image.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350250iE0C640F7A076221B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="image.png" alt="image.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Report:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="image.png" style="width: 712px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350219i7F87989184C7CC10/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="image.png" alt="image.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570046725"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution Approach&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Read timestamp values from the database.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Convert &lt;STRONG&gt;local timestamp → UTC timestamp&lt;/STRONG&gt; using:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;cl_kf_helper=&amp;gt;timestamp_local_zone_2_utc&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3.Populate the final internal table with the corrected timestamp.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4.Display the data using &lt;STRONG&gt;CL_SALV_TABLE&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By converting timestamps to UTC, the displayed values remain consistent for all users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&amp;amp;---------------------------------------------------------------------*

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In this blog post, we’ll explore how to implement a &lt;STRONG&gt;Hierarchical ALV&lt;/STRONG&gt; using the&lt;STRONG&gt; Factory Method &lt;/STRONG&gt;of the&amp;nbsp;CL_SALV_HIERSEQ_TABLE class.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1734258920"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In many SAP ERP scenarios, business users frequently work with data that follows a natural master–detail relationship, such as customers and their contacts, vendors and their company-code assignments, or materials and their storage locations. Presenting such related datasets in a clean and intuitive format is critical for efficient decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While traditional ALV is highly effective for displaying single-level tables, it becomes less practical when dealing with multi-level or dependent datasets. For these situations, SAP provides &lt;STRONG&gt;Hierarchical ALV&lt;/STRONG&gt; through the class &lt;STRONG&gt;CL_SALV_HIERSEQ_TABLE&lt;/STRONG&gt;, allowing developers to present complex data relationships in an expandable, easy-to-navigate layout within SAP GUI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog demonstrates how to create a hierarchical ALV using a vendor master table and its corresponding item details. The objective is to show how straightforward it is to bind two related datasets, define the hierarchy mapping, and display the result using SAP’s SALV framework—all with clean, maintainable ABAP code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1537745415"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We will work with two custom tables:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ZVA_VENDOR_TA&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;– Stores vendor master information (header level).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ZVA_VENDOR_ITEM&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; – Stores vendor-specific or company-code-specific details (item level).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The goal is to display these tables in a hierarchical ALV, where each vendor (header) can be expanded to reveal its associated item entries (detail).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CODE:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;REPORT ZVA_FACTORY_HIERACY_ALV.

" Declaration of internal tables and work areas for hierarchical ALV binding
DATA: LT_HIERSEQ TYPE SALV_T_HIERSEQ_BINDING,
      LS_HIERSEQ TYPE SALV_S_HIERSEQ_BINDING.

" Select vendor master data from custom table ZVA_VENDOR_TA
SELECT VENDERNO, NAME, CITY, POSTALCODE, EMAIL, ACCOUNTGROUP, PROCESSORGROUP, POSTINGBLOCK
  FROM ZVA_VENDOR_TA INTO TABLE (LT_VENDOR).

" Check if data is available in the LT_VENDOR table
IF sy-subrc = 0.

  " If vendor data exists, select corresponding vendor item details from ZVA_VENDOR_ITEM
  SELECT VENDERNO, COMPANYCODE, PERSONNELNUMBER, AUTHORGROUP, NTGEW, GEWEI, EKORG, STATUS
    FROM ZVA_VENDOR_ITEM INTO  TABLE (LT_VENDOR_ITEM).

ENDIF.

The class &lt;STRONG&gt;CL_SALV_HIERSEQ_TABLE&lt;/STRONG&gt; significantly simplifies the development process by handling the hierarchy logic internally, allowing developers to focus on data retrieval and business requirements rather than UI complexity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By implementing this approach, organizations can deliver reports that are not only visually clear but also easier for end users to navigate—especially when dealing with multi-level relational data. This technique remains highly relevant for SAP GUI-based reporting and continues to be an important part of the ABAP developer’s toolkit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If needed, this solution can be extended to support additional hierarchy levels, custom toolbar functions, or integration with business logic, making it flexible enough for advanced reporting scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/ABAP+Development/pd-p/833755570260738661924709785639136" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="314-1"&gt;ABAP Development&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Typically you would put your&amp;nbsp;ZSAPAssetManager also under version control.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;If you have additional changes to make you would make them in the same&amp;nbsp;ZSAPAssetManager project.&amp;nbsp; When deploying the .cim files in the base SAPAssetManager project control what is used.&amp;nbsp; If you have multiple CIM project the .cim files are processed in alphabetical order.&amp;nbsp; So if two extension projects indicate the same file is modified, the last .cim file processed wins.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;BR /&gt;You state that in debug the code in&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;EXIT_SAPL0VRF_001 is hit for both shipping points.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;In that case the memmory value should be 'Y' in both cases.&lt;BR /&gt;I deduct from your explanation that also the code in&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;MV50AFZ1 is hit and for one of the shipping points it is no longer 'Y'.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The reasons I can think of why it is not working are:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The value only gets set for the one shipping point and not for the second one.&lt;BR /&gt;But you stated that this was checked in debug and should be fine (just wanted to mention it again to double check)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The value gets cleared in the flow in between the two points.&lt;BR /&gt;- This could be either that the memory ID is already used for something else somewhere in between, this is hard to find because it could really be anywhere.&lt;BR /&gt;- The flow is just slightly different due to customizing, causing the non-working shipping point to use two sessions whereby the memory parameter is not available in a new session.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, what can you do:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Try to use a different memory parameter name, making it so specifically named that it is guaranteed to not be used anywhere&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use singleton class to buffer the value instead of working with export/import, this would also have the benefit that where used can be leveraged to find where it is set/read at any point in the future. But mostly it will give certainty that it is not used anywhere yet.&lt;BR /&gt;You can also use a watchpoint (or regular breakpoint) on the attribute of the singleton class to know exactly when it gets changed in the flow.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do a trace of both cases and check what is different.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This might take a lot of time.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope it can at least be of some use or bring new ideas for troubleshooting.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If you want to use ADT to create a BAdI, you can implement in Development Tenant 080. Refer to this blog:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-abap-environment-case-1-enhanced-goods/ba-p/13548856" target="_blank"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, ABAP Environmen... - SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;When you'd like to test BAdI, you should test in the Customizing Tenant 100. Also refer to this blog:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-abap-environment-case-3-custom-cds-view/ba-p/13560129" target="_blank"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, ABAP Environmen... - SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;If you create a custom CDS View in 080, you can test it in 100. From my point of view, it is same for custom BO.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Hope that can give you some help.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Zhehui&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear SAP experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I would need some support or clarification on whether the following is even possible:&lt;BR /&gt;In SuccessFactors Employee Central, I would like to use a business rule on &lt;STRONG&gt;Home Address Information&lt;/STRONG&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;default the country&lt;/STRONG&gt; when a new record is created and make the field&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;non-editable&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The background is that this should apply only to &lt;STRONG&gt;specific legal entities&lt;/STRONG&gt; (e.g. certain company codes). The behavior should work both when the &lt;STRONG&gt;user maintains the data themselves&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;on the Hire screen&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ideally, for the same legal entities and for &lt;STRONG&gt;existing records&lt;/STRONG&gt;, I would also like the &lt;STRONG&gt;country field to be non-editable (view-only)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is this technically possible? If not, could we discuss an &lt;STRONG&gt;alternative approach or workaround&lt;/STRONG&gt;?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you very much in advance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Michael&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1767297224"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;MDCA tool (Master Data consistency Analyzer) was previously called as MICE (Master Data Inconsistency Evaluator).&lt;BR /&gt;It can be used to identify the data inconsistencies across applications.CVI (Customer vendor integration), BP (Business partner), Address etc that are configured to the MDCA framework. All the inconsistencies in an application can be identified in one go, or inconsistencies can be identified for specific objects based on the selection criteria. MDCA tool can be considered as a one stop solution to identify all data inconsistencies for an application which will eventually save a lot of time and effort and ensure seamless process flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1441701000"&gt;Target audience&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Functional expert&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1245187495"&gt;Release Status&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This transaction MICE is in restricted release mode for exclusive use by SAP Support.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Results may not be accurate and may not reflect current state of data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Do not execute this transaction without written guidance from SAP. &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1048673990"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before Implementing the notes in the sequence listed below, please read the SAP Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;A class="" href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3353957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3353957.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Implement the SAP Notes listed below in strict sequence.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766589871"&gt;Recap on SAP-RPT-1&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As announced in TechEd this year, SAP-RPT-1 (in short for Relational Pre-trained Transformer) is our first-ever relational foundation model. Unlike traditional large language models that works primarily with unstructured text, SAP-RPT-1 is a table-native model that excels at understanding and predicting on your relational business data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As highlighted in our &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/a-new-paradigm-for-enterprise-ai-in-context-learning-for-relational-data/ba-p/14260221" target="_blank"&gt;technology blog post&lt;/A&gt;, SAP-RPT-1 enables in-context learning on your relational business data. This allows you to use the model out-of-the-box to gain business insights from your data, without the need for model training or fine-tuning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are excited to announce the general availability of SAP-RPT-1, our first step forward in making AI work seamlessly with the structured data that powers your business.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570076366"&gt;Model Variants&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have released two commercial variants of SAP-RPT-1 to meet different enterprise needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-RPT-1-small&lt;/STRONG&gt;: fast and lightweight version for medium complexity prediction, where low latency / high prediction throughput is in focus.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-RPT-1-large&lt;/STRONG&gt;: most powerful version for more complex prediction scenarios, when most accurate predictions and lowest error rates are the primary objective.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Both models support (multi-class, multi-target) classification and regression with up to 128 simultaneous prediction rows and up to 10 simultaneous prediction columns.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further characteristics can be seen from the following table:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-RPT-1-small&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-RPT-1-large&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Max Context Length&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;2k (2048) rows&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;64k (65536) rows&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Max Columns&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;100&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;256&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Number of Target Classes&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;256&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;1024&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please note that target class limits are recommendations only and, depending on the specific settings, scenarios with substantially more target classes may be addressable in some cases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For a balanced trade-off between prediction quality, inference speed and cost, SAP recommends using SAP-RPT-1-small with 500 – 2000 context rows, and SAP-RPT-1-large with 4000 – 8000 context rows. While individual scenarios may perform best in different settings, experimentation done at SAP has shown that these sizes work well for many enterprise use cases. It is also observed that SAP-RPT-1 often outperforms alternative methods on real-world enterprise data that contains semantics. Still, SAP recommends every customer to perform own experiments in the given application scenario on productive data for best outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Both models, SAP-RPT-1-small and SAP-RPT-1-large, are now available on SAP generative AI hub. With an AI Core instance under the extended plan, you will be able to access these model versions. and further technical information for each model version.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In addition to these commercial variants, SAP has released SAP-RPT-1-oss on &lt;A href="https://huggingface.co/SAP/sap-rpt-1-oss" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Hugging Face&lt;/A&gt;. This is a more lightweight, open-source variant of SAP-RPT-1, which we also described in &lt;A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10707" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;this research paper&lt;/A&gt;. It is intended to be used by researchers and enthusiasts for non-commercial purposes only.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373562861"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How to Get Started with SAP RPT 1&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1306132075"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;RPT Playground&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you are new to SAP-RPT-1, we have a &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/sap-rpt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;playground environment&lt;/A&gt; that allows you to test SAP-RPT-1 for free. It is mainly designed for exploration and building initial business cases with SAP-RPT-1. Please note that, in contrast to the commercial variants, the free version only allows predictions for up to 25 rows, 4 columns and 50 target classes. Also, rate limitations apply.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1109618570"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Generative AI hub&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As mentioned, the model variants for SAP-RPT-1 will be available on SAP generative AI hub. You will need to first deploy your desired model variant before you can start making inferences to the deployed model. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you are already using SAP generative AI hub, you can refer to our &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/generative-ai-hub/quick-start?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;help documentation&lt;/A&gt; and can get a headstart with SAP-RPT-1. Else, worry not as we will walk you through a complete step-by-step guide in our next blog post &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;– from deployment to your first inference with SAP-RPT-1!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-784022346"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Conclusion&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP-RPT-1 is now generally available and ready to power your enterprise applications. With SAP-RPT-1-small and SAP-RPT-1-large, you have the flexibility to select the right version for your needs. To learn more on the model versions, you can visit our &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/generative-ai-hub/sap-rpt-1?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;help guide&lt;/A&gt; for detailed information on model specifications, API specifications and best practices.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ready to transform how your organization leverages AI?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi SonTran,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you. Was this system behaviour updated perhaps in version 10? In our older versions GRPO also updated the LPP, to my knowledge anyway.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Johan&lt;/P&gt;</content>

KG as shown below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If yes, then it will eventually pass CS_LTAP-MOVEHU with value 'A' and then CS_LTAP-HOMVE is&amp;nbsp; marked&amp;nbsp; 'X'&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="8.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351592i04EFCE9ED5B44EF0/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="8.png" alt="8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So far, we have these values,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;but if you recall IV_HOMVE value inside the FM /SCWM/ROUTING_LAYOUT_CHECK&amp;nbsp; was 'A' not 'X'.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, we still need to see where this value is being updated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Here it is&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="9.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351593iBA51ABCEA81029F5/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="9.png" alt="9.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: You can notice here, CS_LTAP- MOVEHU value is passed into IV_HOMVE not CS_LTAP-HOMVE.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now if we continue, we can see that it finds the LOSC settings ,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;finally we will&amp;nbsp;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Exchanging sustainability data across supply chains can feel complex, especially when requirements are new, data formats differ, and time is limited. SAP Sustainability Data Exchange is designed to make this process easier for both &lt;STRONG&gt;customers and suppliers&lt;/STRONG&gt; by providing a secure platform for sharing standardized sustainability information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To ensure everyone can get started quickly and confidently, SAP is investing in &lt;STRONG&gt;guided onboarding and in-application support&lt;/STRONG&gt;, tailored specifically to external users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Support from Day One: &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/embed/public/vp/a/BYbn1Sq?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1265816&amp;amp;includeSapBrandedWraper=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Onboarding Video&lt;/A&gt; Available Today&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are a supplier or customer new to SAP Sustainability Data Exchange, help is already available.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP provides an &lt;STRONG&gt;onboarding video&lt;/STRONG&gt; that walk you through the whole set-up of the free supplier license (&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/business-network/sustainability-data-exchange/pricing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Store&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That video allows you to familiarize yourself with the solution &lt;STRONG&gt;before or during onboarding&lt;/STRONG&gt;, so you know what to expect and can avoid unnecessary delays.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s Coming Next: In-Application Guidance with WalkMe (April 2026)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Starting in &lt;STRONG&gt;April&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP Sustainability Data Exchange will introduce &lt;STRONG&gt;WalkMe&lt;/STRONG&gt;, an in-application guidance tool that supports you directly inside the platform.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of searching for manuals or contacting support, WalkMe will:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Guide you step by step through tasks inside the solution&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Provide contextual tips exactly where you need them&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Help you complete data submissions more easily and accurately&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This means you can focus on your data and business and not on learning a new system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why This Matters for Suppliers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For suppliers, sustainability data requests are increasing, often driven by customer requirements or regulations. WalkMe helps by:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Making onboarding faster and clearer&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reducing uncertainty around data entry&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Minimizing errors and rework&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;You don’t need to be an SAP expert. The platform guides you through each step as you work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why This Matters for Customers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For customers requesting sustainability data from suppliers, guided onboarding means:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Faster supplier participation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Better data quality and consistency&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Less manual follow-up and fewer clarification loops&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;When suppliers can onboard smoothly and submit data correctly the first time, everyone benefits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Simpler, More Supportive Experience&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Sustainability Data Exchange is designed to support collaboration, not create additional complexity. By combining &lt;STRONG&gt;onboarding videos available today&lt;/STRONG&gt; with &lt;STRONG&gt;in-application guidance through WalkMe starting in April&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP Sustainability Data Exchange helps customers and suppliers work together more efficiently from the very beginning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whether you are sharing data or requesting it, SAP Sustainability Data Exchange aims to make sustainability collaboration &lt;STRONG&gt;clear, guided, and scalable&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As someone working at a small or emerging biopharma organization, I'm sure you've recognized this scenario before: there just aren't enough hours in the day and then there's always some new scientific milestone that demands focus. Even discussing new technologies, much less researching or implementing them, feels like a luxury. It makes sense that your focus centers on finding and developing life-changing and life-saving therapies. But it is also where digitalization becomes quietly and increasingly important.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At SAP, we believe that our role should be to &lt;STRONG&gt;amplify your scientific breakthroughs&lt;/STRONG&gt;. By offering the correct digital platform, your organization can scale your innovation with confidence, knowing that all therapies are processed, controlled, and administered properly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Digitalization Matters for Cell and Gene Therapy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Of all the therapeutic areas, advanced personalized therapies remains the most complicated; it requires perfect coordination among patients, manufacturers, couriers, clinics, and partners. Digital orchestration plays a critical role in:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Minimizing human-generated errors&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enhancing regulatory compliance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Support scaling as therapies transition from clinical trials through to commercial launch&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Investing in digitalization is not solely an issue of operational efficiency. It enables biotechnology firms to focus on their core competency-developing therapies that change lives. Mixed with strong digital orchestration, breakthrough science will mean: &lt;SPAN&gt;The right therapy reaches the right patient, at the right time - safely, reliably, and at scale.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cell and Gene therapy Orchestration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP CGTO is designed to simplify and secure the complex orchestration of advanced personalized therapies. Here’s what makes it powerful:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage each step of supply chain orchestration &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integrate with partners (Sponsor/CMO) and logistics providers &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enable label management and integration &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-enabled exceptions management &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integrate with SAP S/4HANA out of the box &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Track and report Chain of Identity (COI) and Chain of Custody (COC) across systems &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Built-in analytics &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Support for Early-Stage Clinical Trials&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Early-stage clinical trials come with unique constraints, and smaller biotech need to carefully weigh the costs of implementing digital solutions. SAP's approach ensures that companies can engage with us without financial considerations holding them back from innovation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key strategies included offering a &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;configurable, standalone, GxP-compliant&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; solution for early-stage clinical trials that would &lt;STRONG&gt;minimize upfront investment&lt;/STRONG&gt; and complexity while keeping audit readiness. As programs progress toward commercialization, the platform supports incremental integration with ERP systems, CMOs/CDMOs, and courier partners. This phasing reduces risk, preserves validated workflows, and ensures scalability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business &amp;amp; Technical Benefits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Investment in digitalization with SAP has several strategic advantages&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Faster time-to-value with proven industry-standard solution&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Risk reduction with compliance features (GxP, PHI protection, audit trails)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;End-to-end orchestration for chain-of-identity and custody&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Future-proof design aligned with SAP Life Sciences’ roadmap and consortium updates&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clean core architecture lowers TCO and eliminates extensive custom build and maintenance effort&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cloud-native scalability powered by SAP BTP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Let’s Discuss&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How are you approaching digitalization in your CGT programs? What challenges have you faced in early-stage trials? Share your thoughts below!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP’s Cell and Gene Therapy Orchestration&amp;nbsp;solution provides an integrated platform that supports orchestration, compliance, and scalability, enabling life-science organizations to effectively manage personalized therapy processes. As teams advance next-generation treatments, the question is no longer whether digitalization is needed, but how early the right digital foundation should be adopted to support scientific progress without disruption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color="#0000FF"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Finally, if cost is stopping you from going digital, lets chat !!&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":handshake:"&gt;🤝&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;Thankyou &amp;amp; Regards!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;Monika Birdi &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

I would like to understand the whether the following scenario or not.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We need to display two tabs in the list report, but the first tab/entitySet contains breakout columns and custom toolbar buttons(controller and view extensions). The second tab should not contain any break outs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When I tried this, "&lt;SPAN&gt;Error: adding element with duplicate id &amp;lt;custom column&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;" error is coming. Is there anyway we can restrict the breakouts to particular tab or entity set instead for all the tabs?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In my&amp;nbsp;two&amp;nbsp;decades of&amp;nbsp;helping&amp;nbsp;organizations modernize their technology&amp;nbsp;landscape,&amp;nbsp;I’ve&amp;nbsp;observed&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;one&amp;nbsp;principle never&amp;nbsp;changes&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;faster&amp;nbsp;we innovate,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;complex&amp;nbsp;our&amp;nbsp;operations&amp;nbsp;get.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;shift&amp;nbsp;towards cloud adoption,&amp;nbsp;continuous&amp;nbsp;delivery,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;agility has&amp;nbsp;become unwavering,&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;it also&amp;nbsp;reveals&amp;nbsp;the fundamental&amp;nbsp;gaps&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;traditional&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For this reason,&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;firmly&amp;nbsp;believe&amp;nbsp;the future&amp;nbsp;belongs&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;those who implement&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;AI-First Ops&amp;nbsp;strategy&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;just to&amp;nbsp;automate workflows&amp;nbsp;but also&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;integrating&amp;nbsp;intelligence&amp;nbsp;and adaptability into&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;core&amp;nbsp;operations.&amp;nbsp;So, just&amp;nbsp;‘doing things faster’&amp;nbsp;won't&amp;nbsp;cut it anymore.&amp;nbsp;We&amp;nbsp;need to&amp;nbsp;take&amp;nbsp;more intelligent,&amp;nbsp;data-driven decisions&amp;nbsp;that equally consider speed, security,&amp;nbsp;and scalability without&amp;nbsp;compromising&amp;nbsp;quality.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1767297294"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;From Automation to Intelligence&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For years, businesses were dependent on rule-based automation for reactive systems.&amp;nbsp;It helped execute predefined tasks with&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;"if-this-then-that" logic&amp;nbsp;rules,&amp;nbsp;but&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;lacked&amp;nbsp;some perspective.&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;worked well when the&amp;nbsp;infrastructures&amp;nbsp;were&amp;nbsp;simpler, but&amp;nbsp;with today’s cloud-native, hybrid, and distributed environments, it&amp;nbsp;calls for extra&amp;nbsp;action. Hence, nowadays more&amp;nbsp;than&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://radixweb.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-statistics" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;80% of exe&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;cutives&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;leverage AI-based automation for&amp;nbsp;their business processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In an AI-First Ops model, we shift from rule-based systems to adaptive learning ecosystems.&amp;nbsp;AI consistently examines event data, metrics, and logs across the&amp;nbsp;organization&amp;nbsp;to predict&amp;nbsp;failure,&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;anomalies, and even address the issues before&amp;nbsp;they&amp;nbsp;lead&amp;nbsp;to consequences.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Machine learning algorithms and models are now capable of connecting millions of events instantly within seconds, which usually&amp;nbsp;takes&amp;nbsp;hours or days. This is about more than just&amp;nbsp;speed;&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;about converting data into valuable insights, which allows enterprises to drive innovation proactively and&amp;nbsp;confidently.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570783789"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integrating the Three Core Elements: Speed, Security, and Scalability&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Every CIO and CTO I have worked&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;encounters&amp;nbsp;the same trio of obstacles – how to expand without falling out of control, and how to speed up the delivery without sacrificing security.&amp;nbsp;The AI-First Ops model provides a structure to balance these conflicting demands.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1503353003"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Speed: Latest Golden Standard in Innovation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In today’s high-tech landscape, speed provides organizations with a competitive edge. Clients demand instant updates, intuitive experiences, and flawless uptime. Yet, traditional IT workflows struggle to thrive because&amp;nbsp;they’re&amp;nbsp;still&amp;nbsp;response-driven.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI helps predict these issues before they even happen. Just imagine your&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-driven system&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;recognizing performance degradation issues hours before a technical failure and&amp;nbsp;rectifying&amp;nbsp;issues without manual&amp;nbsp;intervention&amp;nbsp;or automatically reallocating resources. Well,&amp;nbsp;that’s&amp;nbsp;not a futuristic trend;&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;what modern AIOps platforms help with.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In one project based on enterprise transformation, I&amp;nbsp;observed&amp;nbsp;that AI-powered predictive maintenance reduces resolution times by 50% and minimizes incident frequency by 40%.&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;helped teams with&amp;nbsp;additional&amp;nbsp;time and higher focus on innovation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;That’s&amp;nbsp;the core of AI-First Ops: restoring focus and efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1306839498"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Security: Smarter Resilience in Action&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As organizations are&amp;nbsp;leveraging&amp;nbsp;remote and multi-cloud models,&amp;nbsp;there’s&amp;nbsp;an exponential rise in attack&amp;nbsp;surface. Yet many businesses find security as an&amp;nbsp;additional&amp;nbsp;part rather than an integrated feature. This needs to change.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI helps integrate intelligence directly into resilience. By examining behavioral patterns, AI-powered systems can spot anomalies that&amp;nbsp;alert&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;possible threats.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At&amp;nbsp;Radixweb,&amp;nbsp;we’ve&amp;nbsp;helped organizations deploy&amp;nbsp;AI-driven adaptive&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;cybersecurity frameworks&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&amp;nbsp;These&amp;nbsp;cutting-edge&amp;nbsp;systems produce prioritized&amp;nbsp;alerts for analysts, automatically isolate suspicious workflows, and evaluate incidents based&amp;nbsp;on contextual risks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is where AI stands out — not just&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;solving&amp;nbsp;issues&amp;nbsp;proactively&amp;nbsp;but also&amp;nbsp;in building systems to&amp;nbsp;predicting&amp;nbsp;them.&amp;nbsp;It transforms security into an adaptive process that reacts as quickly as attackers. And for tech leaders, it translates into&amp;nbsp;the freedom&amp;nbsp;to innovate fearlessly.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1110325993"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Scalability: Expansion made Seamless&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Scaling a system is not a Herculean task. Scaling&amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;smartly —&amp;nbsp;that’s&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;real challenge. As operations&amp;nbsp;scale,&amp;nbsp;the visibility&amp;nbsp;often diminishes. Teams might face&amp;nbsp;complexity spirals,&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;unpredictable&amp;nbsp;rise in workloads, and&amp;nbsp;lose control&amp;nbsp;of cloud expenses.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-first Ops model restores clarity via data-based scalability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;models help&amp;nbsp;businesses&amp;nbsp;grow, adjust&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;workloads, forecast demands, and even enhance resource allocation based on&amp;nbsp;utilization&amp;nbsp;patterns.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I worked with a global enterprise that used AI to predict seasonal traffic trends.&amp;nbsp;So, instead of&amp;nbsp;overallocating&amp;nbsp;resources just to be safe, their systems now&amp;nbsp;scale&amp;nbsp;automatically in real time, saving&amp;nbsp;nearly 35%&amp;nbsp;in yearly cloud expenses while&amp;nbsp;maintaining&amp;nbsp;efficiency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This kind of intelligence not only minimizes&amp;nbsp;cost, but&amp;nbsp;also&amp;nbsp;ensures&amp;nbsp;resilient growth.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-913812488"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Embedding an AI-Driven Ops Mindset&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integrating AI technology alone&amp;nbsp;won’t&amp;nbsp;help organizations achieve ‘AI-first tag’.&amp;nbsp;It’s&amp;nbsp;a cognitive shift — one that combines people,&amp;nbsp;process, and data. Over the years,&amp;nbsp;I’ve&amp;nbsp;seen the organizations who follow these key principles that successful adopters:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Unify your Data First&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Your&amp;nbsp;AI systems are only as good as the data it learns from. Centralize your operational data including logs, traces, metrics&amp;nbsp;into a single observability layer. Because scattered data results in scattered intelligence.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Design Continuous Learning Loops&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI should evolve with time. You can integrate feedback loops from incident resolutions, system productivity, and user behavior to keep models adaptive,&amp;nbsp;accurate, and on track.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integrate AI into DevOps Pipelines&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Don’t just consider AIOps as a standalone function. Integrate it throughout the CI/CD processes for automated testing, validation, and rollback. Unifying&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;DevOps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;and AIOps sustains a continuous learning and improvement ecosystem.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Prioritize Explainability&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As tech leaders, we&amp;nbsp;have to&amp;nbsp;believe AI decisions, however, this belief majorly comes from transparency. &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;You can&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;leverage&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;ex&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;plainable AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;(XA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;I&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;) to ensure your teams understand why some models make certain suggestions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Team Empowerment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Upskilling is the most crucial part of empowering your team. You can help and encourage your IT teams to go from administrators to strategists — experts who can easily interpret AI insights and drive automation with business goals.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-588216264"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-First Ops Strategy: Unlocking Business Impact Beyond IT&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An AI-First Ops strategy is not just limited to IT —&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;a growth catalyst. The influence goes far beyond traditional performance indicators:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Adherence to compliance protocols solidifies since AI is consistently enforcing audit readiness and governance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Innovation accelerates because teams can iterate faster and are free to experiment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There's&amp;nbsp;a reduction in operational costs due to the automation of redundant tasks and resources optimization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Client experience improves as digital solutions get more responsive and downtime reduces.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-520785478"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Paving the Way for Autonomous Enterprises&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I often say that AI-First Ops marks the beginning of a significant transformation towards autonomous businesses—a future where AI-based systems are self-learning, self-healing, self-improving, and self-guarding.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;However,&amp;nbsp;this self-governance&amp;nbsp;doesn’t&amp;nbsp;refer to a lack of control. It relates to intelligent control,&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;human knowledge drives AI accuracy. The&amp;nbsp;objective&amp;nbsp;isn’t&amp;nbsp;substituting your&amp;nbsp;employees,&amp;nbsp;it's&amp;nbsp;empowering them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As business leaders,&amp;nbsp;it's&amp;nbsp;our role to balance these aspects — speed, security, and scalability — with an objective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/aiops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AIOps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;allows us to align these elements, ensuring faster execution, secure processes, and higher scalability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The businesses that strike the perfect equilibrium will pioneer the next era of digital leadership. And I&amp;nbsp;firmly believe&amp;nbsp;that those embracing the AI-First Ops mindset will set the benchmark for the future.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi Lakshmipathi Ji, Thank you very much for your valuable response. We had similar thoughts, as we currently have limited options to update the inventory as an initial step toward implementing the production process. The stock volume and variety are quite large, with multiple grades, sizes, etc., all generated from the same input material. Additionally, at each 501 generation, significant manual intervention is required to complete the batch classifications that is the challenge we are facing now. your input was much helpful in deciding the 201&amp;amp;501 process.</content>

You do not need any background in the topic, but you should have&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;a lot of curiosity!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this CodeJam, you will learn how to use the Generative AI Hub on SAP AI Core to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This approach improves the responses of large language models (LLMs) and reduces hallucinations. You will learn how to deploy an LLM and the orchestration service on SAP AI Core, and how to query it via SAP AI Launchpad and the Python SDK. Additionally, you will gain insights into key generative AI concepts and learn how to enhance RAG responses.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;free&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;in-person event&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and is planned for&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wednesday, January 21st, 2026&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;in&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hyderabad&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;from &lt;STRONG&gt;09:00 to 15:30 IST&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&amp;nbsp;The language of the event and the content will be in English.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The event is kindly hosted by &lt;STRONG&gt;Phoenix Business Consulting India Pvt Ltd&lt;/STRONG&gt; .

    <content>Yes I don't understand what "Varpay Basis Amount Calculation" means either. When integrated with EC, basis field calc is captured by run bonus calc that triggers at the end of the Employee History job.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This topic has been extensively covered in other thread in the community, type "N/A" or "N/A formula". Most likely an issue with the way the formula is written, lacking a condition or an issue with the format of one of the attributes.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Yes, once you have the artifacts available in the SAP IS tenant, you can do modifications to the artifacts directly in the cloud integration workspace and the changes will be reflected in the SPROXY navigation tree. Then you can regenerate the proxy. Hope this clarifies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please feel free to contact us incase you face any issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi, for Fiori Apps parameters are taken over of the task list e.g. ledger, company code. You can maintain them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Parameters you only can and need maintain for task type JOB.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thomas&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Daniel,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Document types are not version depended. But you should have the option to create a validation rule in the fiori app for substitution/validation to allow only one specific version to post to the document type.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP help has the function described:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/4ebf1502064b406c964b0911adfb3f01/2447037c6bd54e7796d11d9743c84996.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=2023.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/4ebf1502064b406c964b0911adfb3f01/2447037c6bd54e7796d11d9743c84996.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=2023.003&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Br&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Martin Jul&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1730445917" id="toc-hId-1766437254"&gt;Summary&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;With geopolitical tensions growing and governments becoming more protectionistic in policy-making, enterprises are preparing for a more localized, de-globalized world. This article describes observations from the SAP Transformation Hub on the impact on instance strategy and gives advice on what enterprises should consider when making decisions on their instance strategy.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569923749"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Decision making on Instance Strategy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;SAP has a proven methodology and best practice criteria that have helped hundreds of enterprise customers of all sizes to make decisions on their instance strategy. The set of criteria is explained in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-architecture-knowledge-base/deciding-on-sap-instance-strategy/ta-p/122934" target="_blank"&gt;this blog&lt;/A&gt; and a whitepaper that describes considerations for splitting and consolidating instances is available for download &lt;A href="https://d.dam.sap.com/a/JAAUmx/WhitePaper_ProductionSystemStrategy_v3.6.pdf?rc=10&amp;amp;inline=true&amp;amp;doi=SAP552384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;. Due to the increase of relevancy and growing interest in de-globalization, 2 new criteria have been added recently: geopolitical risks and legal compliance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373410244"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What aspects on de-globalization should enterprises consider?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;1. Enterprises with multinational operations are confronted with increasing geopolitical risks impacting their IT landscape. Proper risk management requires examining different scenarios from sanctions and export control for technology, data espionage, control cross border data flow to sudden disruption of data transfer. Changes in geopolitical situations may require re-assessing instance strategy options. The resilience of the architecture to sustain events needs to be looked at. Drawing on enterprise architecture dimensions enhances the assessment of instance strategy in the context of geopolitical risks&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-roman"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;: In times of crisis, countries may try to protect their economy by regulations and limitations such as mandatory business operations completely in the country and control data residency and flow. Consequently, enterprises need to be able to operate critical capabilities locally to ensure business continuity. Turning to business architecture helps evaluate which capabilities are critical for operations in countries at risk. If risk assessment concludes to proactive risk mitigation, these capabilities could be encapsulated and supported by local ringfenced building blocks, e.g. for order-to-cash on a local ERP while consolidating local finance in a corporate system.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;: for countries-at-risk, the criticality of operations running on global applications needs to be evaluated. A local instance may be required, or local data persistence in the form of archiving may need to be established. To achieve the desired level of resilience in critical areas, applications need to be duplicated and deployed locally to ensure continuity in times of crisis.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Questions that guide towards a proper assessment of the risk can include: Which types of data are being processed? How critical is the data? Where does the data flow and reside physically? What are the security and privacy measures implemented? Is there end-to-end encryption? Can I afford exposing my global data to governmental intelligence services? What would happen if the data would suddenly not be available? How difficult are changes to data provisioning?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Relevant questions for assessing the risk include: Where are my data centres located? Are there sufficient security measures implemented in data centre operations? Where are my cloud vendors located? Under which jurisdiction do they operate?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="text-align : justify; padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;It is impossible for global acting enterprises to be completely free from geopolitical dependencies. The more transparency into enterprise architecture is available in all dimensions, though, the easier it is to identify and mitigate risk.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;An increasing number of &lt;STRONG&gt;new laws and regulations&lt;/STRONG&gt; are being issued by governments all over the world around data protection and cybersecurity, which forces global acting enterprises to adapt.&amp;nbsp; Prime examples of recent years include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) in Brazil or the China Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) in China, which provides similar measures.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;Usually, governments give enterprises time to become compliant with new laws. Enterprises first need to interpret and determine what it means for their operations before implementing concrete measures in their systems&lt;/FONT&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1176896739"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Trends in Customer's decision making&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;In the past, we have observed a trend across industries for consolidation of instances. Driven by the availability of scaling infrastructure, large enterprises with global operations were able to realize considerable business benefits by harmonizing business processes and simplifying landscapes. Those enterprises whose business is truly global in nature were able to benefit from capabilities such as single source of truth for customer, inventory, etc. as well as more LoB specific functions such as global supply chain planning. The trend towards consolidation in general continues but we have observed situations where customers have deviated from plans of a single global instance and shifted to a more modular architecture driven by considerations on de-globalization. A controlled decoupling of critical applications is an approach enterprises are following to better manage risks. The higher the geopolitical risk, the more attractive are sovereign cloud options which are now evolving fast in response to customer demand.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-980383234"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;Decisions on instance strategy have a large impact on transformation programs and require a holistic perspective with considerations on business strategy, IT operations, deployment and technology. While aspects on deglobalization gain in importance, enterprises need to integrate geopolitical risk and legal compliance when making instance strategy decisions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;While implementing laws and regulation can be planned, geopolitical risk requires a different treatment. Landscape options should be evaluated considering resilience towards mitigating geopolitical risks and how regulation on data privacy, protection and localization can be facilitated. Landscape options providing higher agility and resilience towards possible geopolitical disruptions and those that are easier to adapt to new regulation are becoming more attractive.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Suleyman,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It might be due to your breakdown category assigned to your FS item.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I created an adobe form for SD order printing. There is a value field based on data element NETWR, for which I set up a field based on WAERS as currency field in the same structure. I use num.currency{} as pattern for the output.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When I use the form from the application (create output via NAST), all works fine. However, when I try to do a test run (run the form function from the SE37 test environment), it doesn't work. I filled EUR in the currency field, but the preview creates an output like "$ 100.00"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is this a known issue?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello SAP Community,&lt;BR /&gt;I'm working on an SAP Business ByDesign implementation and have a question regarding Custom Codes in Account Assignment Types.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Background:&lt;BR /&gt;According to the configuration guide, we can define Custom Code 1, 2, and 3 as additional account assignments for Account Assignment Types. The documentation mentions that "The custom codes are also available for selection and aggregation in reports."&lt;BR /&gt;Question:&lt;BR /&gt;I would like to confirm the following regarding Custom Codes (1/2/3):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reporting: Can these Custom Codes be displayed as separate columns when creating custom reports in Business ByDesign? Are they available in standard data sources for report creation?&lt;BR /&gt;Data Extraction: Can these Custom Codes be retrieved programmatically for integration purposes? (e.g., via OData API, Web Services, or other integration methods)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use Case:&lt;BR /&gt;We need to extract financial data including these custom account assignments for integration with external systems, and want to understand the technical feasibility before proceeding with the configuration.&lt;BR /&gt;Any guidance or documentation references would be greatly appreciated.&lt;BR /&gt;Thank you in advance for your help!&lt;BR /&gt;Best regards,&lt;/P&gt;</content>

You will learn the basics of SAP Build Process Automation (projects, triggers, conditions, creating instances, monitoring, and the Inbox), and also use some of the more recent or advanced features (event triggers, form events, waiting for a API callback).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Bring your own laptop with power adapter and have a supported Web browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox installed on your laptop.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It can be helpful to bring a tablet or second laptop, if you have.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Complete these prerequisites and the required reading BEFORE you come:&amp;nbsp;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/codejam-events-process-introduction.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Introduction to the CodeJam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/codejam-events-process-0-prerequisites.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Required reading:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/codejam-events-process-1-bah.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1 - Exploring Events and More in the SAP Business Accelerator Hub&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/codejam-events-process-2-eda.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2 - Why Event-Driven Architectures?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Location and Date&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is an&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;in-person&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;event only (not virtual) and is planned for&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Thursday, January 29th, 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;from 9:30 - 16:00 local time in Bengaluru, India.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/10529"&gt;@DianaRoesner&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yesterday,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;I had attended the SAP BTP - Solution Architect exam via AI Roleplay. The exam started and had answered all questions well and got a AI reply saying that 'It was under review'. I had waited for 5-10mins. Then checked via voice call. Once again AI mode started from the beginning and i had answered all the questions clearly. During this process , Save and view analysis button is not ENABLED. I had tried in total of 4 times. Still no luck. Then I had restarted my exam. After that, i had started once again and got all the questions from AI mode and answered well. This time also no luck. Got the message as 'Time's up' screen closed. Exactly, at which point of time the&amp;nbsp;Save and View analysis button will get ENABLED. Will it gets automatically ENABLED or we need to click any button. How do we know the AI Roleplay question session is completed? And how to get back the lost attempt (which have no result).Kindly advise on this. Thanks in advance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Harsh_Joshi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In an intercompany STO scenario, the billing document is indeed created first by the supplying company after goods issue. This intercompany billing document is then sent to the receiving company, and invoice verification (MIRO) is carried out with reference to this billing document, not directly against the delivery.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So the sequence is:&lt;BR /&gt;Goods Issue --&amp;gt; Intercompany Billing --&amp;gt; Invoice Verification in receiving company.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope this clarifies your doubt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Leelamohan&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/8892"&gt;@Andre_S&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Thanks for your comment.&lt;BR /&gt;You are right, within current B1 Architecture, components have dependency on SLD and Authentication service&amp;nbsp;at runtime for landscape discovery, user authentication and tenant/DB resolution.&lt;BR /&gt;As a result both SLD and Authentication service need to be accessible. By using &amp;nbsp;the Nginx template you can minimize exposure to a single URL and Port for both.&lt;BR /&gt;Any deviation from this setup would require a deep ARC change I'm affraid.&lt;BR /&gt;Feel free to share your idea for potential future improvements and get community's vote on it via Customer influence &lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/campaign/887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/campaign/887&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Best Regards&lt;BR /&gt;Guy&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Thanks for the detailed response, in my case we usually create Purchase orders with "Text Items" and keep them in the warehouse but these text items doesn't include any material master. How to handle this? we are planning to implement EWM basic .</content>

    <title>Cleaning Zero and Blank Base Cost Records in SAP Analytics Cloud BW Live for Clear Variance Trends</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In BW Live–based cost analysis, variance trends are often affected by records that contain &lt;STRONG&gt;zero or blank Base Cost values&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;These records usually belong to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Old projects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pass-through orders&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Closure or migrated projects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Including them in trend analysis makes charts noisy and less meaningful for management discussions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What the Execute Button Does&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the user clicks the &lt;STRONG&gt;Execute&lt;/STRONG&gt; button:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;WBS TOPs with &lt;STRONG&gt;zero or blank Base Cost values&lt;/STRONG&gt; are removed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The remaining records are used to calculate:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Approximate cumulative variance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Year-wise variance trend&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The chart becomes easier to read and interpret&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the same time, the story still provides:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;One table and chart &lt;STRONG&gt;with all records&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;One table and chart &lt;STRONG&gt;without zero or blank records&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This gives full transparency to the user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Important Business Clarification&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Removing these WBS TOPs &lt;STRONG&gt;does not impact the actual variance calculation&lt;/STRONG&gt; in a material way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reason:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Zero or blank Base Cost values appear mainly in &lt;STRONG&gt;Main&amp;nbsp;projects&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;These projects are mostly old or pass-through in nature&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Proper Base Cost and Actuals are correctly tracked in &lt;STRONG&gt;Sub- projects&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;So the filtered view improves &lt;STRONG&gt;visual clarity&lt;/STRONG&gt;, not financial accuracy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Design Approach in SAP Analytics Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The solution uses a &lt;STRONG&gt;helper table–based dynamic filtering pattern&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;High-level logic:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Read data from a helper table&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Identify WBS TOPs with non-zero Base Cost&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Collect only valid WBS TOP IDs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Apply the filter dynamically to:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Main chart&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Main table&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Remove the filter automatically if no valid records exist&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This logic runs only when the user clicks &lt;STRONG&gt;Execute&lt;/STRONG&gt;, keeping the story fast.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Simplified SAC Script &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;// Source helper table&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;var dsSource = Table_Helper.getDataSource();&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;// Target chart and table&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;var dsTargetChart = Chart_Main.getDataSource();&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;var dsTargetTable = Table_Main.getDataSource();&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;// Read result set&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;var rs = dsSource.getResultSet();&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;var validWbsList = ArrayUtils.create(Type.string);&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;// Collect WBS TOPs with non-zero and non-blank Base Cost&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;for (var i = 0;

By combining helper tables and dynamic dimension filtering, you get better insights without compromising data integrity.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Similar to the LLMs, the model versions will be available in the Model Library within generative AI hub. You can use SAP AI Launchpad to navigate AI Core functionalities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Do read our latest &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/artificial-intelligence-blogs-posts/sap-rpt-1-enterprise-ai-for-relational-data-now-generally-available/ba-p/14287926" target="_self"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt;, where we&amp;nbsp;explained the model versions in detail. We will also be releasing a second blog post shortly which contains a step-by-step guide on how to get started with SAP-RPT-1.&lt;/P&gt;</content>
