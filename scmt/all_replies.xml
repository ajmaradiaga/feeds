    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A utility company embarked on a transformative project focusing on process harmonization, establishing an ERP core as its backbone, and leveraging a merger with another enterprise to standardize processes while transitioning to S/4HANA. The rollout spanned a six-year roadmap involving more than 400 companies, 10+ countries, and over 30,000 SAP users.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The project’s complexity demanded significant attention and dedication. By its conclusion, the global team included around 10 workstreams, 25+ teams, and over 250 employees. What were the key success factors that enabled such an extensive and successful engagement?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Effective Planning&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thorough planning and preparation are fundamental to ensuring seamless cooperation and a successful go-live. In this case, the utilities company’s rollout adopted a targeted approach with clear goals. The initial rollouts for two pilot companies served as test runs to refine subsequent rollouts based on initial lessons learned.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In order to establish a Fit-to-Standard approach, a binding S/4HANA template was established, which was as closely aligned with SAP standards as possible, given the financial framework based on the analysis of the legal gaps. The template was built with the experts from all units to cover all requirements, which were later rolled out as the standard. Any exceptional requirements to enhance the template required a clear economic rationale, and local units had to justify the added value in case there were additional requirements. Remaining close to the SAP standard minimized the need for time-consuming custom developments, ensuring a rapid and efficient rollout. This approach minimized risks, controlled scope expansion, and reduced operational costs. The pilots tested the core template and helped derive valuable experience for a broader implementation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Furthermore, the utilities company opted for a factory approach during the rollout of the project. Each factory had its tasks and responsibilities. The Test Factory, for example, ensured that E2E processes were tested and compliant with auditing standards and automation tools. The Migration Factory focused on data migrations with a specific standardized approach and tools to scale the migrations. The Cutover Factory ensured a successful and efficient go-live by leveraging cutover and steering tools, such as cutover plans and blueprints. The Communication and Change Factory’s task was to ensure the readiness of the people by informing, activating, and enabling all users with the respective knowledge transfer.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The utilities company’s “factory approach” balanced centralized governance with local execution. Central teams managed core activities like design, testing, and migration through specialized units, ensuring consistency and quality. Meanwhile, local teams addressed region-specific needs. This model fostered collaboration between central and local efforts, streamlining delivery and aligning global standards with local requirements. It enabled scalable, efficient rollouts by establishing a lean, standardized process and tool usage and ensuring transparency of all rollout steps.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Program Methodology and Governance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The customer opted for the SAP Activate methodology utilizing SAP Solution Manager (hereafter called SolMan) / Focus Build to ensure maximum transparency and run the project in an agile mode, enabling engagement of internal resources and time-efficient delivery despite COVID-19 remote work restrictions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the design and realization phase, the program scope was broken into three main waves, which were delivered by scrum teams, resulting in various agile sprint teams. SAP SolMan was the single source of truth, providing transparency and using scrum boards to ensure that all topics were tracked. The project also had clear guidelines and quality criteria, such as criteria for test completion and resulting documentation. The overall agile methodology, as well as SAP SolMan, resulted in the timely delivery of qualitative results by being responsive to changing requirements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Strong program governance was another crucial factor. Initiatives of varying sizes and scopes benefit from centralized management and logical team clusters. Efficient project management methodologies and program leadership can significantly impact outcomes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The utilities company’s governance structure included a lean finance stream supported by parallel integration and technology streams. Agile scrum teams managed deliverables dynamically, with 20 such teams driving the project forward. Over 90% of the scope was implemented within SAP standards due to robust and strict governance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Strong governance also facilitated risk mitigation. Centrally organized meetings provided visibility to address key challenges promptly, such as restaffing roles when necessary. The utilities company and SAP collaboratively tackled issues, ensuring success through cross-team performance and motivated staff.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Structured Rollout Phases: The Core Fit2Standard Timeline&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A critical enabler of the successful rollout was the structured sequencing of rollout phases within the Core Fit2Standard framework.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Seda_Agasarjan_0-1760329010599.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326263iA228CB5404C6D0BC/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Seda_Agasarjan_0-1760329010599.png" alt="Seda_Agasarjan_0-1760329010599.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The utilities company adopted a phased approach that guided each rollout unit through clear steps of preparation, analysis, validation, and approval, ensuring alignment across all entities.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The process began with Local Units’ Preparation, where onboarding, the collection of local information, and team setup established the foundation. This was followed by System Demos, introducing system landscape concepts and demonstrating template processes to ensure familiarity and clarity. The Local System Analysis phase identified requirements and gaps, including necessary local adjustments. These findings then moved into Template Validation, where potential gaps were discussed, categorized, and prioritized transparently.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After validation, the Review and Approval stage involved product owners and management making final decisions on gaps and their solutions, creating an efficient and constructive core Fit2Standard process. Finally, the Upload and Planning phase ensured that requirements were transferred to the backlog, dependencies were assessed, and handovers to the template team were executed smoothly.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key success factors for this structured rollout included proactive participation in info sessions, thorough self-studies, and the use of InfoCollectors for pre-filled data gathering. Alignment between central and local units was emphasized, with local teams responsible for ensuring that regional requirements (e.g., legal obligations) were adequately addressed. Open discussion of potential gaps, along with clear prioritization, built trust and enabled efficient resolution. This structured phasing fostered transparency, minimized surprises, and kept the program aligned with the overall project roadmap.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Collaboration and Empowerment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Collaboration across teams and the entire project ecosystem is vital for smooth implementation. Effective change management—encompassing stakeholder management, awareness building, and resistance mitigation—creates confidence and unity among affected teams.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The utilities company prioritized collaboration by adopting the philosophy “from us for us,” engaging business, IT, central, regional teams, and partners. High levels of internal resource commitment ensured everyone actively contributed to the rollout. This large-scale engagement resulted in seamless cooperation among all parties involved.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;One key lesson learned was the importance of separating program steering from content steering. Trusting system and topic owners to act in the company’s best interest proved invaluable. Addressing challenges directly as they arose ensured smooth progress. Additionally, a clear escalation procedure minimized hurdles and effort, contributing to the project’s success.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Furthermore, a key element of the project was the decision and escalation path, which vested more than 80% of the decisions by the product owners. These individuals took ownership and made decisions once unresolved topics were escalated to them. Product Managers were granted the mandate to make decisions related to cross-team matters. In this way, the product owners were empowered to take decisions and remained engaged, sharing a vested interest in the project’s success.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Driving Success in Rollout Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The utilities company’s rollout exemplifies the principles of successful SAP implementations, especially for complex solutions like S/4HANA. Key factors included:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Effective Planning:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Careful preparation, piloting, and the establishment of a binding Fit-to-Standard template ensured clarity of scope and minimized unnecessary custom developments.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Program Methodology and Governance:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; A robust governance framework, supported by the SAP Activate methodology and SAP Solution Manager, delivered alignment, transparency, and adaptability through agile execution and strong risk management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Structured Rollout Phases:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; A transparent, phased Core Fit2Standard timeline guided each rollout unit from preparation through to planning, ensuring alignment across all entities and fostering consistent execution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Collaboration and Empowerment:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Unified teams with clearly defined responsibilities, empowered product owners, and a collaborative “from us for us” philosophy fostered stakeholder engagement, accelerated decision-making, and ensured project ownership.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This case study demonstrates how disciplined planning, structured rollout phases, strong governance, and a collaborative culture can transform daunting challenges into scalable successes. For organizations embarking on similar transformative journeys, these strategies are not just recommended—they are essential.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The lessons learned extend beyond technology. They highlight the importance of structure, discipline, and unity in navigating complex rollouts. By adopting these principles, organizations can achieve their goals while maintaining operational excellence and driving meaningful change.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;********&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Co-Author: Oliver-Jens&amp;nbsp;Götz&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/809347"&gt;@MariaSanz&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Good day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me put it this way. I have asked question in the common forum for a question, and I got the response as well. But I am not fully answered so I want to ask the follow-up question to the same person who answered my question. So, I added a comment by counter questioning, but I didn't get the response back. So, I have privately asked the same to that person by clicking on the person's name and wrote my message to him. Here, I want to know the status on my question to him. Like I don't know where to check the question that I privately asked to someone. I can only see the questions and replies related to me from the common community but to check the statuses on the questions that I asked in private I need assistance. I hope my query is clear to you now.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope to hear soon from you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In enterprise integration scenarios, managing employee data across systems is a common requirement — but raw data is often messy or incomplete.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this blog, we’ll walk through a real-world solution in SAP Integration Suite (CPI) where we:&lt;BR /&gt;• Filter out invalid employee records using Message Mapping&lt;BR /&gt;• Sort valid employee records by EmployeeID using Groovy Script&lt;BR /&gt;• Deliver a clean and structured employee dataset to the target system&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The goal is to streamline incoming employee data so it’s ready for consumption by downstream applications.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Requirement&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;We needed to:&lt;BR /&gt;• &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt; Remove employees missing EmployeeID&lt;BR /&gt;• &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt; Preserve only complete records with all required fields&lt;BR /&gt;• &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt; Sort the remaining employee records in ascending order by EmployeeID&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This reflects a common need in systems like SAP SuccessFactors, SAP HCM, or third-party HR tools where employee records must be clean and ordered.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The entire filtering and sorting of employee data could be handled using just a Groovy script. However, here I chose to use Message Mapping for filtering and Groovy only for sorting.&lt;BR /&gt;This approach helps demonstrate how standard tools in SAP CPI can be combined effectively — and it’s especially helpful for beginners learning both graphical and scripting options.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":gear:"&gt;⚙️&lt;/span&gt;Tools Used&lt;BR /&gt;• SAP Integration Suite (CPI)&lt;BR /&gt;• Message Mapping – to filter out incomplete data&lt;BR /&gt;• Groovy Script – to sort valid data&lt;BR /&gt;• No external tools, APIs, or adapters needed&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Better Picture&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp;

remove any &amp;lt;Employee&amp;gt; node where EmployeeID is missing or empty.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Functions Used:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;• &lt;U&gt;removeContext&lt;/U&gt;

    <content>Customer not interested in doing any more development on Current BW 7.0 system. We need few years of historic data and would like to load data from BW 7.0 to datasphere as one time activity . We dont have Open hubs. Can we directly create Generate Export datasource on BW infoproviders and connect to datasphere using replication flows? If this approch does not work, Will it work to export Infoproviders huge volume of data to csv/excel and then load to Datasphere? Cant we bypass ETL tools for this solution? Or is it manditory use BODS as ETL tool to migrate data to Datasphere? Sorry for asking many questions at once. Just trying best to directly migrate data to Datasphere</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Karthik S,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;unless an FPM Event is connected with the user action, you can fetch all the FPM events during the FPM Event Loop in UIBB methods PROCESS_EVENT (-&amp;gt; PAI), GET_DATA, or PROCESS_BEFORE_OUTPUT (-&amp;gt; PBO).

    <content>&lt;P&gt;SAP Alert Notification Service&amp;nbsp;is a powerful service available on the Business Technology Platform (BTP) that helps you to monitors your applications and sends alerts when something goes wrong like an application crash so you can take immediate action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Few things to which are required to setup beforehand:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A subaccount in SAP BTP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A space created within that subaccount.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Required services&amp;nbsp;(capm) deployed in that space to enable monitoring.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To use the Alert Notification Service, it must be subscribed within your BTP subaccount.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now Let's create and configure Alert Notification Service&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Arish1_1-1758266201206.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316823iB6A6CF7A511F05B5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Arish1_1-1758266201206.png" alt="Arish1_1-1758266201206.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once Create, Make sure this configuration is enabled already within the instance parameters&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Arish1_2-1758266588430.png" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316826iA05883989F5F2E75/image-dimensions/500x325?v=v2" width="500" height="325" role="button" title="Arish1_2-1758266588430.png" alt="Arish1_2-1758266588430.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;There are few terms which is very important and are explained below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Events: These are the triggers specific occurrences like application crashes that the system watches for.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Actions: These define what should happen when a particular event is detected&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Subscription: This is the link between events and actions.

This was created for a different purpose, so feel free to&amp;nbsp;ignore it&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;during your setup - it’s not relevant to the current configuration.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Click&amp;nbsp;Save, and just like that&amp;nbsp;you’ve successfully created a subscription!&amp;nbsp;Your Alert Notification Service is now ready to listen for events and take action as configured.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;P&gt;From now on, whenever a service crashes within the&amp;nbsp;same space&amp;nbsp;where your Alert Notification Service instance is set up, you’ll receive an&amp;nbsp;email notification,&amp;nbsp;just like the one shown below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Arish1_11-1758269451888.png" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316847i6D26A7CD77C7555A/image-dimensions/500x216?v=v2" width="500" height="216" role="button" title="Arish1_11-1758269451888.png" alt="Arish1_11-1758269451888.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Using SAP Alert Notification Service, we can now monitor services in real time. If any service crashes, we’ll receive instant alerts containing detailed information about the event.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Readers,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm working on project for migration of CSB to UDM (FO Location to GO Job Location) and I would really like to know what will be the impact on third party job boards after this migration. How can we manage the impact? How job boards will able to continue the job posting after this migration. Looking forward for best practice and approach to handle the impact and implementation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;/Akanksha&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi there,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Can you provide more use cases of this new feature?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the what's new viewer, the use case is very vague. It talks more about how to configure it then what you could do with it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this blog I have explained the mechanism of total etag&amp;nbsp; and also differnce between&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;E-TAG and total etag in RAP in restful abap programming model&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introduction :&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ETAG: the etag concept ensures that&amp;nbsp; the end user of an Odata service only changes instances with the state that is displayed on the UI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hence , the etag prevents changes of the BO that are not noticed by the Odata consumers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.W&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ith Etag master each BO&amp;nbsp; entity can be checked independently.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;TOTAL E-TAG:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It enables optimistic concurrency checks durig the transition from draft to active data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This total etag field on the database table is updated by the RAP runtime framework as soon as an active instance is changed&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Its value is compared when resuming a draft instance to ensure that the active data has not been changed after the exclusive lock has expired&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The total E-tag is used for edit-drafts, a draft that has a corresponding active instance .&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As soon as the exclusive lock expires and&amp;nbsp; an edit-draft is resumed , the total etag value of the draft is compared to the total ETAG value of the active instance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The total etag is compared for all entities of BO&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Total e-tag is useful when we are changing draft data to active data .&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Pradeep555_0-1758777107961.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/319637iDB81940A0646880F/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Pradeep555_0-1758777107961.png" alt="Pradeep555_0-1758777107961.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;why total etag? and scenario&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Suppose an application is not using draft concepts ,&amp;nbsp; if it is only using e-tag then that application is also modifying the same table&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;E-tag will work whenever we are loading the data in the front end , someone else changes the data&amp;nbsp; and&amp;nbsp; unknowingly&amp;nbsp; saving the data – etag will be compered&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In&amp;nbsp; order to save the data and override we use etag&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SCENARIO:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When we start working on a draft table , we will put exclusive lock on active instance (say BOOKING ID-1)so that nobody can change the data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Active data base--&amp;gt;it will become active instance--&amp;gt; active instance to it will become draft instance&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Suppose&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp; have made some changes in active instance and – forgot to save it ,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;But it will be automatically saved in draft instance – as we are working on draft&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Chages made will be automatically saved in draft table&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As soon as we stop working – the exclusve lock will be removed from active instance (BOOKING ID-1)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So now&amp;nbsp; the I&amp;nbsp; will come again ad start working on the draft instance which&amp;nbsp; have&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Saved , again&amp;nbsp; I will put exclusive lock and make some changes in the data and save it .&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As soon as we save – draft instance will be converted into active instance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What happens if we don't use total eTag?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Suppose somebody else did some changes and those changes are not saved in draft&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;the app is not using draft )&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;And we will be overwriting those changes with our changes, since we don't exactly now&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; w&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;hether someone eles has changed the data or not&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Total etag will be matched automatically based on the field &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;@Semantics.systemDateTime.lastChangedAt: true&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We need to match these field in behaviour definition&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The framework will update total etag field each time --&amp;gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Jand,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. With the help of the network administrator, enable tracing either from outside to inside or from the internal VPN network to the server LAN to check which ports are being blocked by the firewall when accessing the SAP system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Based on your SAP application, you can check the port details for different SAP productions from the SAP help portal link&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/Security/575a9f0e56f34c6e8138439eefc32b16/616a3c0b1cc748238de9c0341b15c63c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/Security/575a9f0e56f34c6e8138439eefc32b16/616a3c0b1cc748238de9c0341b15c63c.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SS&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2035121"&gt;@Chris1973&lt;/a&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thank you for the response. I checked the languages in both cbc's under the section "scope" and they have both "german" and "english" as languages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I also tried a few things with the language keys in the json file, but with no luck.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If i just change keys for the "original language" i get this error:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-10-13 074244.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326333iB28F182DC6C464C6/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-10-13 074244.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-13 074244.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If i change every key in the file to "en" both for the "original language" and the language" i get this error:&lt;BR /&gt;Which is the opposite of my original error.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-10-13 074317.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326334i90708795C492EB12/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-10-13 074317.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-13 074317.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And if i just change the language keys to "en" and leave the "original language" then i get this error:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-10-13 074427.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326335iB73F76302D05DF45/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-10-13 074427.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-13 074427.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It seems to me like this will be a manual task.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;UPDATE:&lt;BR /&gt;I just noticed that if i change the user language setting from german to english, the pages i created dont have a name and title. So now i added those and exported the pages again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;If i now want to import the page i get the following error:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="LukasKuhn_0-1760340965545.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326499i5E56AECA63131704/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="LukasKuhn_0-1760340965545.png" alt="LukasKuhn_0-1760340965545.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Document splitting in FI documents has long been a topic of discussion, mainly due to its impact on reporting. The approach depends on the specific business scenarios. For example, if reporting is required by ‘Profit Center’, then every line item in the FI document must reflect the corresponding Profit Center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The document splitting characteristics for General Ledger accounting can be maintained at the following path:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance → Accounting and Financial Close → General Ledger Accounting → Business Transaction → Document Splitting → Document Splitting Characteristics for General Ledger Accounting&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This configuration ensures that the document balances to zero at the splitting characteristic level—in this case, the Profit Center. For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cr Vendor &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1000 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EUR &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PC100&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dr Expense Account 1000 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EUR &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PC100&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similarly:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cr Vendor1 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1000 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EUR &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PC100&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cr Vendor2 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1000 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EUR &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PC200&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dr Expense Account 1000 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EUR &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PC100&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dr Expense Account 1000 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;EUR &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PC200&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In both scenarios, although the expense account remains the same, the amounts in the second case are distributed according to the Profit Center assigned to each vendor line item.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These are common scenarios, but there are also additional Document Splitting Characteristics designed for Controlling and for subsequent processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For instance, if the business requires CO reporting at the ‘Internal Order’ or ‘WBS Element’ level and wants each cost element to be posted to the respective IO or WBS, additional document splitting characteristics can be maintained for Controlling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is configured at:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance → Accounting and Financial Close → General Ledger Accounting → Business Transaction → Document Splitting → Document Splitting Characteristics for Controlling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="anjum0691_0-1760326833960.png" style="width: 509px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326247i03099E3246FF939D/image-dimensions/509x131?v=v2" width="509" height="131" role="button" title="anjum0691_0-1760326833960.png" alt="anjum0691_0-1760326833960.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The system can split line items in processes such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Clearing of Vendor/Customer Items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cash Discount Paid&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cash Discount Received&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lost Cash Discount&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Clearing Open Items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Realized Exchange Rate Differences&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Foreign Currency Valuation for Open Items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Expenses/Profit from Foreign Currency Valuation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Flat-rate Individual Value Adjustment for Vendor/Customer Items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Expenses/Profit from Individual Value Adjustment&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, in clearing open items:&lt;BR /&gt;A vendor invoice inherits an Internal Order (IO) from its Purchase Order (PO).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="anjum0691_1-1760326856188.png" style="width: 537px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326248i7CA50A20EF5A42CC/image-dimensions/537x220?v=v2" width="537" height="220" role="button" title="anjum0691_1-1760326856188.png" alt="anjum0691_1-1760326856188.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the vendor payment is processed, the system automatically assigns this IO number to the FX realized gain account (cost element) in the payment document.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="anjum0691_2-1760326871526.png" style="width: 554px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326249i2561BDEE6E72D755/image-dimensions/554x230?v=v2" width="554" height="230" role="button" title="anjum0691_2-1760326871526.png" alt="anjum0691_2-1760326871526.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;(*above screenshots are just for reference purpose and has no relation with the real-time projects)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the time of posting the invoice, the document is split on vendor line items based on the Profit Center (the document splitting characteristic at the GL level). When posting vendor payments, the line item for the realized gain is further split based on the inherited cost object—i.e., the Internal Order from the invoice.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;From my perspective, effective sizing is one of the most underestimated yet critical aspects of any SAP transformation. While SAP offers a standardized and well-defined architecture, every customer’s landscape, data footprint, and performance expectations are unique. This makes it essential for customers and their implementation partners to take ownership of sizing, validation, and optimization activities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For SAP customers, partners, and technical teams navigating the shift to &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt; and other solutions within &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud ERP Private&lt;/STRONG&gt;, accurate system sizing is paramount. While SAP provides a globally consistent, standardized architecture, the responsibility for executing and validating sizing activities rests squarely with the &lt;STRONG&gt;customer and their implementation partners&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ultimately, accurate sizing isn’t just a technical exercise; it’s a strategic enabler for stability, scalability, and long-term cost efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This guide demystifies SAP sizing, focusing on the core concepts, benefits, and practical methods within the SAP Cloud ERP Private landscape.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1631813447"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is SAP Cloud ERP Private?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud ERP Private&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a cloud-based offering that marries the control of an on-premise system with the agility and efficiency of the cloud. It guides customers toward a &lt;STRONG&gt;clean core&lt;/STRONG&gt; through standardized processes and modern extensibility via SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), and in-app extensibility tools.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I think the biggest advantage of running SAP on certified cloud infrastructure that &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud ERP Private &lt;/STRONG&gt;oferring adheres to is how it&amp;nbsp;simplifies everything — security, compliance, and support are all built in. It lets IT teams spend less time keeping the lights on and more time driving innovation. The key, though, is being ready to fully embrace the cloud mindset to get the most out of it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information please refer to&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/understanding-the-distinct-scope-of-sap-cloud-erp-private/ba-p/14219721" target="_blank"&gt;Understanding the Distinct Scope of SAP Cloud ERP Private&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1435299942"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;General SAP Sizing Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP sizing&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the process of precisely determining the required hardware resources such as CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity to effectively support an SAP system based on specific business needs. It’s a blend of science, utilizing tools and calculations, and expert judgment to account for the unique context of each implementation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key aspects of sizing include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Translating Business Requirements:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Starting with user counts, transaction volumes, data growth, and performance expectations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hardware Determination:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Calculating the required compute, memory, and storage.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Iterative Process:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Sizing isn't a one-time event. It must be revisited as the business and technology evolve. This is because sizing relies on assumptions and approximations about future usage, and it must balance optimal performance with cost management.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Quality is Critical:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The accuracy of the sizing results is heavily dependent on the quality of the validated usage data and sizing assumptions provided by customers and partners.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1238786437"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud ERP Private Sizing Strategy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sizing for SAP Cloud ERP Private is a vital step to ensure your infrastructure efficiently supports your SAP workloads. SAP offers two primary models:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standard Sizing:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A simplified, consumption-based model using predefined &lt;STRONG&gt;T-shirt size service bundles&lt;/STRONG&gt; (e.g., XXS to 4XL), which provides a baseline scope with a minimal sizing effort.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tailored Sizing:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A more granular, customized approach for complex landscapes, offering greater flexibility based on detailed requirements.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Sizing Steps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A structured approach to sizing includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Define the Scope:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Identify the SAP applications (e.g., SAP S/4HANA, SAP BW/4HANA) and specific modules, determine transaction workloads, and define usage (e.g., Production, QA).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Collect Baseline Data:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Use tools like the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Quick Sizer&lt;/STRONG&gt; for new systems or &lt;STRONG&gt;EarlyWatch Reports&lt;/STRONG&gt; and historical data (&lt;STRONG&gt;ST03N / ST06&lt;/STRONG&gt;) for existing ones.

You input future metrics like the number of users by type, sales order volumes, and financial transaction counts. The Quick Sizer outputs estimates for SAP HANA memory, CPU cores, and disk sizes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reduced Data Footprint:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Greenfield often means &lt;STRONG&gt;selective data migration&lt;/STRONG&gt; (e.g., only the last 2–3 years of transactional history). This results in a smaller initial database, lower storage requirements, and reduced initial RAM needs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cleaner Architecture:&lt;/STRONG&gt; With fewer customizations and a focus on standard SAP S/4HANA processes, sizing for application performance is more predictable.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Add a Growth Buffer:&lt;/STRONG&gt; As with any new implementation, add a significant buffer (typically &lt;STRONG&gt;~20–30%&lt;/STRONG&gt;) to account for future data growth, unforeseen business process changes, or new functionality adoption.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-143015473"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Brownfield Sizing: Converting the Past to the Future&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use Case:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Converting an existing SAP ECC or SAP S/4HANA system to the private cloud, retaining existing processes and full data history.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Considerations:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Historical Data Analysis is Key:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Sizing is &lt;STRONG&gt;usage-based&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1990116"&gt;@SarahAlbrecht&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As you mentioned, the generic OData and HTTP connectors cannot be used to retrieve data from REST services. To achieve this, you need an additional service such as SAP BTP, a SAP Open Connectors integration (where you can create a REST API connection), or a similar solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi, need help with data action code where we have to divide amount based on two different cross sections. So in cross-section 1 we have the data at a "wave" and "Region" level. In cross section 2 we have the data aggregated at a "wave" level. , so my desired output shall be to get the proportion of each "Region" in a "Wave". As for example if there are 10 regions under a wave, the DA should give me output in Region1/Wave1, Region2/Wave1 and so on. Attaching the excel with the cross sections of dataset.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="674"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="94"&gt;cross section 1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="36"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="53"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="58"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="21"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="66"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="114"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="64"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Artificial Intelligence is transforming how we design and extend SAP applications. Many SAP professionals are now exploring how to start working with AI inside the SAP ecosystem.&lt;BR /&gt;In this post, I share my hands-on experience with SAP AI Core, from my first steps to building a real Proof of Concept (POC) using low-code tools like Build Apps and BPA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Since May, I’ve been working on a POC with SAP AI Core. At that time, I knew nothing about AI. Step by step, by practicing with the examples and samples provided by SAP, I managed to build several POCs integrating SAP AI Core with low-code tools.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;The main objective is simple: accelerate development cycles and innovate with custom applications. On my roadmap, I focused on using low-code solutions like SAP Build Apps and Process Automation (BPA), while integrating AI agents to speed up processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Maybe in a future post I will share more details about the POCs I realized. But today, my first goal is to encourage SAP technical consultants to start this journey.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;As a Senior SAP Technical Consultant, I realized that integrating an AI agent for a first POC or when consuming partner models does not require brand-new skills. But if the objective is to build and train your own model, then of course new competences are needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;With SAP AI Core, we can easily integrate partner models (like Azure OpenAI, ChatGPT, etc.) through APIs. For most SAP technical profiles, it’s enough to follow a simple end-to-end example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select a partner model (text, image, etc.) in SAP AI Launchpad&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Deploy it and get the URL&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Configure the destination and start consuming your AI agent&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Another option in SAP AI Launchpad is the Prompt Editor, which lets you create your own prompts on top of partner models. The key point here is security: your data is not stored in the model — it’s managed securely by SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;This means that integrating external AI agents is feasible without heavy upskilling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;But in my opinion, the real power of SAP AI Core comes when you train your own models. Of course, this requires upskilling in new environments and languages. The key here is HANA Vector combined with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Together, they enable customers to enrich their knowledge databases and build custom agents that are more efficient, optimized, and deliver a brilliant user experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;I believe that SAP AI Core will become a central part of the future SAP landscape, enabling faster innovation and smarter business processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences with SAP AI Core. Have you already built a POC or started exploring it?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integration scenarios require frequent data communication and exchange between different applications and environments. Cloud data platforms such as Snowflake provide efficient data storage and analytics. Snowflake Adapter for SAP Integration Suite is a great tool to solve your integration problems while offering a reliable and scalable capability for data-related integrations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;Snowflake Adapter in SAP CI&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Snowflake Adapters can be used to implement various data solutions, a few of them are as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Transaction Analysis for retail business : Seamlessly load high-volume transactional data into Snowflake to analyze buying behavior, sales trends, and inventory performance enabling smarter business decisions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data Archival &amp;amp; Historical Analysis : Adapter can be used Move large datasets into Snowflake for secure storage and long-term trend analysis without impacting operational systems.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supply Chain Data : Integrate logistics, ERP, and vendor data into Snowflake to monitor supply chain efficiency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this, in the following sections, we will explore the key functionalities and features of the adapter in detail.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Snowflake adapter is designed to be employed as a receiver adapter. In such a scenario, SAP Cloud Integration acts as the initiator of the calls. The adapter uses database authentication and JDBC as the transport protocol.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can perform various CRUD operations on your Snowflake application and choose from a list of different staging storage options, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Microsoft Azure. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below is the high-level overview of how the adapter interacting with Snowflake Application and SAP Cloud Integration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="pulkit_bhatnagar_0-1759233529958.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321571iE6A3EE3093162FEB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="pulkit_bhatnagar_0-1759233529958.png" alt="pulkit_bhatnagar_0-1759233529958.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Features&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Snowflake Adapter provides the following key features:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Bulk Export and Import:&amp;nbsp;Supports reading files from multiple input formats like CSV, JSON, and Avro. Export data to your desired format using unload operation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Snowflake Operations Support:&amp;nbsp;Snowflake Adapter offers support for standard Snowflake operations (CRUD Operations).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Multiple options for Staging Storage:&amp;nbsp;Snowflake Adapter provides various options to load data into staging storage like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Secure Authentication:&amp;nbsp;Provides secure authentication with Database Account and&lt;BR /&gt;Key-Pair options.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Snowflake Adapter Integration: Practical Use Case Walkthrough&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Imagine a business scenario where 1 million records from an ERP system need to be loaded into Snowflake. If we take the straightforward route of simply fetching the data from ERP and pushing it into Snowflake, the process could drag on for several minutes. But what if we could speed things up dramatically?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By smartly combining a set of Integration Suite palettes with the Snowflake adapter, I have built a custom batch processing mechanism with which, the same operation can be completed in just a matter of seconds—delivering both speed and efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I’ll Walk you through how to handle such high-volume data insertion with the Snowflake adapter, and we’ll also take a look at how the execution unfolds inside Snowflake itself.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Before we begin, let us assume that a table is available in Snowflake with the required schema.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CI iflow Design&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="pulkit_bhatnagar_2-1759233617842.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321573iE938B5A5B9A9218D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="pulkit_bhatnagar_2-1759233617842.png" alt="pulkit_bhatnagar_2-1759233617842.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Mapping Component&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Once the data is received in SAP Integration Suite; the payload will be mapped to required column headers, which are defined in the target table in Snowflake.&amp;nbsp;We employ an iterating splitter to split the records into groups (defined in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Grouping&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;field) and then insert the records in Snowflake.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Splitter Component:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using the Iterating Splitter, you can enable the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Streaming&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;checkbox to improve efficiency by splitting a large composite message into smaller chunks for processing.&amp;nbsp;Additionally, you can enable&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Parallel Processing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;of split messages to enhance efficiency. You can specify this by providing value for&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Number of Concurrent Processes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="pulkit_bhatnagar_4-1759233662441.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321575iBAE53A727CB85EBE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="pulkit_bhatnagar_4-1759233662441.png" alt="pulkit_bhatnagar_4-1759233662441.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: You can modify&amp;nbsp;the grouping,&amp;nbsp;utilize&amp;nbsp;parallel processing and&amp;nbsp;adjust the&amp;nbsp;number of concurrent processes&amp;nbsp;based on&amp;nbsp;your&amp;nbsp;requirements.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;XML Modifier Component:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;XML Modifier is used to remove the XML declaration from the XML body to make XML compatible with the snowflake.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="pulkit_bhatnagar_5-1759233691016.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321576i9C9F01E4E81BC1FF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="pulkit_bhatnagar_5-1759233691016.png" alt="pulkit_bhatnagar_5-1759233691016.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Content Modifier Component - Payload for Snowflake Adapter Insert&amp;nbsp;Operation:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Content Modifier is used to store&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;payload to be inserted in the table.

By implementing the optimized iflow design outlined above, the same volume of records is processed and inserted into the Snowflake application within 30–35 seconds, demonstrating a significant improvement in performance and efficiency.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In summary, the Snowflake adapter enables smooth, secure, and scalable integration between cloud applications and Snowflake. The successful insertion of records highlights its efficiency and reliability, positioning it as a key enabler for enterprises looking to modernize their data landscape and leverage Snowflake’s analytics capabilities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;References&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/package/SnowflakeAdapterforSAPIntegrationSuite/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://api.sap.com/package/SnowflakeAdapterforSAPIntegrationSuite/overview&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note: &lt;/STRONG&gt;The Snowflake adapter is available as part of your SAP Integration Suite license.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

In this blog, we can only give an introduction that doesn’t do the full paper justice, so we recommend you read the full guide.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The core idea is to separate strategic planning from the tactical execution of Agentic tasks. This allows better control over the behavior of the agentic systems and increases resilience against errors and misalignment. In the P-t-E pattern, the Planner establishes a plan of steps to meet the user’s instructions. Those instructions are passed one-by-one to an Executor that completes each task with the help of tools and other agents defined in the plan.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1632947297"&gt;Plan-then-Execute&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1565516511"&gt;Planner and Executor&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;What makes the pattern “Plan-then-Execute” is that the Planner creates the workflow to complete the user’s instructions ahead of time, before any other agents, tools, data sources or input are engaged with. The Planner is more likely implemented using a Large Language Model (LLM) with strong reasoning capabilities to interpret the user’s intent and turn it into a concrete set of tasks to be executed to achieve the strategic goal. To be effective, prompts for the Planner must be engineered to produce a task list that the Executor can understand and act on. For instance, include a task description, the tool or agent to invoke, and any other context that the Executor needs to know to execute each subtask.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Executor executes this pre-determined plan one task at the time, invoking the tools APIs or other agents to accomplish each subtask – ideally already specified by the Planner. The level of sophistication may differ by the criticality of the user scenario or agentic AI system. But in general, this means that the Executor can be implemented with a more cost-efficient, smaller, and faster LLM, or even a deterministic code component that directly executes Planner instructions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This pattern has several key benefits. First, it has often been observed that asking an LLM to describe how it breaks down a problem increases the accuracy of its output. By forcing the Planner to think through the entire problem, the LLM is compelled into higher quality of reasoning that leads to higher success rates in completing the task.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Moreover, by preparing the plan ahead of execution, we lock in the sequence of subtasks in the workflow. This makes the execution predictable, and far more resistant to losing sight of the overall objective. Even if an individual agent misbehaves, it is not capable of altering the overall execution plan. The plan can include failure modes on error and require letting the user confirm any critical actions before transactions are committed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, the plan that the Planner produces is a clear statement of intent how the agentic system must execute the user’s intent. That creates evidence that can be used in audits, as well provide a basis to verify that the execution met the objective.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1369003006"&gt;Verifier and Refiner&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The P-t-E paper considers two other components to further enhance the confidence in the planning process. The first is the Verifier. The role of this architectural component is to verify the plan produced by the Planner before it is handed over to the Executor. This extends the model to Plan-Validate-Execute (P-V-E). The Verifier can be an expert in a Human in the Loop (HITL) workflow or automated with another agent or other verification method. The Verifier must have a different implementation than the Planner to avoid the Verifier making the same mistakes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The pattern also accommodates for a Refiner, which fixes errors identified by the Verifier and updates the plan before execution. Again, this could use HITL or be automated – either as a separate model or as a function performed by the Planner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1043406782"&gt;Revisiting the Discount Scenario With P-t-E&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is easier to see how this works when applied to a concrete example. In &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/security-and-compliance-blogs/that-s-not-what-we-agreed-repudiation-and-agentic-ai-threat-modeling/ba-p/14208975" target="_blank"&gt;part 1&lt;/A&gt;, we described a buyer-seller scenario with agents authorized to issue discounts. We quickly ran into Repudiation challenges since the system lacked clear workflow control, ability to establish a shared reality, or resilience to errors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s update the diagram &amp;nbsp;from part 1 with the P-t-E pattern. The Chat Agent is the interface to the Buyer and passes the user’s instruction as part of the prompt to the Planner (after sensible input sanitation) to prepare an actionable plan for the Executor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Updated diagram of the Discount agentic AI system from part 1 with the Plan-then-Execute pattern, including a Planner and Executor providing greater resilience to misalignment and errors" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325300i69051C47ACD1C110/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="JayThvV_0-1760039500132.png" alt="Updated diagram of the Discount agentic AI system from part 1 with the Plan-then-Execute pattern, including a Planner and Executor providing greater resilience to misalignment and errors" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Updated diagram of the Discount agentic AI system from part 1 with the Plan-then-Execute pattern, including a Planner and Executor providing greater resilience to misalignment and errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Conceivably, the plan looks like this for our example scenario:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Look up widgets in the catalog and check price, stock levels and delivery timelines for 15,000 widgets; use the Seller Agent with read-only privileges&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Return to the Buyer in case the conditions can’t be met and propose whether we should look for alternatives, or the Buyer can adjust the terms. Otherwise, present the price and delivery details for confirmation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In case the buyer asks for a discount, invoke the Discount Agent; remind it to not exceed 10%&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Apply the discount and present the new total; repeat until the Buyer agrees or the calculated discount exceeds 10%&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If no agreement can be reached, escalate to a human sales representative.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If agreement is reached, execute the transaction using the Seller Agent, with write access.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This breakdown of subtasks already shows several key elements that increase control over the execution of the overall objective:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A task description, that is, what concrete subtask we want performed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Which agent should fulfill that subtask&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;With what privileges the agent should execute the subtask with&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reminders of system prompts, that is, not to exceed the 10% discount)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;At which critical steps the system must get confirmation from the Buyer (HITL)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to fail gracefully, in this case, by escalating to a human sales representative&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once passed to the Executor it works through the task list, invoking the various agents already defined, with the least privilege to complete the task as discussed in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/security-and-compliance-blogs/limiting-agent-autonomy-least-privilege-and-tool-access-for-agentic-ai/ba-p/14224584" target="_blank"&gt;part 2&lt;/A&gt;, and without their output able to influence the workflow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The paper calls this “Automatic Planning + User-Involved Execution”. In more complex scenarios, it might be beneficial to have the Buyer validate the plan the Planner came up with in a P-V-E check (dotted arrow). This may make sense, for instance, if the agentic AI system includes 3rd-party Seller Agents of varying trust levels.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-975975996"&gt;Fail Gracefully and Recover&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Aside from much greater control over agent behavior, the P-t-E pattern also provides greater resilience to errors, failure and model misalignment if they still occur. Intermediation involving some kind of protocol conversion is often an effective control to fail gracefully or detect bad input or output, rather than a more impactful outcome.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Executor can validate the output or reject it if it doesn’t meet the expected format. The Human in the Loop can verify if mistakes were made in the enforce HITL steps, before an invoice is sent. If the value of a previous step doesn’t make sense in the next subtask, that next task will likely fail, rather than execute a malicious transaction. With the right access controls in the business systems, any unauthorized discount could be rejected at the point of transaction and return an error code rather than send out an incorrect invoice. That error code could allow the Executor to retry with a correction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-650379772"&gt;Additional Control Points&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The P-t-E pattern itself has benefits by-design. But it also allows for additional control points in implementation and operations. For instance, instead of passing in an excessive discount into the business system and hope it catches it, the Executor can check whether the discount returned by the Discount Agent meets the conditions that were set. If the discount exceeds 10%, the Executor can intervene. It can decide to instruct the Discount Agent to try again, to return the maximum allowed discount to the user, or drop into step 5 of the plan and involve a human sales representative.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As we hinted before, the plan provides an audit control point that can be paired with a comparison of the Executor logs to verify&amp;nbsp;the plan’s intent was followed and executed. It provides an interface into Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC), and thus the potential for auditable, compliant agentic AI systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-453866267"&gt;Not a Substitute for Security Basics&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;P-t-E is an architecture design pattern. The paper clearly states that it is not a substitute for generally accepted (AI) security practices in implementation and operations. Regardless how your agentic AI systems are designed, it is still important to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Protect your data and infrastructure&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Secure your build and deployment pipeline&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Train with anonymized data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use RAG with access controls&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Access business systems with Business Connectors with appropriate authorizations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Carefully design your system prompts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/security-and-compliance-blogs/defending-against-ai-security-risks-by-turning-llms-on-llms/ba-p/14032661" target="_blank"&gt;Defend against direct prompt injections attacks, jail breaks, and system prompt leaks&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-foundation-os.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI Foundation&lt;/A&gt; can support you in these areas for your own agentic AI projects and is the platform for SAP AI solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-257352762"&gt;Joule Agents and P-t-E&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule agents follow a proto-pattern similar to P-t-E, using the AppRouter and Scenario Selection to determine what the agent must do. That works well for single agent scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For multi-agent – potentially multi-party – agentic AI systems, we believe that the P-t-E pattern is more appropriate. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08646" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute Implementations&lt;/A&gt; paper mentioned earlier is under review for adoption at SAP of P-t-E as the recommended architecture pattern for agentic AI solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-60839257"&gt;Closing&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this article, we introduced the P-t-E pattern and its architectural benefits in designing secure Agentic systems. We highly recommend to the audience to read the entire research paper for further details. In the next and final part in this series, we will discuss how this pattern defends against misaligned and even deceptive model behavior.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--135674248"&gt;More Information&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08646" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Architecting Resilient LLM Agents: A Guide to Secure Plan-then-Execute Implementations&lt;/A&gt;, Ron F.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Christoph,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I also remember the machine learning 3E thing being mentioned, but as it says in the blog you referenced, it is planned but no official rollout is set. Same can be said for our AI integration for on-premise, it is possible for a 2025 feature pack, but not promised right now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cheers,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Michael&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2253554"&gt;@JackN11&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The reason it happens is because your custom logic overrides the standard bin determination that performs capacity check. You can fix this and keep the enhancement you introduced by:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In your BAdI implementation, ensure to call the standard bin determination logic, this will ensure that the system still executes the automatic split routine.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensure you verify if your BAdI filter values are limited to the relevant storage types only.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The following reference will provide some details:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-q-a/regarding-badi-scwm-ex-core-pts-nbin-nrm-for-multiple-wt-putaway-into-same/qaq-p/427878" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-q-a/regarding-badi-scwm-ex-core-pts-nbin-nrm-for-multiple-wt-putaway-into-same/qaq-p/427878&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-q-a/regarding-to-badi-scwm-ex-core-pts-nbin-nrm-to-allow-mixed-storage-doesn-t/qaq-p/14158730" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-q-a/regarding-to-badi-scwm-ex-core-pts-nbin-nrm-to-allow-mixed-storage-doesn-t/qaq-p/14158730&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In this blog post, I would like to provide a step-by-step guide on how to configure and integrate the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition with SAP S/4HANA Cloud to electronically submit the VAT Return to the tax authorities. This blog will specifically cover the setup and configuration of the VAT return for the United Kingdom (GB) – a list of some other statutory reports and countries supported by SAP Document and Reporting Compliance can be found&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4de200b26d5d42bbacae69c6bf6b9923/3313cc00d6914502b3caabd864e0c362.html?q=vat%20return" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The value of the integration between SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition lies in the fact that one simply needs to setup the various steps shown below one time initially – once this is done, a single click to submit the report from SAP S/4HANA Cloud triggers the entire flow so that that the tax authority, HMRC, automatically receives the VAT return.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the configuration/set up required for GB VAT Return, please refer to refer to this blog for details based on your SAP S/4HANA release: &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/financial-management-blog-posts-by-sap/setup-communication-of-sap-document-and-reporting-compliance-cloud-edition/ba-p/14237600" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/financial-management-blog-posts-by-sap/setup-communication-of-sap-document-and-reporting-compliance-cloud-edition/ba-p/14237600&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;END-TO-END PROCESS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once all the set-up and configuration has been completed, we can then run through the process of generating and submitting a GB VAT Return to HMRC&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[1] Open the Run Statutory Reports FIORI app and enter the following parameters:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reporting Entity&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Report Name: GB_VAT_DCL&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reporting Year&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sam_Karbani_0-1760088508723.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325489i5C36A28DD6119151/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Sam_Karbani_0-1760088508723.png" alt="Sam_Karbani_0-1760088508723.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sam_Karbani_1-1760088562390.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325488i6507AE8A1FC84708/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Sam_Karbani_1-1760088562390.png" alt="Sam_Karbani_1-1760088562390.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[2] After running and completing the activities listed, for example, Manage Tax Items, select the activity GB VAT Return Statement:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sam_Karbani_11-1760088670107.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325501iD79820E5152D8FA3/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Sam_Karbani_11-1760088670107.png" alt="Sam_Karbani_11-1760088670107.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[3] Select New Run, check the defaulted selection criteria and make changes if required:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sam_Karbani_3-1760088631112.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325492i9248F677699B2BE2/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Sam_Karbani_3-1760088631112.png" alt="Sam_Karbani_3-1760088631112.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[4] After executing the report and checking the VAT return statement click on&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sam_Karbani_4-1760088631112.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325493i35CC516A65E7D8C2/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Sam_Karbani_4-1760088631112.png" alt="Sam_Karbani_4-1760088631112.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since the GB VAT Return process uses OAuth 2.0 and Authorization Code Flow, eliminating the need to maintain a username and password, only the VAT registration number and authorization code need to be maintained.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;MAINTAINING CREDENTIALS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you're VAT-registered, HMRC now &lt;STRONG&gt;automatically signs up&lt;/STRONG&gt; new businesses for MTD for VAT unless you're exempt or have applied for exemption. Here's what you need to do:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use compatible software&lt;/STRONG&gt;: You must keep digital VAT records and submit VAT returns using MTD-compatible software. SAP S/4HANA provides the end-to-end process of recording your financial transactions, generating the VAT return and submitting the report electronically using the mandated API from HMRC in the correct JSON file format.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sign in with your Government Gateway ID&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This is your credential for accessing HMRC services. If you don’t have one, you can create a Government Gateway account: &lt;A href="https://www.gov.uk/log-in-register-hmrc-online-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;create a Government Gateway account&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Link your software to HMRC&lt;/STRONG&gt;: SAP Document and Reporting Compliance will guide you through authorizing it to communicate with HMRC using your Government Gateway credentials.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To maintain your credentials for UK MTD, please go to the BTP app Manage Communication to External Parties. For UK MTD, this is your VAT registration number.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;INITIAL AUTHORISATION&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For the first submission, you will be prompted to enter your credentials in the HMRC portal. You will see a message asking if the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition is authorized to access the HMRC portal. Please select "Yes" to generate and save a token in the Integration component in BTP for 18 months.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SUBSEQUENT SUBMISSIONS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For 18 months after the initial authorization, you will not need to enter a username and password for submissions. The GB_VAT_DCL report will be submitted as soon as the user selects the Submit button in the Fiori app Run Statutory Reports.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The access tokens need to be renewed every 18 months.&amp;nbsp; If the access tokens are not valid, at the time of submission, the user will be redirected to HMRC to renew the access tokens before submission can take place&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;TROUBLESHOOTING:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[1] If you are transitioning from SAP Document and Reporting Compliance service to SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition and are now moving to SAP Document you can find more information &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SLH_advanced_compliance_reporting_service/7a60944343e543a1ab99e9b2904dab09/783265ef58da41fa8bd8f5a8f0f1732a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You will need to apply all referred notes and pre-requisites of SAP note: &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3386362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3386362 - UK VAT Return Submission: Implementation Overview - SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further information is also available in our FAQ in the &lt;EM&gt;generic questions section&lt;/EM&gt; of the Migration Guide (can be used as reference):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SLH_advanced_compliance_reporting_service/7a60944343e543a1ab99e9b2904dab09/7ce724ae2cbb454aa2b1c900bcacc0d2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SLH_advanced_compliance_reporting_service/7a60944343e543a1ab99e9b2904dab09/7ce724ae2cbb454aa2b1c900bcacc0d2.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[2] To enforce a new re-direction:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Go to Communication Settings App (BTP-SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search per your Identification number and click on the entry:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sam_Karbani_5-1760088631115.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325495i6E6FEE45FAD345AA/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Sam_Karbani_5-1760088631115.png" alt="Sam_Karbani_5-1760088631115.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3.

You may now resubmit your report from SAP S/4HANA Run Statutory Reports, and a redirection to HMRC should be enforced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; a.&amp;nbsp; Please wait few mins (˜5 mins) before resubmitting the report (this should allow any cached items to be erased).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hopefully, this blog post gave you a detailed walkthrough of the steps needed to setup and configure the automatic electronic submission of the UK VAT Return. With this one-time setup, the users can benefit from a seamless integration between SAP S/4HANA Cloud and the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

You did not mention where will you store the results of the calculation, a different audittrail or different measure. I assumed it as different audittrail CALC.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Adjust your dimension name and add more membersets to scope as per your data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;MEMBERSET [d/AuditTrail]="PARA"
MEMBERSET [d/Measure]="Amount"

DATA([d/AuditTrail]="CALC")=RESULTLOOKUP()/RESULTLOOKUP([d/Region]="#")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope this helps !!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nikhil&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While creating a CDS View for outputting text elements, I stumbled upon an interesting behavior. To put it simply, I have the following string from an SAP text element:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;'The limit for customer &amp;amp;1 was exceeded by &amp;amp;2 &amp;amp;3 at &amp;amp;4'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;I apply the replace function four times to replace the string &amp;amp;1, &amp;amp;2, &amp;amp;3 and &amp;amp;4 with the following values:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;value1 = '123456'
value2 = '100.00'
value3 = 'EUR'
value4 = '13.10.2015'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cast(replace(cast(replace(cast(replace(cast(replace(Text, '&amp;amp;1', cast(value1 as abap.char(20))) abap.char(73)), '&amp;amp;2', cast(value2 as abap.char(20))) as abap.char(73)), cast('&amp;amp;3' as abap.sstring(50)), cast(value3 as abap.char(20))) as abap.char(76)),'&amp;amp;4', cast(value4 as abap.char(20))) as abap.char(76)) as MessageText&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This logic works fine for &amp;amp;1, &amp;amp;2 and &amp;amp;4, while &amp;amp;3 is simply not replaced, regardless of the target value that is inserted. This results in the following string:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;'The limit for customer 123456 was exceeded by 100.00 &amp;amp;3 at 13.10.2025'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Has anyone else encountered this error, or is there a better way to output text elements in CDS?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;BR,&lt;BR /&gt;Lukas&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Have you ever faced duplicate rows when fetching entry comments from Concur via Cognos? If so, here is the solution to fix and retrieve it in a single row.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reason: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Duplicate rows in Cognos reports on comments often arise because of the one-to-many relationship between expense reports and its comments. Since each comment is treated as a distinct record, the primary expense report is repeated for each comment linked to it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution: &lt;/STRONG&gt;To fetch entry comments from Concur via Cognos report without creating duplicate records, we must use a method that merges comments into a single field and here are the steps that we need to follow:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Step 1: On the SAP Concur home page click &lt;STRONG&gt;Home&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Applications &amp;gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Reporting &amp;gt; Intelligence.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SwapnaS19_0-1760336088838.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326350i5F10EC82C033A0BD/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SwapnaS19_0-1760336088838.png" alt="SwapnaS19_0-1760336088838.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In Concur Reporting tool, click on &lt;STRONG&gt;New&amp;gt; Report &lt;/STRONG&gt;from four horizontal lines available at top left corner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SwapnaS19_1-1760336166274.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326354iB93C4EF978AF728E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SwapnaS19_1-1760336166274.png" alt="SwapnaS19_1-1760336166274.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Select &lt;STRONG&gt;Blank &lt;/STRONG&gt;template and click on &lt;STRONG&gt;Create&lt;/STRONG&gt; button from the top right corner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SwapnaS19_2-1760336179643.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326355i9C198F7E05163B0A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SwapnaS19_2-1760336179643.png" alt="SwapnaS19_2-1760336179643.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4:&lt;/STRONG&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;When a specific account is used, the profit center in the coding block keeps being set to 9999.&lt;BR /&gt;Although a different profit center (not 9999) is assigned in 3KEI, the system ignores it and still assigns 9999.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;When I debugged the process, I found that the function COBL_CODINGBLOCK_CHECK sets the profit center to 9999.&lt;BR /&gt;Could you tell me where in this function the profit center value is determined or assigned?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As far as I know, consolidation in SAP Group Reporting is done independently for each group or subgroup for which you perform it, but my question is, would it be possible to do a cascade consolidation?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind Regards.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2253554"&gt;@JackN11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Just to summarise, there is no single Track Down Payment app in the public cloud. You can instead use a combination of Finance and Procurement apps for that. You can approach by:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Displaying Supplier Down Payment Requests: track down payment requests linked to POs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage Supplier Line Items: here you can view down payment postings.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Monitor Purchase Order Items: this helps you to see down payment and payment status at PO level.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Display Supplier Balances: &amp;nbsp;You can verify those balances including your down payments.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Have a look at the following links for more guidance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0e602d466b99490187fcbb30d1dc897c/6fb104f9b69241118a1ca76f7d4550bf.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0e602d466b99490187fcbb30d1dc897c/6fb104f9b69241118a1ca76f7d4550bf.html?locale=en-US&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/918bca53037f408f91a2295d04ac16bc/0627d253913e4608e10000000a174cb4.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/918bca53037f408f91a2295d04ac16bc/0627d253913e4608e10000000a174cb4.html?locale=en-US&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Whilst doing that, ensure&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;that your scope item for supplier down payments is active and that your PO payment terms contain the down payment indicator.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;InnerSource is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;practice of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;applying Open Source methodologies, culture and best practices to in-house software development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although still unknown by many, the practice counts with a big community in the tech industry, supported by the &lt;A href="https://innersourcecommons.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;InnerSource Commons&lt;/A&gt; foundation. How big? So big that this year the InnerSource Summit, which is the main event for this topic, will be hosted by three companies, across three different continents, providing nearly 24 hours of content!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this post we will talk about what InnerSource is, where to find its community, the largest event for the topic, and how to be part of it!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TL;DR&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Join &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Mitsubishi Electric&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and/or &lt;STRONG&gt;IBM&lt;/STRONG&gt; in &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":germany:"&gt;🇩🇪&lt;/span&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Berlin&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":japan:"&gt;🇯🇵&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Yokohama&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":united_states:"&gt;🇺🇸&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;New York&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;or &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":globe_with_meridians:"&gt;🌐&lt;/span&gt; online on &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":spiral_calendar:"&gt;🗓&lt;/span&gt;️&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;November 13&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;InnerSource Summit 2025&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1633601586"&gt;What is InnerSource?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Have you ever had a great experience with an open source project? I mean, not just a great experience using what the project delivers, but something that goes beyond that, like find a welcoming invite and joining the project's community, or easily finding you could contribute and sending a pull request that got accepted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine if we could replicate that experience inside our companies!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is what InnerSource is, making closed-source projects great, by applying in them the learnings from successful open source projects, and steering the company culture towards openness, transparency and collaboration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sounds simple, right? Well, yeah, the idea is simple, but &lt;STRONG&gt;making open source and InnerSource projects &lt;EM&gt;great&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;is more than just having the source code in a git repository somewhere&lt;/STRONG&gt;. That's why the practice has a name and also a community around it to document and share the best practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1437088081"&gt;Who's doing InnerSource?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;A lot of people still haven't heard about InnerSource and they would probably be surprised by how mature the topic is. I mean, sure, many companies are still on their early days in adopting the practice, it is a marathon, not a sprint. Nevertheless, &lt;A href="https://innersourcecommons.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;InnerSource Commons&lt;/A&gt;, a large cross-industry community for the topic, was established already 10 years ago (which we are celebrating in our event, by the way), and incorporated as a foundation in 2020.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Among the &lt;A href="https://innersourcecommons.org/stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;companies who already talked publicly about InnerSource&lt;/A&gt; you will find big names, such as &lt;STRONG&gt;Bosch&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;BBC&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;IBM&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;PayPal&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;and, of course &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP is an active member of the InnerSource (Commons) community, and that's one of the reasons why we are co-hosting the InnerSource Summit in Berlin this year!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1240574576"&gt;The InnerSource Summit&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The InnerSource summit is an yearly (sometimes bi-yearly) event organized by InnerSource Commons since as early as 2016, where experts and interested parties come together to share their knowledge, learn from each other, recharge their InnerSource batteries and expand their network.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This year we will have the event onsite for the first time since 2019 (as it has been running virtually since 2020), and it is coming back with bang!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To celebrate the 10th year of InnerSource Commons, the event will take place not only online, but it will follow the sun onsite across three different locations (on three different continents!), and will be co-hosted by three different companies!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It will start in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":japan:"&gt;🇯🇵&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Yokohama&lt;/STRONG&gt;, hosted by&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mistsubishi Electric&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&amp;nbsp;which will be followed by&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;hosting it in&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":germany:"&gt;🇩🇪&lt;/span&gt;Berlin&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and finally it will end in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":united_states:"&gt;🇺🇸&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;New York&lt;/STRONG&gt;, hosted by &lt;STRONG&gt;IBM&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our leg, &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-giese/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Peter Giese&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Director of the SAP Open Source Program Office&lt;/STRONG&gt;, will get things started with the &lt;STRONG&gt;keynote&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;"From Code to Culture: Scaling Collaboration with InnerSource"&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and will be followed by fifteen speakers with topics including the state of InnerSource in the industry, open communication, adoption stories, implementation of InnerSource analytics, usage of AI for cross-team collaboration, and more!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1044061071"&gt;Join us!&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Did I catch your interest in learning more about InnerSource ad meeting its community?

    <content>Thank you for answer. I hoped that since ODN is a new solution, it will be supported in the same way as "custom fields and logic" extensions are, for some of data - new fields will be added to migration object automatically.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I haven’t received the popup for transitioning to Universal ID yet. Should I just wait until it appears during login, or is there a link or site where I can take action proactively? I’d appreciate any guidance you can provide.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Migrating SAP Profile and Microservices to SAP BTP Kyma</title>

    <content>&lt;P data-start="805" data-end="1111" data-unlink="true"&gt;Over the past months, our SAP Community Portal team took on one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in recent years: migrating the &lt;A href="https://profile.sap.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Profile&lt;/A&gt; and&amp;nbsp;the supporting microservices of the&amp;nbsp;SAP Community&amp;nbsp;Platform from &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/what-is-sap-btp-neo-environment?locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP Neo&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/exploring-sap-converged-cloud" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Converged Cloud (Kubernikus)&lt;/A&gt; to &lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/developing-applications-in-sap-btp-kyma-runtime" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP Kyma Runtime&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P data-start="1113" data-end="1331"&gt;This was more than a technical migration: We wanted to strengthen our platform for the long term, simplify operations, and empower the team with modern cloud-native tools and practices.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H2 data-start="1113" data-end="1331" id="toc-hId-1761937604"&gt;Motivation&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P data-start="1113" data-end="1331"&gt;Over time, our platform had grown across multiple environments — SAP BTP Neo and SAP Converged Cloud (Kubernikus) — each with its own operational footprint and limitations. To continue evolving the SAP Community and SAP Profile, we needed a foundation that was both modern and sustainable.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P data-start="644" data-end="667"&gt;Our goals were clear:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL data-start="668" data-end="985"&gt;
&lt;LI data-start="668" data-end="774"&gt;
&lt;P data-start="670" data-end="774"&gt;Increase development speed and efficiency through improved tooling, automation, and infrastructure&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI data-start="775" data-end="897"&gt;
&lt;P data-start="777" data-end="897"&gt;Reduce operational costs and complexity by adopting SaaS-managed databases and retiring legacy Neo Global Accounts&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI data-start="898" data-end="985"&gt;
&lt;P data-start="900" data-end="985"&gt;Address security and maintenance risks tied to the aging Kubernikus environment&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;H2 data-start="987" data-end="1205" id="toc-hId-1565424099"&gt;Solution&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P data-start="987" data-end="1205"&gt;To achieve this, we migrated a suite of critical services, including the Avatar Service, Subscription Service, Session Service, and Khoros Firehose Integration, to &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/kyma-environment?locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP Kyma Runtime&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;BR data-start="2001" data-end="2004" /&gt;We also switched to &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/postgresql-on-sap-btp-hyperscaler-option.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP PostgreSQL&lt;/A&gt;, introduced &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/choose-backend-for-kyma-eventing" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;NATS&lt;/A&gt; for messaging, and integrated everything into Hyperspace build pipelines for streamlined CI/CD.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P data-start="2167" data-end="2446"&gt;The transition required close collaboration between development, operations, and architecture teams. Careful planning, extensive testing, and phased rollouts helped ensure that users experienced no disruptions — even as we moved the foundation of the platform beneath their feet.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H2 data-start="2933" data-end="2955" id="toc-hId-1368910594"&gt;SAP runs SAP&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P data-start="2956" data-end="3282"&gt;This migration is part of SAP’s broader transformation journey - applying our own cloud technologies internally and learning from the experience. By moving our services to SAP BTP Kyma, we’re contributing to SAP’s “Run SAP on SAP” strategy and setting the stage for continued innovation in the years ahead.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To achieve this, we migrated a suite of critical services, including the Avatar Service, Subscription Service, Session Service, and Khoros Firehose Integration&amp;nbsp;to SAP BTP Kyma Runtime. We also switched to BTP PostgreSQL, introduced NATS for messaging, and integrated everything into Hyperspace build pipelines for streamlined CI/CD.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Special thanks to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5"&gt;@weckerle&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3"&gt;@aliona_boltromeyuk&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/652923"&gt;@hyerimm&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/43130"&gt;@irene-glaz&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/40968"&gt;@erikdietz284&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as well as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6"&gt;@MirkoFriedrich&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/607"&gt;@yaniv&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for leading this effort and to all consultants who contributed their expertise throughout the migration.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In many SAP reports, we build &lt;STRONG&gt;ALV outputs&lt;/STRONG&gt; and allow the user to select certain rows for further processing.&lt;BR /&gt;A common approach is to add a custom &lt;STRONG&gt;checkbox column&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the field catalog and capture user-selected rows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But did you know?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;ALV itself provides a &lt;STRONG&gt;built-in line selection mechanism&lt;/STRONG&gt; — no need for extra checkbox fields.&lt;BR /&gt;This makes your report look cleaner and behave more like &lt;STRONG&gt;standard SAP transactions&lt;/STRONG&gt; (e.g., ME2N, ME23N).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this post, I’ll share how to enable &lt;STRONG&gt;row selection&lt;/STRONG&gt; both in &lt;STRONG&gt;OOPs ALV (CL_GUI_ALV_GRID)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Classical ALV (REUSE_ALV_GRID_DISPLAY)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, along with the benefits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1761041053"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#003366"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OOPs ALV with Container (CL_GUI_ALV_GRID):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#003366"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;Enable Line Selection&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DATA: ls_layout TYPE lvc_s_layo.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Gurus,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;i wanna to share with you today a dilemma topics regarding SAP migration onto the Cloud. The question today isn't if you should move your SAP landscape to the cloud or not, but &lt;STRONG&gt;HOW?&lt;/STRONG&gt; to do it strategically and efficiently.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your SAP system is the backbone of your business; your finance, your supply chain, your core data. Moving it is a journey that requires expertise, precision, strong methodology and partnership.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1762030108"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Migration Approaches&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;6Rs migration strategy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;helps you understand and prioritize portfolio and application discovery, planning, change management, and the technical processes involved in migrating your SAP system to the cloud. The 6 Rs represent six strategies listed in the following table that help you plan for your application migrations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="174"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;R strategy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="402"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methodology&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="174"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rehosting&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="402"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application is migrated as is to AWS. This is also called a "lift-and-shift" approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="174"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Re-platforming&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="402"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application is changed or transformed in some aspect as part of its migration to AWS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="174"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Repurchasing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="402"&gt;&lt;P&gt;You move to a different application or solution on the cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="174"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Refactoring / Re‑architecting&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="402"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application is redesigned (for example, it’s converted from a monolithic architecture to microservices) as part of the migration to AWS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="174"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Retiring&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="402"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application is retired during migration to AWS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="174"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Retaining&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="402"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application isn’t migrated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The decision tree diagram helps you visualize the end-to-end process, starting from application discovery and moving through each 6 R strategy.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="migrating-hana-6rs.png" style="width: 819px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325304iC6DFD2EADEA2B5BC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="migrating-hana-6rs.png" alt="migrating-hana-6rs.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;The three strategies that are specifically applicable for SAP migrations to cloud are &lt;STRONG&gt;Rehosting,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Re-platforming &lt;/STRONG&gt;and&lt;STRONG&gt; Re-Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Rehosting is applicable when you want to move your SAP system AS-IS to the cloud hosting. This type of migration involves minimal change and can be seen as a natural fit for customers who are already running some sort of SAP systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Re-platforming is applicable when you want to migrate from an&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;anyDB&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;source database (such as IBM DB2, Oracle Database, or SQL Server) to an &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt; database.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Re-Architect (or Transform)&amp;nbsp;This is the most transformative path. This includes two major scenarios:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Greenfield:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A clean slate implementation of S/4HANA directly on cloud hosting. This is for complete process redesign.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Brownfield:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Where you upgrade your existing SAP ECC system to S/4HANA while migrating it to AWS. This keeps your historical data and existing business processes, but modernized.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1565516603"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Business Imperative&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beyond Infrastructure&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;So why are thousands of companies migrating their mission-critical SAP systems to the cloud? It goes far beyond simply replacing a data center. It's about achieving four core business outcomes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost &amp;amp; TCO Reduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt; By shifting to the cloud offerings like pay-as-you-go model, you eliminate the crippling cycle of hardware refreshes. You can easily right-size environments, utilize reserved instances for deep discounts, and drastically reduce your &lt;STRONG&gt;Total Cost of Ownership&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agility &amp;amp; Innovation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is where the magic happens. Moving SAP onto cloud gives you immediate access to other cloud services like AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and Advanced Analytics. This allows you to rapidly innovate on top of your core SAP data in ways that were impossible on-premise.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Performance &amp;amp; Scalability:&lt;/STRONG&gt; cloud hosting usually offers the largest, most powerful certified instances for SAP ERP. This means faster reports, quicker transaction processing, and the ability to instantly scale up for month-end closes or peak demand periods, and then scale back down to save cost.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security &amp;amp; Resilience: &lt;/STRONG&gt;all cloud hosting providers, provides a foundational security layer that is unparalleled, and our architecture ensures high availability, disaster recovery, and compliance, giving your teams peace of mind.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1369003098"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;End-to-End Migration &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;From Strategy to Success&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325306i1C7E87284C5442F6/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture1.png" alt="Picture1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;The methodology is a robust, four-phase framework; Assess, Mobilize, Migrate, and Optimize, it's designed to de-risk your entire journey.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Assess:&lt;/STRONG&gt; We begin with a deep dive. A discovery workshop, a complete inventory of your SAP landscape, and defining non-functional requirements like Recovery Point Objectives/Recovery Time Objectives. The goal is to produce a precise, tailored architecture and cost model. Conduct transfer knowledge sessions with internal team to be able to operate the SAP landscape on the cloud.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mobilize:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is the planning and preparation stage. We conduct technical validation, create a detailed migration plan, execute all prerequisites checks, and importantly, on-board and upskill your teams, ensuring a smooth transition of ownership post-migration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Migrate:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The execution phase. We utilize best-in-class tools and zero-downtime techniques where possible, ensuring business continuity throughout the process.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Optimize:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is continuous value realization. We move from just running SAP to reducing cost through rightsizing, minimizing future risk, and increasing organizational agility by leveraging cloud services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The benefits are clear: &lt;STRONG&gt;Reduce TCO, Minimize Risk, Increase Agility, and Innovate.&lt;/STRONG&gt; We measure our success not by the project completion date, but by the realization of these benefits in your business.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1172489593"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Targeted Business Outcomes of Migrating SAP to Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture2.png" style="width: 902px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325307i0E4F69B5CB74E3AA/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture2.png" alt="Picture2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;This figure shows the full scope of business outcomes you can achieve once your core SAP systems are modernized on the cloud. Think of your SAP data flowing seamlessly into the cloud, unlocking potential in every direction:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost Reduction &amp;amp; Data Center Retirement:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The immediate, tangible saving by eliminating technical debt and shifting from CaPx to OpEx.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Performance &amp;amp; Auto-scaling:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Dramatically faster operations and environments that automatically adjust to workload, guaranteeing peak performance during critical business cycles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agility and Staff Productivity:&lt;/STRONG&gt; By offloading infrastructure management to our managed services, your highly skilled IT staff can dedicate their time to high-value projects, not maintenance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Digital Transformation (SAP S/4HANA):&lt;/STRONG&gt; This infrastructure is the perfect foundation for a future S/4HANA transformation, leveraging the speed of HANA and the elasticity of cloud hosting.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data and Analytics:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The critical ability to integrate your SAP data with the vast array of cloud analytical tools like SAC, Amazon Redshift or MS PowerBI, to gain deep, competitive business insights and complex data science applications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improved Security and Resilience:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A globally secure and highly available platform that meets stringent compliance requirements.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Industry Solutions:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; With SAP migration onto cloud, you will not just benefit from cloud hosting or cloud services only; but you will gain the benefit of utilize a lot of business solution that leverage your business operations and streamline your business applications platform and all are running onto cloud and integrates together to leverage your business performance and efficiency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hope my thoughts useful for you and guide you to the right decision&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":thumbs_up:"&gt;👍&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;thank you all and wish you a smooth and successful migration.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;#Conversion #Migration &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+HANA/pd-p/73554900100700000996" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="639-1"&gt;SAP HANA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Any order from a child uses the same limit; if exposure is insufficient, the credit check blocks the document and you release or not in Documented Credit Decisions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/PRODUCT_ID/918bca53037f408f91a2295d04ac16bc/be5747120f22446dbaeabc02044722d3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal-Receivables Management-Manage Credit Accounts&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;If you still want a contract control (secondary)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Value Contract at 100,000 (parent as Sold-To, children as Ship-To) will stop releases only when orders reference the contract; monitor with &lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F2013')/S35" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Value Contract Consumption&lt;/A&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello, I used this approach to implement data only modules with the BTP TF provider.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With data-only TF modules the github workflows execution times are very short (less than 1 minute) thus they do not exceed the validity of the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;GitHub-issued short-lived JWT assertion.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What about if I wnated for instance to provision a hana cloud instance ? From experience this would take more than the 5 minutes validity of the&amp;nbsp;GitHub-issued short-lived JWT assertion.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Xavier,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you so much for your detailed response — really appreciate it!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;actually already had the article you referenced and had thought along the same lines. I’ve thought the workaround with a custom column pulling the date from a lookup table, just like you suggested, as a temporary solution until I find something more robust (or something I might have missed). Thanks again for confirming the approach and for sharing the link!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Τhank you,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Olga&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Each station has multiple charging points where customers can park and charge their EVs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ZingCharge has an annual revenue of €100 million and offers a subscription service called &lt;STRONG&gt;CHARGEASYOUGO&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This service allows subscribers to charge their vehicles for a fee at any ZingCharge-affiliated station. Then ZingCharge uses the charge session information to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Invoice subscribers at the end of the month for the electric charging consumption used irrespective of where and which partner has been used.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Settle with these partners using the same charging session information.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1044059363"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325615i3E80299DAEC7D53C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="1.jpg" alt="1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ZingCharge’s Problem&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ZingCharge uses static validation rules capabilities of SAP Convergent Mediation, public cloud edition. However, these static rules aren’t enough to capture hidden data issues beyond the known patterns (e.g., faulty sensors). Therefore they are facing challenges due to inefficiencies in its billing and revenue tracking processes, making it difficult to identify issues without significant manual effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manual monitoring: 30 person-days (costly)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manual troubleshooting: 60 person-days (costly)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Invoice delays (Days Sales Outstanding): 10 days&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Revenue leakage due to poor data quality: €1M (1% of revenue).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Poor customer experience: NPS degradation, reduced upsell, potential churn&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-847545858"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="2.jpg" style="width: 358px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325613iD51DC78B24E1212D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2.jpg" alt="2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key persona perspective&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-780115072"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How to Solve for Billing Accuracy&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Wherever there’s usage based-billing, for example measuring services consumed, e.g., “kWh” in Utilities, “Gigabytes” in Telecom or “API calls” in Software as a Service – there’s always a cost associated with inaccurate bills reaching the customer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Either the customer is overcharged, which increases the risk of dispute management efforts, customer churn, and reputation damage.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Alternatively, the customer is undercharged, and there’s risk of revenue leakage and setting unreasonable customer expectations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Trying to solve the accuracy problems further downstream in billing requires high manual efforts, which are both slow and costly from a labor perspective, with the following risks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Delaying the delivery of bills to the customers and subsequent collection of payments, increasing the Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), which adds further cost to the process and decreases cash flow.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Overwhelming billing operations with manual corrections of bills during intensive (and delayed) bill-runs – time spent better on more strategic work.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Frustrating the customers with long dispute management process and credit correction memos.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Undercharging the customer due to undetected anomalies, leading to revenue leakage.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Early detection of potential data problems during the mediation process addresses these billing operations risks. It does so by flagging suspicious data records continuously as potential anomalies for billing operations inspection. This allows the billing operations team to apply corrective actions in billing as soon as the anomalies are detected, throughout the month, allowing correct bills to reach the customers in a timely manner with less manual effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The picture below shows in the top lane how a typical customer uses mediation today, with static validation rules, correcting the data quality issues in billing in a highly manual way. In the bottom lane, it’s shown how a customer by adding Usage Anomaly Detection can automate parts of their billing accuracy process and improve the business outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-454518848"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="3.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325612iF9C0001581835FCD/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="3.jpg" alt="3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Example Classic Bill Run vs with SAP Convergent Mediation + Usage Anomaly Detection&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-387088062"&gt;How Can Usage Anomaly Detection Improve Data Quality?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The feature is designed to take the mediation data quality to the next level by addressing the so-called “&lt;STRONG&gt;Known-unknowns&lt;/STRONG&gt;”. I.e., the usage data problems we know exist, but we don’t know how to capture with traditional static validation rules. Here, the machine learning algorithms extend the error detection capabilities of mediation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The “&lt;STRONG&gt;Known-knowns&lt;/STRONG&gt;” are issues that we have high awareness of and know how to address, typically solved through validation rules and reprocessing in mediation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-61491838"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="4.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325616iF73F776E00F33310/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="4.jpg" alt="4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Overview of new types of data problems addressable with combined machine learning and billing operations analysis.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--5938948"&gt;What’s the New Feature?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, SAP Convergent Mediation, public cloud edition, already captures many types of known errors with static validation rules and allows them to be classified, managed in Data Correction facility and corrected in bulk. The new Usage Anomaly Detection feature enables &lt;EM&gt;additional&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;types of data issues to be detected and resolved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new feature in a nutshell:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Out-of-the-box Usage Anomaly Detection feature powered by machine learning to identify patterns and detect anomalies within usage data streams.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This predictive capability helps organizations proactively identify potential issues, unusual consumption patterns, and data quality concerns before they impact business operations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When potential anomalies are detected, the system leverages GenAI to generate detailed analyses of each anomaly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;These AI-generated analyses are displayed within the Usage intelligence dashboard, providing users with immediate, actionable insights.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additionally, this analysis can be shared with relevant stakeholders via email, ensuring that key individuals are promptly informed and able to respond as needed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-438204911"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="5.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325618i66D54E44B2EB7918/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5.jpg" alt="5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Overview of usage data flowing through mediation and Usage Anomaly Detection&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--51711601"&gt;Customer Onboarding Process&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below are the typical steps in the onboarding process for current SAP Convergent Mediation, public cloud edition, customers in enabling this Usage Anomaly Detection feature.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Activate the Usage Anomaly Detection package in their tenant via an SAP4Me “Service Request”.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create one or more streams that forward the training data sets via the Usage Intelligence forwarder function in the required format (at least 15 days’ worth of data).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the background, the DigitalRoute team will set up the Machine Learning pipelines for each type of data (e.g, kWh, Gigabytes, API Calls).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tune the Machine Learning pipeline through several iterations. This is normally a joint exercise with the DigitalRoute team, where large sets of data are used to reach maximum accuracy (ideally up to 90 days of usage data).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Once DigitalRoute team have tuned the models to desired accuracy, the Usage Anomaly Detection function is ready for production use.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--248225106"&gt;How Does the User Interact with Usage Anomaly Detection?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below is an example scenario, where the customer, an Electric Vehicle charging provider, has setup Usage Anomaly Detection on their charging stations and attached charging points. The purpose is to capture unexpected patterns early in the mediation process, due to for example, faulty sensors or fraud attempts and address the proactively in billing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Customer configures Billing Operations email address to receive potential anomaly notifications – &amp;nbsp;the emails include links to anomalies for Billing Operations to inspect.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--151335604"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="6.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325617iB3075745F4D86A39/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="6.jpg" alt="6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;E-mail notification of Potential Anomaly for Billing Operations Inspections&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. The links leads to the Usage Anomaly Detection Business Dashboard, with an overview of the new, unhandled, and handled anomalies. As well as individual and groups of data sources with most anomalies.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--347849109"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="7.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325619iE49299D262421034/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="7.jpg" alt="7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Business Dashboard – Anomaly Overview&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. From the Business Dashboard, Billing Operations can go to the new anomaly overview, from where they can select the most interesting one (highest probability and high value).&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="8.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326497iAB9855AB93289A12/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="8.jpg" alt="8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Business Dashboard – Drill-Down View of Anomalies with Probability and Value&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4. There they will see a detailed screen with GenAI description of the anomaly and graphed usage. They can also zoom out the usage, for example over three months, for the operator to get a better understanding.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="9.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325621iD20A21724BDE7A05/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="9.jpg" alt="9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Business Dashboard – Historic Usage and Generative AI Description of Anomaly&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5. From there, Billing Operations can mark the inspected anomaly as confirmed anomaly or as normal. If marked as confirmed anomaly, the operator can send an email from the Business Dashboard to a support email address for investigation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="10.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325622iA05B1A43BEEA01F4/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="10.jpg" alt="10.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Business Dashboard – Detailed Graph of Historic Usage over Three Months&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Moreover, the Business Dashboard allows the operator persona to share anomalies to be checked with Support and other relevant colleagues with a few clicks and send a mail with GenAI generated natural language description of the issue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--837765621"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Benefits of Usage Anomaly Detection:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proactive Issue Detection:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Identifies usage data anomalies early in the mediation process, preventing errors from being addressed continuously after they are detected.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reduced Manual Effort:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Automates Usage Anomaly Detection and explanation, minimizing the need for time-consuming manual investigations and corrections.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Revenue Protection:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Helps prevent both overcharging and undercharging, reducing revenue leakage and the risk of customer disputes and churn.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Faster, More Accurate Billing:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Accelerates billing cycles and improves invoice accuracy, leading to quicker payments and enhanced customer satisfaction.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Actionable Insights and Collaboration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Provides easy-to-understand, GenAI-powered resolution across billing teams.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quantified Business Outcomes of Usage Anomaly Detection&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;60% reduction in revenue leakage by proactively addressing usage data issues.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;90% less manual effort required to resolve dependencies in quote-to-cash cycle.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figures are based on customer proof-of-concept project performed in 2024/2025.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--740876119"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="11.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/325623iDD235E8793DCD4A9/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="11.jpg" alt="11.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Key Persona helped by the Usage Anomaly Detection feature&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1230792631"&gt;Further readings&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAZ/pages/464584835/Usage+Intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Usage Intelligence - Usage Engine Cloud Edition Documentation - InfoZone&lt;/A&gt; (DigitalRoute InfoZone)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://infozone.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAZ/pages/473792537/Usage+anomaly+detection" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Usage anomaly detection - Usage Engine Cloud Edition Documentation - InfoZone&lt;/A&gt; (DigitalRoute InfoZone)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

Or maybe don't know the answer to your question and decided not respond. Or maybe is only checking the community weekly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bear in mind also, that there is people (like me) who deactivate the "E-Mail" option in comments and e-mails to avoid the spam:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MariaSanz_1-1760341321210.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326531iAE0CD77E11AD7AFD/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MariaSanz_1-1760341321210.png" alt="MariaSanz_1-1760341321210.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;KR Isa&lt;/P&gt;</content>
