    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Geographical Enablement Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;(in short&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Geo Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt;, as its name suggests, is a framework that is used to add geo spatial attributes to any S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition or S/4HANA on-Premise business object. This consists of configuration and ABAP class development for each object to be geo enabled.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Because of the way an end user might wish to render an object on the map, and what business functions they wish to use from the map can differ greatly among customers and industries, SAP provides sample implementations of configuration and ABAP classes. This&amp;nbsp; provides out of the box working examples that can be evaluated, and used as templates for the customer implementation project. In many cases the delivered examples are not used in the productive environment, with a customer enhanced copy of the object used.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog series will be a technical discussion suited to consultants, and customer power users, involved in implementation of the Geo Framework. Reading and following the documentation is extremely important as the majority of implementation issues I have seen over the years are directly attributed to not following this first piece of advice. I will be focusing on the new S/4HANA 2025 release where we no longer require the installation of the SAP_GEF schema, and now have the spatial data storage in ABAP DDIC tables. Other than location of the spatial content, the majority of the information is also applicable for previous releases. Due to current technical constraints, query access to the spatial data is still via a native HANA view which now reside in the S/4HANA schema with a prefix '/1BCAMDP/GEF_' for easy identification.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Geo Framework consists of 3 main components.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;An ABAP based persistence layer that is responsible for spatial relevant database access via ABAP ADBC calls. API's are part of this layer.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A Map Provider implementation that consists of a web service and handles incoming requests and output processing. The default implementation from SAP is based on the Esri REST specification for a feature service. SAP only implements functions of the Esri REST specification required for internal use, but it may allow use by non-SAP tools with a customers own ICF node and subclass implementation, in conjunction with own method redefinitions in the Geo Object class. Other map API's could be implemented as an alternate or parallel Map Provider. Multiple map providers may be active at the same time. When a map provider API requires a license, the customer is responsible for any licensing agreements. The Geo Framework is a BYOL (Bring your own license) model since SAP relies on third party API's for comprehensive map provider visualization tools. SAP provides an Esri based map provider by default, given our large customer base overlap. If the SAP customer is already an Esri customer, then it is likely an agreement is already in place, but should be confirmed with Esri. &amp;nbsp;If the customer does NOT have a current Esri relationship and wishes to use the Geo Framework, they must engage with Esri themselves. There are a number of options for this, one being a subscription to Esri's&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;ArcGIS Location Platform as described in the master note mentioned below.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A Javascript based UI5 Map and Editor application for accessing spatially aware business data, external GIS data, and initiating business processes from the map. The map could be described as a context aware Fiori Launchpad where tiles are replaced by actions executed on the objects selected from the map. Essentially the map fills parameters to allow direct access to the business application, bypassing the typical entry screens.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Installation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first step in implementation is to understand the components required for correct implementation. Reading&amp;nbsp; Master Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;A title="3149622" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https://me.sap.com/notes/3149622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3149622&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;should be one of the first tasks for the implementor. This note will explain the backend and UI components for each release on S/4HANA, which releases support which version of the Esri API the map uses, 3.x or 4.x, and which catalogs to use in role creation. It also provides information on SAP Web Dispatcher port mapping should there be a Central UI Server deployment. Customers running S/4HANA 2022 or later should use the 4.x API applications where possible. Esri has deprecated the 3.x API and SAP will discontinue supporting this version of the map application in a future release. If for some reason the 3.x API is required, it is possible to run both applications in parallel during a cutover period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enterprise search is utilized within the Geo Framework and needs to be configured as per the &lt;A title="ESH documentation" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/86dbe289f813483abd78de6a52458bff/9a848d5720c0b576e10000000a4450e5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;documentation&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is strongly suggested that all outstanding notes released after your current support package be applied for the Geo Framework UI and backend systems. Component CA-EPT-GEF is used for the core framework and UI. Other applications such as Enterprise Asset Management have their own component for application related notes, PM-GEF in the case of spatial asset management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I always suggest that before any major decisions are made that the sample configuration for the Business Partner be activated and tested. This ensures that the underlying framework is configured and running before you start activating configuration for other business applications, or customers own objects. Simply activating another application component Business function without the default Sample implementation will fail, as the Application specific BC sets rely of the default implementation to be in place. For example, all the Framework specific fields such as the Object Key and Geometry Context that are in the Application configuration will not be present and the BC set will fail to install correctly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Spatial reference 3857 will be active in the S/4HANA database by default so for now there is no need to worry about an own SRS as the delivered OpenStreetmap basemap uses SRS 3857.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The start to installation you need to activate the Business Function &lt;A title="FND_GEF" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/86dbe289f813483abd78de6a52458bff/7430ad5789cfca02e10000000a4450e5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;FND_GEF&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and associated BC set&amp;nbsp;as per the documentation. Depending on the activating user authorizations, such as cross client config, the BC sets associated with the Business Function may not fully activate. Check the status in the Switch Framework Browser. Below you can see everything is active with the yellow highlighted items indicating only certain clients are active. Clicking on the traffic lights will show activation status for each client.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_1-1765246168840.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349879i8FFAE4FC6E814E7A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_1-1765246168840.png" alt="kwmorrow_1-1765246168840.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Should you not have all green check marks, you can go to the switch, by double clicking the highlighted node, and manually activate the dependent BC sets as per image below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_3-1765246539612.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349883iF76D58D520ADDF86/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_3-1765246539612.png" alt="kwmorrow_3-1765246539612.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Press the highlighted icon and you will get the popup. Press Continue and you get the following popup. Make the settings as per image and Continue.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_4-1765246709131.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349884i942F8D17BA901AA0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_4-1765246709131.png" alt="kwmorrow_4-1765246709131.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This will manually rerun the BC set activation, overwriting previous entry ensuring activation in the current client.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go back to the Switch Framework Browser to verify the activation status.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Review and adjustment of Customizing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After activation of the BC sets it is recommended you perform a quick review of the customizing, and make adjustments as required for your particular instance. More on this further down.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first configuration to check is the Geo Framework Map Provider settings accessed using transaction code &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;GEF_GIS_CONFIG&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_0-1765816999012.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352215i43BFEDE4593AC138/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_0-1765816999012.png" alt="kwmorrow_0-1765816999012.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You need to ensure that the ICF node for the GIS Service Path is active in the system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ensure that the Esri data types were correctly loaded. These data types will be used to set the data types of the ABAP fields being sent to the map.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_1-1765817162317.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352216iB0DEF52071290E98/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_1-1765817162317.png" alt="kwmorrow_1-1765817162317.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ensure that all Framework Technical Structure Fields are present. These fields are used within the framework to move geometry data back and forth between the database, ABAP programs and the map. The Map Specific Data type is important and an incorrect setting here can produce strange behavior.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_2-1765817393237.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352234iB0AF30074A0FB437/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_2-1765817393237.png" alt="kwmorrow_2-1765817393237.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The next node is an alternate view of the Geo Object field mappings from the transaction &lt;EM&gt;GEF_FRW_CONFIG&lt;/EM&gt; which allows you to view all Geo Objects configured in the client and mass process the field mappings, rather than individually in the Framework Configuration transaction. Here we see the two Geo objects for the person (PERSON) and Organization (ORGN) belonging to the Sample Business Object, Business Partner (BP) .&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_3-1765817943510.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352236iE0BDB39600085F97/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_3-1765817943510.png" alt="kwmorrow_3-1765817943510.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Field mappings for the PERSON Geo Object.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_4-1765817988120.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352237iA307476308628975/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_4-1765817988120.png" alt="kwmorrow_4-1765817988120.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After verifying the Map Provider configuration, the geo enablement settings for the business data need to be verified with transaction &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;GEF_FRW_CONFIG&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following diagram shows the default configuration for a new S/4HANA 2025 system. Many sections are self explanatory and I will skip over unless there is an explicit change from previous releases. If you need more detail, please see the appropriate documentation page.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_0-1765822397067.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352283i3281E62AA231F762/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_0-1765822397067.png" alt="kwmorrow_0-1765822397067.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are upgrading from a system that was at some stage in the past an ECC system, your Schema Name in GDB may need to be adjusted. A new S/4HANA system will be installed with a database schema named &lt;STRONG&gt;SAPHANADB&lt;/STRONG&gt; and is the default value from the BC set. ECC HANA database schemas typically used the format SAP&amp;lt;SID&amp;gt;, for example &lt;STRONG&gt;SAPEPR&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and you need to adjust the configuration value to your system configuration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Maximum Record Count defines the number of records selected for each map tile query. Early versions of ArcGIS server (the default Geo Framework Map Provider is based on the Esri REST specification) by default limited the maximum records per query to 1000. Later releases increased this to 2000. SAP does not recommend exceeding the default Esri values for performance reasons. SImilar situation with the Enterprise Search Max Count values.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For those familiar with the pre 2025 versions of the Geo Framework, you will notice the new ABAP DDIC based database class and the upper case prefix and view name. The prefix when using DDIC tables is limited to a maximum of 13 characters to fit with the DDIC table name format. The last 3 characters are used for the geometry type to be stored in the table giving 16 chars total (3 used by SAP). It is suggested to keep the view name short but meaningful with the default being GEOM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system settings level database fields are now only for backwards compatibility. From S/4HANA 2025, the Business Object will be the default level for the database settings, hence there are none of the new geometry dimension settings at the System Level.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the &lt;EM&gt;Icons for Symbols&lt;/EM&gt; setting you need to ensure the s4 version of the icons are configured. Those upgrading from the older UIGEF001 map component may be using the mime repository path for the old version which is not present in a 2025 system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_1-1765823455907.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352292iF13601D2E60D693F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_1-1765823455907.png" alt="kwmorrow_1-1765823455907.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each Business Object now has it's own number range object with a single number range interval '01', replacing the single native HANA sequence used for the GEF_OBJECTID value. Please see documentation for&amp;nbsp;&lt;A title="number range details" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/86dbe289f813483abd78de6a52458bff/f3a1cc56154d4223e10000000a44147b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;number range details&lt;/A&gt;. The Business partner uses a default number range object GEF_GEN which will be used as a fallback if a business object configuration does not contain a number range. When migrating from HANA spatial table to DDIC tables, the number range status for each number range needs to initially be set to a value greater than the current HANA sequence value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_2-1765824355528.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352294i1C3A78DF41CB7971/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_2-1765824355528.png" alt="kwmorrow_2-1765824355528.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Geometry Attributes section mimic the database settings of an Esri featureclass, defining the dimensionality and any default values when working with Z coordinates. Enhancements to the documentation on Geometry Attributes will be part of the future FPS1 documentation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;*** Deviation from default configuration ***&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since the initial BC set development, SAP has moved to CDS based search helps and the customizing in S/4HANA 2025 FPS0 requires adjustment. Updated BC sets with more examples will be coming in a future feature pack release.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For now we can make some adjustments that will provide more insight into the workings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Update the Geo object settings to use the CDS based Enterprise Search model. You will notice a Z class for the Implementation class. We will cover this lower down but include in the change now. Make the same changes for both the PERSON and ORGN Geo Objects. The Z class will be the same as default with Z prefix (ZCL_GEF_BP_PERSON_SAMPLE and ZCL_GEF_BP_ORGANIZATION_SAMPLE).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_1-1765830786669.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352329iE1B173FC6A5056B2/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_1-1765830786669.png" alt="kwmorrow_1-1765830786669.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Update the PERSON and ORGN field mappings to use the CDS Enterprise Search Models. You need to add mappings from the structure fields to the search model fields. Update your configuration as per the diagram below for the PERSON and ORGN. This tells the search to use the search field names in place of the structure field names.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_0-1765830556241.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352328i199E1D29E4510651/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_0-1765830556241.png" alt="kwmorrow_0-1765830556241.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Now we need to create new Geo Object classes as a &lt;STRONG&gt;copy&lt;/STRONG&gt; of the delivered class. You will need developer access for this task. I will detail the PERSON in class ZCL_GEF_BP_PERSON_SAMPLE but do the same for the ORGN in class ZCL_GEF_BP_ORGANIZATION_SAMPLE.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Update method IF_GEF_BO_SERVICE~COMPOSE_GEF_OBJKEY&amp;nbsp;as below. This will allow use of the CDS field name in the determination of the GEF_OBJKEY value.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;METHOD if_gef_bo_service~compose_gef_objkey.

This can be used to ensure the correct path for mime repository map icons is used, especially if deployed with a central UI server. In the above graphic there are servers for alternate basemaps, GIS servers and portals, but this is not required for the base configuration and will be discussed in later blogs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The default basemap delivered is OpenStreetMap which requires no server settings, hence no entries delivered by default.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The basemap set includes the initial map location and zoom level on launch. You can adjust these values to a location more appropriate for your organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_1-1765827082353.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352300iA704A70D7175FB09/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_1-1765827082353.png" alt="kwmorrow_1-1765827082353.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the &lt;EM&gt;Icons for Symbols&lt;/EM&gt; entry from above, I have enhanced with a server pointing to my base system as this is configured with embedded Fiori.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_2-1765827237763.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352301i74652667F67EBAF4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_2-1765827237763.png" alt="kwmorrow_2-1765827237763.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The default configuration comes with no Reference Layers configured. The default Business layer group contains the business layers for PERSON and ORGN geo objects. I will show this on the map menu.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In order to search for a location you need to configure a map locator service such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_3-1765827596502.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352302i80D028F1247260D3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_3-1765827596502.png" alt="kwmorrow_3-1765827596502.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This configuration should now allow the default use of the map after allocation of appropriate authorizations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Authorizations and roles&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In order to use the map applications, the required authorizations must be configured as defined in the &lt;A title="Auth documentation" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/86dbe289f813483abd78de6a52458bff/a33a90a0f7b54ce1a9ee4ab4abf4b012.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;documentation&lt;/A&gt;. A role is required with Authorization Object &lt;STRONG&gt;G_GEF_GEOM&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;to control access to geometry and is created via the template&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP_GEF_USR. Authorizations are also required for users with the task to create new spatial tables and views. I will cover these topics more in a future part of the series.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There is no standard role at this time for the Geo Framework apps.&amp;nbsp; The catalogs required are described in the aforementioned Master Note (see the importance of reading this note &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt; ). It is suggested you create a role for the map/editor applications and another for the authorizations. There are no authorizations directly on the map applications, it is the content of the map that is controlled. Since different business objects may have different access requirements, there may be numerous geometry roles in addition to the role containing the map applications. You may also choose to create a role for the map and a role for the editor as a means of controlling edit access on top of geometry level control.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now that we have configuration and authorizations setup we can test the map as per the &lt;A title="Apps documentation" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/86dbe289f813483abd78de6a52458bff/e7c2975772269f2de10000000a44147b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Application Functions&lt;/A&gt; section of the documentation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Let's explore the map&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here my user has roles for both the 3.x API apps (Spatial Asset Management) and the 4.x apps (Spatial Data Management). The Explorer app will verify configuration for displaying map layers and the Editor app will verify that the Enterprise Search is correctly configured. The Editor can select ANY Geo object that meets the geo object filter requirement. To do this, it does an Enterprise search with the field filter values in the selection parameters. The result list then shows which objects do and do not have geometry with a geometry indicator. From there you open the map at the default extent defined in various ways. This will be covered in another part of the series. The Explorer can only display an object that already has geometry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_4-1765828509909.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352313i5CEF90465959F7FB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_4-1765828509909.png" alt="kwmorrow_4-1765828509909.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clicking on the Spatial Data Editor and searching for a Person we get the list of active Person business partners in the system. Select one and it will take you to the editor to add geometry. Select the point and click and save. Do this for a few items.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_2-1765833449627.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352332i4BAAB29970CF8FAB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_2-1765833449627.png" alt="kwmorrow_2-1765833449627.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then search for an Organization and edit geometry. For the Organization you will notice a context menu as this Geo Object has multiple contexts allowed. Select a context and create a geometry. Notice how the selected context sets the allowed geometry editing tools. After creating different geometry contexts, select the all contexts and see the overview.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_3-1765833610854.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352336i9468CE0A572431FE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_3-1765833610854.png" alt="kwmorrow_3-1765833610854.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now we can display on the Explorer map and execute business transactions if configured. There are none in the BP sample but we will see this in the next article of the series.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clicking on the Spatial Data Explorer we load the map at the default location defined in the Basemap set used in the default profile.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this image we have the Business Partner layers shown in the menu. Note, the system I am using also has EAM configured so please ignore this for now. We will cover this in the next article of the series.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_0-1765832793598.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352330iE215A8F3FBF9C13A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_0-1765832793598.png" alt="kwmorrow_0-1765832793598.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this image we see the PERSON's on the map.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_1-1765833128376.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352331i9307E2B64E9E1DF0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_1-1765833128376.png" alt="kwmorrow_1-1765833128376.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click on the person and you will see the popup.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kwmorrow_4-1765833894733.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352338iE616925E81A81F24/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="kwmorrow_4-1765833894733.png" alt="kwmorrow_4-1765833894733.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Congratulations. Once you have the ability to add geometry to an object, display the object in business layers, and see data in the popup, your system is ready for further customizing and additional Business Object implementations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope that this first article was helpful in getting the base SAP Geo Framework up and running, and peak your interest in executing your S/4HANA applications from a map.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the next part of the series we will cover the activation of Enterprise Asset Management Business Objects.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello dear SAP team,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We need clarification on whether the use of HR employee master data and HR organizational management in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2021 (product 8010833 RISE with S/4HANA Cloud, private edition) is included in the core and therefore already licensed, or whether it requires an additional license via a line-of-business (LoB) solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on our understanding of the business scope (here - SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition based on SAP S/4HANA 2023 FPS03-), we assume that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;• Organizational management is included/assigned within S/4HANA Enterprise Management "Organizational Management" and&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;• HR master data is included/assigned within S/4HANA Enterprise Management "HR Administration".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If these two features require additional licensing, please provide us with the necessary products, including their material numbers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;KR,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Michael&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I created a Purchase Order in ME21N with Item 10 and Item 20. While saving the PO, the system automatically added the empty material as Item 11 and Item 21.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When I created the Outbound Delivery, the empty material for Item 10 (Item 11) was transferred successfully. However, the empty material for Item 20 (Item 21) was not transferred to the outbound delivery.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Could you please help us understand&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;What could be the possible reason for this behavior?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Where should we check in the system to identify the issue?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for your support.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are using the RPA entitlements bundled with the ByDesign subscription. We also have a BTP account for other use cases. The ByD-bundled RPA gets provisioned to its own BTP Global Account / Subaccount to which we do not have access.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Several features of RPA requires configuration in the BTP Subaccount, for example maintaining destinations. Trying to access that however results in an error.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="carlonnheim_0-1766048524771.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353495iE35DFF61140AC027/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="carlonnheim_0-1766048524771.png" alt="carlonnheim_0-1766048524771.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="carlonnheim_1-1766048568028.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353496i78F02FE64088EBE3/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="carlonnheim_1-1766048568028.png" alt="carlonnheim_1-1766048568028.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I can see our other global accounts there, but not the one where the RPA lives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is the procedure to gain access to the subaccount so we can maintain the required settings?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;//Carl&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Wei,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for the workaround but we do not know if it is workable for CIG. CIG is mandatory filed in Italian Invoicing process if user are handling business with public partner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We did not see your result in billing document. Have you check if this information could be carried to billing document and to the header text info?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The CIG in header text is normally used for E-document mapping and in your example, another text type is suggested.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The text type&amp;nbsp;represents normally the purpose of the text. It is kind of misused to have different info under one type.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, if your workaround is not working for E-invoice, could you inform SAP to develop the same note/Text file in Service order instead of using this workaround.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you and BR&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Betty&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi, Thanks for the reply. Already raised to SAP but no correction notes informed by them. Its quite interesting to see the headers as well. When you generate the report, reporting period and comparison period both have headers for 2025. Checking some other alternative like Balance Sheet / Income Statement Multidimensional Fiori app. This gives the result but the issue is you cannot restrict the results for end user at Company Code level</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;With the December release of SAP Business Network for Logistics, we’re delivering important updates designed to refine the user experience and boost operational efficiency. In this blog post, we’ll outline the new features and capabilities introduced in this release.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Specifically, please note the availability of the following features that were requested via influence portal:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Changes to the contracting process in SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration such as ocean tendering and support of consignment orders&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Availability of instance-based authorization in the ‘Manage Freight Execution’ app&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;New features in Dock Appointment Scheduling such as derived appointment duration and loading point capacity increase&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Simplified invoicing though alternative IDs in SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enhancement of the ‘In Execution’ status logic in SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;New version of the planned events chart in the ‘Track Shipments’ app in SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Cross SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration and SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Switch to DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business Network for Logistics&amp;nbsp;is switching its root Certificate Authority to&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;DigiCert TLS RSA4096 Root G5&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the domain&amp;nbsp;*.logistics.*.business-network.cloud.sap&amp;nbsp;to enhance security and trust. This change requires customers to ensure their systems trust the new certificate to maintain seamless connectivity and user access before &lt;U&gt;January 14, 2026&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information, see SAP Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https://me.sap.com/notes/3688060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3688060&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please note: no code corrections are required, just import the certificates (to comply with latest &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;amp;v=6" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;security standards&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;) and update:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Browser in case of end user sign-in&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sending system in case of B2B connectivity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Users find a notification on the launch-pad banner, providing them with a link to the SAP note &lt;EM&gt;and&lt;/EM&gt; to the shipper resp. carrier Admin Guides (for users without SAP note access).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;UI5 upgraded to version 1.136.11&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The UI5 version of the SAP Fiori Launchpad was upgraded to 1.136.11.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Migration of authentication from XSUAA to IAS (prerequisite for instance-based authorization – see ‘Manage Freight Execution’ app)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the new, harmonized tracking experience, we are also introducing the new instance-based authorization capability on SAP Cloud Identity Service. For details see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/business-network-freight-collaboration/application-help/apply-instance-based-authorization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/business-network-freight-collaboration/application-help/apply-instance-based-authorization&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To enjoy the features provided by SAP Cloud Identity services, such as applying instance-based authorization in the&amp;nbsp;’Manage Freight Execution&lt;STRONG&gt;’&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;app, you must migrate the authentication from SAP Authorization and Trust Management (XSUAA) to SAP Identity Authentication service (IAS) at tenant level. This affects the way of sign-in to the apps on the Fiori Launchpad for&amp;nbsp;SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please raise a ticket under the component&amp;nbsp;SBN-LBN-FC-CFG&amp;nbsp;to request the migration support. For more information, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/PRODUCTS/3cd88d790c174bdbba1805dcb4f4d460/9beeec463d774e3595c0bd33653fc4df.html?version=cloud&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Migration of Authentication from XSUAA to IAS&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Notes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;U&gt;This is irrelevant if you don't apply instance-based authorization&lt;/U&gt; for the ‘Manage Freight Execution’ app. You can continue working with XSUAA authentication.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Other Freight Collaboration apps for Shippers (Manage Dock Appointments, Manage Gate Operations, Manage Disputes) will follow. For a transition period, the classic and new instance-based authorization concept can be used in parallel. Further notifications to be published in future.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Contracting: Ocean tendering now supported &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Shippers can now tender their ocean freight bookings to&amp;nbsp;SAP Business Network for Logistics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The&amp;nbsp;‘Confirm Freight Bookings (Ocean)’&amp;nbsp;app has been enhanced to support ocean tendering scenarios. Carriers can now confirm an ocean freight booking with a price proposal. New fields have been added in the worklist page and the detail view to support the ocean tendering scenario.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information, see &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/PRODUCTS/3cd88d790c174bdbba1805dcb4f4d460/6e3f7bc0e0304492ba56c186a66dd206.html?version=cloud&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Confirm Freight Bookings (Ocean)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353501i7E40FD4E2012B7D1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture2.png" alt="Picture2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353502iC983C7C61A0B8457/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture3.png" alt="Picture3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please note: Ocean tendering is also now supported via API Consumer API for Freight Booking and Provider API for Subcontracting.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Contracting: ‘Freight Orders for Confirmation’ app now supports consignment orders&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration can now support subcontracting of consignment orders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The consignment orders created in S/4 HANA and that are send to a carrier for confirmation will show in the ‘Freight Orders for Confirmation’ app. Carriers will see the details associated with the consignment order and can confirm (or reject) it there. The carrier’s response will be updated in the shipper’s S/4 HANA system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consignment order for subcontracting also works in API scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Contracting: cancellation scenario for freight bookings &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Freight bookings are set to status cancelled in the ‘Freight Booking for Confirmation (Ocean)’ app, when it is cancelled in an external system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Dock Appointment Scheduling: share derived appointment duration&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The TransportationOrderRequest message now includes the&amp;nbsp;LoadingDuration and UnloadingDuration fields within the&amp;nbsp;TransportationStage. Shippers can now use the derived appointment duration functionality by sending a specific duration using the above fields. For more information, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/business-network-freight-collaboration/application-help/defining-loading-point-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Defining Loading Point Settings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you already use, for example, SAP TM scheduling and planning, which would set the&amp;nbsp;RequestedLoadingDateTimePeriod&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;RequestedUnloadingDateTimePeriod, the new fields take precedence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a prerequisite, you must implement the following SAP Notes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https://me.sap.com/notes/3680384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3680384&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; – Scheduling Settings Simulation Interface&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https://me.sap.com/notes/3662698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3662698&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; – Loading and Unloading Duration in TransportationOrderRequest_Out&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https://me.sap.com/notes/2474555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2474555&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; – Additional SOA Documentation for Enterprise Services ‘Transportation Order’&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Dock Appointment Scheduling increase loading point capacity &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the&amp;nbsp;’Manage Entities’&amp;nbsp;app, shippers can now increase the loading point capacity when&amp;nbsp;’Capacity and Time Slot At’&amp;nbsp;is set to&amp;nbsp;’Loading Point Level’. After activation, a decrease is not possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture5.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353503iAC1AD88AC4CF380A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture5.png" alt="Picture5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Dock Appointment Scheduling: Provider / Consumer API for Dock Appointment Scheduling enhanced&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Provider API for Dock Appointment Scheduling and the Consumer API for Dock Appointment Scheduling now also consider blocked working hours. And we extended the length of the&amp;nbsp;LoadingPointId&amp;nbsp;field from 40 characters to 255 characters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, we made the following changes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Provider API for Dock Appointment Scheduling (GenericAppointment_In), we added the missing fields for non-stackable cargo (NonStackable) and over dimensional cargo (Oversize).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Consumer API for Dock Appointment Scheduling (GenericAppointment_Out), we adjusted the following indicators:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;HighValueIndicator&amp;nbsp;was renamed as&amp;nbsp;HighValue&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;StackableIndicator&amp;nbsp;was renamed as&amp;nbsp;NonStackable&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;OversizeIndicator&amp;nbsp;was renamed as&amp;nbsp;Oversize.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Settlement: simplified invoice submission via alternate IDs&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The&amp;nbsp;‘Provider API for Invoicing’&amp;nbsp;has been enhanced to allow ocean carriers to submit invoices more easily. This is especially useful when the carriers do not execute the freight documents themselves but mandate someone else. Carriers can now use either the master bill of lading and container ID, or the booking reference and container ID, as alternate IDs, eliminating the need for the shipper's internal freight booking ID.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Respectively, the&amp;nbsp;‘Invoice Freight Documents’&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;‘Freight Orders for Confirmation’&amp;nbsp;apps expect one of the following document reference type codes: BREF (booking reference), CONT (container) or T52 (master bill of lading) to identify a unique freight document. This feature streamlines the invoicing process by utilizing globally recognized references, ensuring accurate matching to the correct freight document and reducing administrative burdens for carriers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353504iC4ABA0D8D2184DAD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture6.png" alt="Picture6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Settlement cancellation of freight document when document is cancelled in external system &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When a freight booking that has been sent for confirmation to the carrier gets cancelled in the external system, the corresponding freight booking is cancelled in the&amp;nbsp;‘Invoice Freight Documents’&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please note that the freight booking can only be cancelled only when there is no active dispute or an invoice document corresponding to the freight booking.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Adaptations in rate limiting&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/PRODUCTS/3cd88d790c174bdbba1805dcb4f4d460/a30cc9aa84214328b30f359e8017d78b.html?version=cloud&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Rate limiting &lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for Read Service API changed to 200 requests per minute on productive and 60 requests per minute on test tenants.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&amp;nbsp;‘Manage Models’ and Track Shipments’ app: enhancement to ‘In Execution’ status logic&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Previously, the event status chart only considered the status of planned events. Now, it also considers the estimated status of planned events and comes with a different look and feel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture7.png" style="width: 528px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353505iF8AFB75FE959EE35/image-dimensions/528x264?v=v2" width="528" height="264" role="button" title="Picture7.png" alt="Picture7.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;‘Track Shipments’ app: changes to planned events chart&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Previously, only reports on planned events would set a shipment to the status ‘In Execution’. Now, there is a list of event types maintained in the ‘Manage Models’ app, that can set a shipment to ‘In Execution’, even if reported as unplanned event.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Solution owners may define their own list of relevant event types.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture8.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353506iDF4652119D612AFB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture8.png" alt="Picture8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;---------------------&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The above summarizes the key innovations for 2512.

10 mic but you only want 3 then only assign those three here. certificate will show the mic assigned here not from inspection plan.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;STEP5: Assign

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thanks for the post. I have a problem though. All my guideline checks passed, there are no errors in upgrade readiness check. When clicking on Update Version I'm getting this every time:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="halickiandrzej94_0-1766050247608.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353510iEC3E1F68016C0F0A/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="halickiandrzej94_0-1766050247608.png" alt="halickiandrzej94_0-1766050247608.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Deleting and recreating of the script step doesn't help. I don't see any errors in the browser console nor network tab.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/8543"&gt;@SreekanthSurampally&lt;/a&gt;, Do you know if this works for both .csv and .parquet files or just .csv? Thanks!</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The most likely cause is that &lt;STRONG&gt;Item 21’s empties item category or material master is not delivery relevant&lt;/STRONG&gt;, whereas Item 11’s is. Start by comparing the item category and schedule line category of both empties items, then check the material master and customizing.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I want to use an Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage account as a source in DataSphere. SAP is steering us to only using replication flows and leave data flows behind. It would be nice if Replication Flows would be a valid option everywhere then. Here's what i found:&lt;BR /&gt;Replication flows don't support .parquet files in an Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage account, however it can read .csv files though.&lt;BR /&gt;Data flows support .parquet files and .csv files in a&amp;nbsp;Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage account.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;So now we're left with the question: Should i use a Data Flow with .parquet files, as .parquet files are preferred on the data lake side,&amp;nbsp; or should i use .csv files in my data lake, as replication flows are preferred on the DataSphere side?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Datasphere/pd-p/73555000100800002141" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="16-1"&gt;SAP Datasphere&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We have a work order with a basic finish date of 31.12.2025.&amp;nbsp; Two of the operations where planned in for work to be completed on the 4th &amp;amp; 5th of October and both operations where confirmed as completed on the 18th November 2025.&amp;nbsp; But for some reason they are showing a earliest finish date &amp;amp; latest finish date of 01.01.2026.&amp;nbsp; I have checked all the other operations and they are either 31.12.2025 or a date before.&amp;nbsp; Can some please advise why this would be happening.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Kaz_0-1766051267037.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353513i938EC6FEF28B3E89/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Kaz_0-1766051267037.png" alt="Kaz_0-1766051267037.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Adrian:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;First, provide the technical names as column headers, please.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Does "Phase" column really contain the parent ID?&lt;BR /&gt;E.g. ID column reads "1", but Phase column reads "03".&lt;BR /&gt;Is there an ID in your table with "03"?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also, I believe Start and End columns must be datetime (and not just date) ,&lt;BR /&gt;e.g&amp;nbsp; something along thew lines of "1999-12-31 16:00:00"&lt;BR /&gt;This is also visible in the thread at the top &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Finally, what does your GANTT chart look like in view mode currently?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks,&lt;BR /&gt;Andreas J.A.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1895605381"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;I received a requirement from one of our clients asking if we can setup a guardrail which prevents delegators from assigning Delegates outside their Department. This requirement is very valid because delegates outside the home department will not be aware of the operations in the home Department, so there's no point in assigning the workflows to someone who is not aware of the process which could result in trouble for both the business and delegates. Immediately, I got in to action referring to the Auto Delegation Config Object and Set up a Guardrail which solved the Purpose!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1699091876"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How This Was Achieved Using Business Rules&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="muralidharansrinivasan_4-1765026482369.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349182i666FAD7BA913AE72/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="muralidharansrinivasan_4-1765026482369.png" alt="muralidharansrinivasan_4-1765026482369.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1: Access the Auto Delegation Config Object&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Navigate to &lt;STRONG&gt;Configure Object Definitions&lt;/STRONG&gt;, search for &lt;STRONG&gt;Auto Delegation Config&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and open the object. This Generic object is the foundation for storing auto-delegation setup information and the details related to it (Auto-Delegate Config Details).This is where the Guardrails should be Set up.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1631661090"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2: Create and Assign a On Save Business Rule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Next, create a on Save&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Rule&lt;/STRONG&gt; that validates the delegate’s department against the delegator’s department. The rule checks whether both Employees belong to the same department. If not, the system triggers a validation error and prevents the record from being saved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="muralidharansrinivasan_2-1765026176627.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349180iA1B9F5335FB81980/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="muralidharansrinivasan_2-1765026176627.png" alt="muralidharansrinivasan_2-1765026176627.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This rule can be customized further to include alternative or additional criteria depending on business needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1435147585"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3: Configure Auto Delegation Using the Quick Action&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the rule is assigned under the &lt;STRONG&gt;On Save&lt;/STRONG&gt; rules of the Auto Delegation Config object, users can proceed to set up their auto-delegation via the &lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Action&lt;/STRONG&gt; available on the SuccessFactors home page. The validation will run during the On-Save Action every time a delegator attempts to assign a delegate and validates the Delegator Department against the Delegatee Department&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-980468642"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Guardrails always prevent and handle unforeseen scenarios. This guardrail here configured to validate department helps businesses maintain operational efficiency and keeps the business workflow moving intact!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business Rules are the Core Engine behing SAP SuccessFactors and there's so much that can be done with Business Rules! Keep Exploring and Share how this has helped with your Organization!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2244835"&gt;@GOPIKA_SB&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Thanks for Coming up with this One! It really intrigued me!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I'm trying to get familiar with the tasks/subtasks-function in Cloud ALM as this seems promising.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;But I wonder if it is any way to view the subtasks connected to the tasks in the table view?&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;This works great in the gantt-view, but the relation between the task and subtask is not well visualized in the table view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I have created two tasks (A and B), with respective subtasks structured like this:&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Task A&lt;BR /&gt;- Subtask A1&lt;BR /&gt;- Subtask A2&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Task B&lt;BR /&gt;- Subtask B1&lt;BR /&gt;- Subtask B2&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;When viewing this in the gantt-view this is presented perfectly like this:&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kjetiltynes_0-1766051971494.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353515i714CC4DC629CCA72/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="kjetiltynes_0-1766051971494.png" alt="kjetiltynes_0-1766051971494.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;But when viewing this in the table-view, the tasks are sorted by themselves, and then all the subtasks are sorted by themselves like this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="kjetiltynes_1-1766052022287.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353516iCBD3E6B42619FD45/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="kjetiltynes_1-1766052022287.png" alt="kjetiltynes_1-1766052022287.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As the relation between the task and subtask is not visualized this gets quite messy when you have a lot of tasks / subtasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Is there any way to set up this in table view, so that the sub-tasks are placed under the task that it is related to, like in the gantt-view?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Are you a GST-registered business in Singapore subject to the GST InvoiceNow Requirement? If so, you need to submit invoice data electronically to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). This may include providing invoice notes in XML files submitted to IRAS. This blog provides guidance on how you can automate this step.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A few quick notes:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, cloud edition&amp;nbsp;is the solution to support&amp;nbsp;GST InvoiceNow requirements. For an overview, check out this blog:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-document-and-reporting-compliance-for-singapore-gst-invoicenow/ba-p/14026652" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Document and Reporting Compliance for Singapore GST InvoiceNow&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This blog applies to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, SAP S/4HANA, and SAP ERP. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This blog quotes information from&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;some IRAS guidelines. The quoted information is accurate as of the publication date of the blog&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. As these IRAS guidelines are subject to change, we recommend checking the latest versions for the most current information.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607052258"&gt;What Is an Invoice Note?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s the definition of invoice note from &lt;A href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/nationwide-e-invoicing-framework/invoicenow-technical-playbook#adcde995-ce5b-478c-a1e0-a7403fc5125e:~:text=GST%20InvoiceNow%20Requirement,-On%2015%20April" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;TX2 - Annex - Data Specification&lt;/A&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A textual note that gives unstructured information that is relevant to the Invoice as a whole such as the reason for any correction or assignment note in case the invoice has been factored.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An invoice note is displayed in one of these XML elements, depending on the invoice type:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ubl:Invoice / cbc:Note for invoices&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ubl:CreditNote / cbc:Note for credit notes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;IRAS specifies the scenarios where an invoice note is mandatory, such as credit notes and self-billing invoices. For certain special scenarios, IRAS prescribes their note texts. For example, according to the &lt;A href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/media/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/gst/etaxguide_gst_invoicenow_requirement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;e-Tax Guide “Adopting GST InvoiceNow Requirement for GST-registered Businesses (First Edition)”&lt;/A&gt;, you must include this exact note text in self-billing invoices:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The invoice is a Buyer Created Tax Invoice. The tax shown is your output tax due to the Comptroller of GST.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1410538753"&gt;The Challenge: Automating Beyond the Standard&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;To include an invoice note in a submitted XML file, you need to enter the note text in a specific source document field. For those scenarios that require specific note texts, it would be a great time-saver if the system can fill in them automatically. The standard solution already does this for these scenarios:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Self-billing invoices&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer invoices with the GST category code SRCA-S (Customer accounting supply made by supplier)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supplier invoices with the GST category code TXCA&amp;nbsp;(Standard-rated purchases of prescribed goods subject to customer accounting)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;What about other scenarios? Manually entering invoice notes is really time-consuming and prone to error.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1214025248"&gt;The Solution: BAdI to the Rescue&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can define your own logic for populating invoice notes using the following Business Add-Ins (BAdIs):&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Product&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BAdI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP S/4HANA&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP ERP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;EDOC_ADAPTOR&lt;/EM&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;SET_OUTPUT_DATA&lt;/EM&gt; method&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;EDOC_ADAPTOR_Cloud&lt;/EM&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;SET_OUTPUT_DATA&lt;/EM&gt; method&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we'll show you how to&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;create a BAdI implementation that populates invoice notes for customer invoices (eDocument type:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SGC5C_INV&lt;/SPAN&gt;) in these scenarios based on the tax code&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Invoice Note Text&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prescribed by IRAS&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tax Code You Use&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Gross Margin Scheme&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The transaction is under the Gross Margin Scheme.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;S1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Approved Marine Fuel Trader Scheme&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;The Payment of GST is not required under the AMFT Scheme.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Z1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Discounted Sale Price Scheme&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;The transaction is under the Discounted Sale Price Scheme.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;Z2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1146594462"&gt;&lt;U&gt;Step-by-Step Guide: Sample BAdI Implementation in SAP S/4HANA, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, and SAP ERP&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1079163676"&gt;Step 1: Create a customer package.&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some objects are created when you create a BAdI implementation. To transport these objects across a customer landscape, create a customer package or choose an existing customer package.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-882650171"&gt;Step 2: Create an enhancement implementation.&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this example, we create an implementation named ZEI_EDOC_ADAPTOR_SG_C5 by doing the following:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Call up the &lt;STRONG&gt;SE19&lt;/STRONG&gt; transaction.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select the &lt;STRONG&gt;New BAdI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; radio button in the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create Implementation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; section and enter&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ES_EDOCUMENT&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhancement Spot&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; field.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi, same problem here. In my case I created destination for MS Graph API as described here in points 1-6:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-q-a/to-set-up-a-destination-in-sap-btp-for-connecting-to-the-microsoft-azure/qaq-p/14176329" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-q-a/to-set-up-a-destination-in-sap-btp-for-connecting-to-the-microsoft-azure/qaq-p/14176329&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then used activity "Rest Call Web Service with Destination" where for input parameters I set destination that I preivously created as environment variables and for options I put rest of the api url to retrieve mailbox messages, so basically something like "&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;"users/(TenantID)/mailFolders('Inbox')/childFolders"&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Edit: when I try to simply "Create any variable" and put environment variable with destination to it and then run the automation, it returns:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;{} so it really looks like its not passed from BTP cockpit to Build Process Automation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Most of the developers overlook that the billing of iflows is based on the number of messages rather than the iflow design object or number of Users.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While designing an iflow a judicious choice of Multicast has to be taken into account.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The moment the multicast is used, it will split a message into a copy of a message and increase the count of messages created in the iflow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also. While creating a solution for successfactors, one optimization can be using AEM brokered rather than point to point SF querying interfaces.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Namaste!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP standard, you can eliminate the need to maintain control recipe destinations in master recipes (and the corresponding process orders using a master recipe profile like PI01_XS (for details see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/21aead0c98bd4755abdacd91c99e3393/5107bd53d34ab64ce10000000a174cb4.html?q=master+recipe&amp;amp;locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP help&lt;/A&gt;). If this profile is chosen, no control recipe destinations need to be maintained in the operation/phase overview of the master recipe/process order. If you have assigned such a profile (or changed it from profile PI01), you will recognize a white "ice cube" icon appearing in the icon bar of the operation/phase overview. Clicking on the "ice cube" icon will open the so called XStep editor (XSteps = Execution Steps). To prevent the mandatory control recipe destination maintenance,&amp;nbsp;you need to maintain a simple XStep tree root node in the XStep editor. So, click on the "ice cube" icon.&amp;nbsp; If you do not want to use PP-PI process management features (PP-PI-PMA), just create the XStep tree toot node by clicking on the corresponding button in the XStep editor. Then save your changes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Process orders that you create from such master recipes will not force you to maintain control recipe destinations in the operation/phase overview. Because the XStep tree root node of the master recipe is automatically copied from the master recipe.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Remarks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Using profiles like PI01_XS, the existence of the XStep tree root node in the master recipe/process order is mandatory. Because if such a profile is applied, the system will check for the existence of an XStep tree (root node). If no XStep tree root node is detected, the system will set the control recipe destination column to mandatory again.&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reason for this behavior: To smoothen transitions from the classical characteristic-based process instructions to XSte-based ones, customers can choose a master recipe profile where XStep usage is allowed, but not mandatory. This profile can be assigned to master recipes to determine the point in time for a migration: So, you can start with the old way to maintain your process instructions using the corresponding sub-menu of the operation/phase overview. When you decide to move on to XSteps, you just create your XStep tree data including your XStep tree(s) root node(s). At that point in time, the XStep data "overrules" the maintained content of the characteristic-based process instructions. And the column for the control recipe destination maintenance in the operation/phase overview is no longer mandatory. If you use XStep-based process instructions, the control recipe destinations are maintained in the XStep tree. This data is stored separately from the process order/master recipe.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Of course, you can also create dummy control recipe destinations (transaction O10C) and assign them to the master recipes/process orders in the usual way. But take care not to use dummy control recipe destinations of destination type 1 (ABAP-list based PI Sheets). ABAP-list based PI Sheets are outdated since 1999, and you cannot maintain or use them in SAP S/4HANA. So, you rather choose the destinations of type 2, 3, 4, or X (X available since SAP S/4HANA 2023, FPS01).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <title>Santa learns lessons from the past: Successful Agentic AI needs an Event Driven Architecture</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Most organisations realise that Agentic AI will become critical to their business. But there is still hesitation about giving up more control to these new agents. What if they make bad decisions, what if they do the wrong thing ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’ve been in the technology industry for more decades than I may care to admit. Before joining SAP, I spent 14 years working within Financial Services and Capital Markets. It is interesting to reflect on those times. Many of the challenges back then remain the same today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Financial Services, the major players did not hesitate to innovate with new technology – for them it was opportunity. Very early on they realised that trading in “simpler” financial instruments ( e.g. foreign exchange ) did not really need humans shouting excitedly at one another on the (tele)phone. That trading was quickly handed over to computers – and whilst it was perhaps not AI by today’s definition, it was certainly &lt;STRONG&gt;algorithmic&lt;/STRONG&gt; and it was most definitely &lt;STRONG&gt;autonomous&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Billions still gets traded by these Agentic AI predecessors, all based on the lightning-fast decisions they make ( but operating within parameters and thresholds defined by humans that quantify the risk ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Decisions are made as a result of an event that arises. &lt;U&gt;Better&lt;/U&gt; decisions are made knowing the wider context of that event. Yes, context comes from data. Wider context ( surprise ! ) comes from more and different data. But all that data needs to be super up-to-date, and accurate.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Financial Services firms understood and solved this also. In a 24x7 global market, there is no window for a batch run to load data. Trading systems, market data providers, stock exchanges, market and credit risk systems and more, all needed to be wired together for simultaneous update of data. Plus, it needed to be robust and flexible to add-in other market participants and their systems also.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most firms adopted architectures built around messaging-oriented middleware, with technologies like Enterprise Service Bus, Message Queue, and Event Bus amongst others, all being variations on a theme that today we call an &lt;STRONG&gt;Event Driven Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt; (EDA). Their appetite for speed pushed the technology to milli-second response times and super high-availability. Equally valuable was that the decoupled publisher-subscriber model allowed much faster and easier recovery if any of the participants in their expanded trading ecosystem did experience a failure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Perhaps such requirements seem a bit extreme for many companies operating in other industry segments. But the world is increasingly real time for the majority of businesses, and as Agentic AI plays a bigger part in your daily operations, it may be time to reflect on these lessons.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To highlight this more tangibly, I thought about a festive ( but fictional ? ) example where the capabilities of an Event Driven Architecture could really make a difference. So grab a coffee, something sweet to eat ( save the gym for the New Year ) and read on …&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Santa Inc refactors gift delivery on an Event Driven Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After decades relying on delivery to every home in sequence, Santa has realised this will no longer scale and he risks missing targets and some serious reputational damage. His operations used to be ok, but the customer base expands every year and getting to all of those in one day is now stretching the imagination.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="291356_GettyImages-1283733014_medium_jpg.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353517i5E415B5FBE57E34C/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="291356_GettyImages-1283733014_medium_jpg.jpg" alt="291356_GettyImages-1283733014_medium_jpg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Production used to be straightforward when it was just teddy bears, dolls, drums and toy trains, but now with games consoles, smartphones and other sophisticated presents it has become necessary to outsource to specialised manufacturing facilities in many countries. The elves have switched roles from sewing and carpentry to now managing supply chains, delivery bottlenecks and stock-outs – they’re stressed and threatening to go on strike ! Managing stock and purchasing was much easier when children used to write letters, but now they post their wish lists on social media – and keep changing their minds based on what is trending ! Logistics was never a problem – Rudolph and the other reindeer managed through even the harshest weather. But now they are obliged to adhere to air-traffic control diversions and compulsory rest stops. Finally, when delivering a present, it was disappointing to find out &amp;nbsp;( too late ) that the child had been naughty rather than nice. It meant carrying extra payload on the sleigh and unnecessary manufacturing and purchase costs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Santa has an extensive IT landscape and ecosystem. But he realised even his magical powers were no longer the answer – &lt;STRONG&gt;it was time to transform his operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;. But not rip and replace … even with 364 quieter days, that would still be too much work. Besides, most of the individual systems did what they needed to do – it was just they didn’t really react to each other that well. There was a lot of point-to-point connection between the production, inventory, CRM and other systems, with each repeatedly polling the other for updates – a real spaghetti architecture. Adding new suppliers’ systems into this landscape was slow. Recovering from any one system failure, having to replay lost transactions and regain overall confidence in stock quantities and delivery shipments an even bigger nightmare.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All of this was putting huge pressure on the elves. Santa has always been committed to his workforce, and he wanted the team to be happy and motivated. He looked to Agentic AI to help them, to manage the scale and complexity of supply chains. But like his elves, those AI agents would need to be super-smart, reactive, and always up to date with reliable data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And then the lightbulb went on for Santa. He was reading this &lt;A href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/06/1124323/enabling-real-time-responsiveness-with-event-driven-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article&lt;/A&gt; about Event Driven Architecture and realised that would answer so many of these problems. The synchronous and repeated point-to-point communication is taken away. Instead, events are published asynchronously, with brokers distributing and guaranteeing them, to be consumed by any system that is interested – instantly ( super-fast ) and simultaneously ( not each system in turn ). The spaghetti is now replaced by something more like a giant distributed smorgasbord in which everyone ( elves, agents and ecosystem partners ) can share all at once. &lt;EM&gt;NOTE: Santa was never a fan of spaghetti but does quite enjoy a good smorgasbord.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With an Event Driven Architecture, Santa could be much more responsive in his production runs and purchasing. Plus, new suppliers could be on-boarded quickly and easily to cater for peaks in toy popularity, as well as getting up-to-date pricing and costs across his ecosystem. On the big night itself, so many of those delivery headaches could now be mitigated. Travel and weather alerts would be provided immediately for dynamic routing updates ( and for Santa, every milli-second matters ). Add to this a real-time feed of naughty-or-nice monitoring data being gathered by event brokers across the globe ( some in very remote locations ) and made available to the dynamic routing algorithm as well as stock logistics teams ( Santa has an increasing network of warehouses that he needs to stop at – he cannot carry everything on his sleigh ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Santa and his Enterprise Architect ( another Elf ) looked at options and decided on SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh. Given that 84% of the world’s global commerce runs on SAP systems, and these already have high-value business events out-of-the-box, it was likely that much of Santa’s ecosystem could be easily included. Even for those using other vendors’ applications, the solution was open to those via industry-standard protocols, plus it was possible to include custom-built events. It did not need rip and replace, and the system could scale by adding more brokers over time to create an&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;event mesh&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Even better, that same infrastructure could be used for other event use cases ( Santa wondered about moving into Travel &amp;amp; Entertainment for the rest of the year – perhaps offering trips on the sleigh into low earth orbit – he thought that might become popular ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whilst looking at SAP, his Enterprise Architect saw SAP Build &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/joule-studio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/A&gt;, to create the AI agents. That seemed an obvious choice also – many processes would run on SAP, the most relevant and up-to-date operational data resides there, plus it offered a large choice of LLMs across the major providers. Quick to get into production also – because they rapidly needed to regain morale amongst the elves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So that’s the story of how one globally recognised brand came to explore the benefits of an Event Driven Architecture. If you recognise any similarities to challenges within your own business operation, then I would invite you learn more &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/integration-suite/advanced-event-mesh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;. Or, if you would like to see an example that the elves built earlier, then please do look at this &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2025/11/f0033bb9-297f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;short demo&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

In this sixth and final part, we discuss how the everyday work of supply chain managers will change. Key technological drivers include the rapid spread of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud technologies. This is reinforced by a socioeconomic trend: a shortage of skilled workers. While the knowledge required to handle many tasks is becoming increasingly specialized, demographic developments are shrinking the available workforce. This is already leading to highly polarizing views: on one side, some fear that many workers could lose their jobs to AI; on the other, many see AI as the best hope for staying competitive and overcoming new challenges amid the emerging shortage of skilled employees.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The reality will vary by employee and company. Although reliable forecasts are difficult given the rapid pace of change, three developments are already noticeable today. First, the range of tasks in Supply Chain Management will shift from operational to strategic activities. Second, the interaction between people and technology will change significantly. Finally, education and training for the Supply Chain Managers of the future will – and must – change.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Shifting the range of tasks from operational to strategic activities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With ongoing digitalization and use of AI, manual work is already shrinking in employees’ daily routines. By 2035, many companies will automate most routine decisions across the end-to-end supply chain – from demand forecasting and purchase order processing to dynamic route planning in logistics. Time once spent on “transaction” work – collecting, cleaning, reviewing, and documenting – will shift to coordinating a system of data platforms, decision intelligence, and AI agents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This shifts the focus of tasks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From execution to design: People set objectives, guidelines, and policies for how systems act, and design the decision logic (“guardrails”) for trade-offs across price, volume, service, and sustainability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From reaction to anticipation: The focus moves to scenario planning, Digital Twin simulations, and portfolio choices (e.g., higher service level versus less capital tied up).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From KPIs to Outcomes: Move from purely operational metrics (e.g., on-time delivery at the level of individual orders) to results-focused targets such as risk-adjusted contribution margin, customer experience, resilience levels, and sustainability impact.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The day-to-day work of 2035 becomes more strategic: In the morning, the Control-Tower environment offers an overview of the situation with current risks, opportunities, and suggestions from AI agents. Employees talk with colleagues and copilots to understand the impact of different scenarios (e.g., a supplier outage on high-margin segments), adjust policies (such as safety stocks in critical regions), run experiments in the Digital Twin, and make a few exceptional but high-impact decisions. This is accompanied by new roles such as Network Orchestrator, Scenario Strategist for end-to-end decisions, and Data Steward.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Changing how people and technology work together&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on these changes, it’s clear that technology will move from being just a tool for completing tasks to being a partner working alongside people. The following focus areas are already emerging:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copilots instead of masks: natural-language, context-enabled assistants explain suggestions, simulate alternatives, and implement policy changes. Prompting shifts from ad‑hoc commands to structured briefs that state the goal, constraints, and evaluation criteria.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Explainability and uncertainty: Recommendations include clear justifications, key drivers, confidence levels, and uncertainty ranges. Explainable AI and standard why/what‑if reports become the norm to build trust and support audits.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Continuous learning: Systems learn from everyday use. Employees provide structured feedback that flows into the models and further improves the results.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As employees hand over more control and responsibility to technology, governance needs extra care. This includes using agent-on-agent controls (agents that monitor other agents) and setting clear human release criteria and approval steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The training of the supply chain managers of the future&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The described role shifts and the new form of interaction require a profound change in training and further development. The ideal supply chain manager of the future will mix deep business experience with fluency in new tools and adaptability. As one interviewee put it: “We need a person who is experienced and young. Experienced, in the sense that she knows the company and the products and stays calm when something unexpected happens. Young, in the sense that she knows all new tools and technologies and is flexible enough to adapt to new possibilities. “&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although this can be covered by a team rather than by individuals, it also suggests that T-shaped profiles will be in high demand in the future: a broad set of basic digital competencies combined with deep domain expertise. Everyone in the future supply chain should understand the end-to-end processes, identify the dependencies, optimize the network as a whole, and stay current on rapid tech advances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, we recommend that in the future training and further training be more cross-functional – with stations in purchasing, production, logistics, sales and data &amp;amp; analytics. At the same time, employees should be trained with technology-enabled learning in the context of work. This includes building learning environments where new technologies, methods, and concepts can be applied and reflected directly in the work process. The focus is less on formal training, but on the ability to experiment with digital tools, to critically question their results and to derive impulses to improve processes and decisions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion: The Supply Chain Managers of 2035&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 2035, Supply Chain Managers will spend less time on routine transactions and more on building and running complex, connected decision-making environments. Technology will act as a true team member – preparing options, executing decisions, and learning from outcomes within clear guardrails. People remain the decisive success factor: bringing sharpened strategic judgment, strong data and technology fluency, a deep sense of responsibility, and the ability to orchestrate ecosystems. Organizations that embrace this transformation now will not only become more productive and resilient but also build supply chains that deliver sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="fdiehlmann_1-1765875977633.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352552iC3158D4A824BA70F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="fdiehlmann_1-1765875977633.png" alt="fdiehlmann_1-1765875977633.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure (AI generated): The interaction between humans and technology is shifting from a focus on transactional data to dialog-based copilots.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This article was written in collaboration with Prof. Kai Hoberg (Kühne Logistics University) in the context of the SAP-KLU study "The Supply Chain of the Future.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Part 1:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-1-of-6/ba-p/14264307" target="_self"&gt;How&amp;nbsp;Future Supply Chain Management Works&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Part 2:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-2-of-6/ba-p/14271554" target="_self"&gt;How Data, AI, and Agents are Changing Supply Chain Planning&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Part 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-3-of-6/ba-p/14277803" target="_self"&gt;Is Artificial Intelligence Determining Future Purchasing?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Part 4:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-4-of-6/ba-p/14282736" target="_self"&gt;The Factory of the Future: Production in the Age of AI, Circular Economy, and Autonomous Systems&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Part 5:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/the-future-of-supply-chain-management-part-5-of-6/ba-p/14286716" target="_self"&gt;The New Era of Logistics: AI and Robotics in Action?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi there,&lt;BR /&gt;nearly 2,5 years passed by and it is still not possible! Today I am facing exactly the same challenge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Requirement&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I need a dynamic structure filter for prior year, based on the actual variable selection. I am not alone I guess! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Current Situation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Still no offset possible. The code is validated but the AM can´t be deployed. Is just checking the SQL syntax I guess....&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="thomaspfab_1-1766055524112.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353532i54EC29465B705FE8/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="thomaspfab_1-1766055524112.png" alt="thomaspfab_1-1766055524112.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Very annoying!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Did somebody else find a appropriate solution?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thomas&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Ronaldo&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There is a way to get info back for a asynchronous RFC (starting new task), but the program construction to make this work may conflict with the reason why you in the first place chose to use "starting new task" - and the programming would certainly be very complicated like a&amp;nbsp;&lt;A title="Rube Goldberg machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Rube&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Goldberg&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;machine&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;You could add a call-back form to the CALL FUNCTION command and in that call-back form you could probably retrieve the spool from the asynchronous task and write the output again. Then the output would get attached to the background program.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Why did you use "starting new task" in the first place?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Kind Regards&lt;BR /&gt;Thomas Madsen Nielsen&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm working on a DataSphere implementation with 5 external non SAP ERP sources. For S4HANA Cloud the replication flows work very well. However, for the Non SAP sources most of them don't have CDC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is the best practice for incremental loading non SAP raw data without CDC enabled? Would it be creating 2 data flows for every table, 1 for a full load and 1 for the incremental load?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are working in an SAP Public Cloud environment and facing the following challenge in the Warehouse Monitor:&lt;BR /&gt;Outbound delivery documents use the same &lt;STRONG&gt;delivery type (LF)&lt;/STRONG&gt; for both processes – standard sales and free-of-charge deliveries. At the outbound delivery &lt;STRONG&gt;header&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we cannot find any field or criterion to differentiate these two types of deliveries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The only difference we currently see is at the &lt;STRONG&gt;item level&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where the &lt;STRONG&gt;item category&lt;/STRONG&gt; differs:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TAN&lt;/STRONG&gt; = standard sales&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CBXN&lt;/STRONG&gt; = free-of-charge delivery&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, there is no way to distinguish them at the header level, and in SAP Public Cloud there is a restriction that we cannot create a new delivery type.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Question:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Is there any way to differentiate free-of-charge deliveries from standard sales deliveries at the outbound delivery header in EWM? Can we add a &lt;STRONG&gt;custom field&lt;/STRONG&gt; or use another approach (e.g., BAdI, extensibility options)? Has anyone faced this scenario and found a solution in the Public Cloud environment?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks in advance for your help!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello everyone!!!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have an SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) analytic story where a &lt;STRONG&gt;story-level date filter&lt;/STRONG&gt; (not an input control) is applied on a posting date dimension.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this story, I have two tables:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Table 1&lt;/STRONG&gt; displays data for the &lt;STRONG&gt;currently selected date&lt;/STRONG&gt; from the story filter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Table 2&lt;/STRONG&gt; displays data for the &lt;STRONG&gt;same month of the previous year&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which has already been achieved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, I need to align this logic with &lt;STRONG&gt;dynamic text boxes&lt;/STRONG&gt; placed above each table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;Table 1&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the requirement is straightforward. The dynamic text directly fetches the selected date from the story filter and displays it with a message, for example:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;“Balance Sheet as on April, 25”&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Month, YY)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;Table 2&lt;/STRONG&gt;, I need a second dynamic text box that displays the &lt;STRONG&gt;same month but previous year&lt;/STRONG&gt;, derived from the &lt;EM&gt;same story filter selection&lt;/EM&gt;. For example:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;“Balance Sheet as on April, 24”&lt;/STRONG&gt;(Month, YY)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The key constraints are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;The date selection comes from a &lt;STRONG&gt;story filter&lt;/STRONG&gt;, not an input control.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dynamic text should be driven by the &lt;STRONG&gt;same story filter selection&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I would like to understand the &lt;STRONG&gt;recommended and supported approach&lt;/STRONG&gt; in SAC to derive and display the previous year (same month) date in a dynamic text box, based on a story-level date filter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any guidance, best practices, or scripting-based solutions would be highly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Not sure, in which version you are working. Private or Public Cloud. Please note for TM integration, SAP expects the PO to trigger an inbound delivery, and the delivery carries the transportation data (route, shipping condition, loading date). If you are in S/4, SAP TM can determine the required route to an in-bound delivery being triggered from PO. On the other hand, if you want this custom validation at PO header level, then, you need to go with available BAdIs&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I am using an SAP Analytics Cloud analytic model with BW Live data. I excluded one dimension member because the cost should not be accounted and set the filter option to hide, so no titles are shown. However, a blank filter is still visible in the story filter area. Is it possible to completely hide this story filter or handle it using some other method in SAC without modifying anything in BW?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Ankit,&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;although you can define overridable fields of type Quantity and String in a price element specification it is not supported in within Subscription Billing. Only overwritable fields of type Price Condition within Subscription Billing.&lt;BR /&gt;If you want to transfer values for fields ot type Quantity or String, then you have to define this in the pricing field mapping for the pricing scheme within the Business Configuration app. In the context of a subscription item, you can use&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Custom references for fields of type String&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Product Configuration for fields of type String, Quantity and Date&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Does this meet your requirement?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Carsten&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I am using an SAP Analytics Cloud analytic model with BW Live data. Is it possible to create a speedometer or gauge style chart that visually rises from 0 to 80 million when sales in August is 80 million, so that it creates a strong visual impact instead of directly showing the value?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;You cannot change the WBS element while the release strategy is active or rejected. You must reset/cancel the release strategy first. With your current authorizations, you’ll need to request the workflow admin or functional consultant to reset the release so you can edit the WBS.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;It seems that when using static actions, even if we use the extension "result"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;static action XXXXX result [1..*] $self;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;it´s not possible refresh the rows after the action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using side effects with this actions in order to refresh a field returns a sintax error "Static action/function "clearSelectedEmptyStreets" is not allowed here".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;side effects { action XXXXXXXX affects field Street; }&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I don´t know if I miss something because, since my understanding, this is a common requirement: to execute an action with all the rows that fulfill a condition.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi Lakshmipathi, we are working on-premise platform application. Thanks for your input but in standard PO(NB) when you create an inbound delivery the transport data (route, shipping condition, loading date) need to enter manually in delivery since these data are not available in purchase order. But in our case, we need shipping condition and route to flow in inbound delivery from Purchase Order without any manual intervention. We also want to calculate loading date based on the route and delivery date in PO items.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please note, data archiving is used to manage data at the end of its lifecycle in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition by blocking and deleting personal data. When the end of purpose is reached, personal data is moved from the database to archive files and is implicitly marked as blocked. Blocked data is subject to access restrictions to prevent further unauthorized processing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 'Manage Archiving Variants' app, choose the archiving object and schedule archiving.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can use the archiving object &lt;STRONG&gt;SRF_TASK&lt;/STRONG&gt; for archiving reporting tasks in statutory reporting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please refer the below help document for more information,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4de200b26d5d42bbacae69c6bf6b9923/cb2ee9a6517f499299e8c03fad46e373.html?version=LATEST&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4de200b26d5d42bbacae69c6bf6b9923/cb2ee9a6517f499299e8c03fad46e373.html?version=LATEST&amp;amp;locale=en-US&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Atanu&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Support - S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Our company with more than 80 Legal Entities uses the same SF System and we were hoping the same seamless transfer for these cases as well. Could you please confirm that it is not working for the transfers across different legal entities? If so, is there any plan to improve the tool for such cases as well?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thanks in advance for any information.&lt;BR /&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Ceren&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;On the UI5 if you set the control to Mandatory then it won't enforce any checks by default. It will just put the (*) in front of the field. But you could only do this in Free style application and not in metadata driven apps.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;As on SAP S/4 HANA&amp;nbsp;≥ 2025, we are able to create http clients as Tier 1 ABAP Cloud compatible syntax. From my research, the unified approach&amp;nbsp; for ABAP syntax that can run on Public Cloud &amp;amp; on-prem systems will require we use Communication Targets. For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DATA: lo_client_proxy TYPE REF TO /iwbep/if_cp_client_proxy,
      lo_http_client  TYPE REF TO if_web_http_client,
      lo_cota         TYPE REF TO /coss/cota_internal.

lo_cota = NEW /coss/cota_internal(  ).
lo_http_client = lo_cota-&amp;gt;create_web_http_client( ).

lo_client_proxy = /iwbep/cl_cp_factory_remote=&amp;gt;create_v4_remote_proxy(
  EXPORTING
    is_proxy_model_key = VALUE #( repository_id = 'DEFAULT'
                                  proxy_model_id  = lv_proxy_model
                                  proxy_model_version = lv_model_vers )
    io_http_client             = lo_http_client
    iv_relative_service_root   = '/sap/opu/odata4/sap/....' ).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Behind the scenes, /coss/cota_internal will be created based on the ABAP version you are running. In our case, I am supporting Public Cloud &amp;amp; on-Prem 2025+.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For Public Cloud - Communication Targets require: 1) communication scenario, 2) communication arrangmement and communication system configuration. This scenario is testing correctly.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For On-Prem - Communication Targets (COTA) are automatically visible in transaction 'APPLDEST' and require an Application Destination be set-up underneath the COTA. For our purposes, we want to create the client proxy to read the local ABAP Application Server, therefore we point the application destination to our own system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AustinKloske_0-1766058991266.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353575iB664AA82195AF2B3/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="AustinKloske_0-1766058991266.png" alt="AustinKloske_0-1766058991266.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AustinKloske_1-1766059028058.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353577iC88F694FFD68A8FE/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="AustinKloske_1-1766059028058.png" alt="AustinKloske_1-1766059028058.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AustinKloske_2-1766059114974.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353578i8E0478DAB0F7CE39/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="AustinKloske_2-1766059114974.png" alt="AustinKloske_2-1766059114974.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The code above to generate client proxies, continues to work for on-prem systems but when -&amp;gt;execute( ) hits, a CSRF exception hits.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Yes you cannot activate batch valuation on standard HALB/FERT in Public Cloud. Copying them into ZHALB/ZFERT and activating batch valuation is the correct and supported approach. This aligns with SAP’s extensibility model for Public Cloud and is safe for future releases (like 2508).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
