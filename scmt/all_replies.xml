    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Building Trust in Supplier Data: Insights from Sean Sollitto of Relish&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In today’s volatile business environment, procurement leaders face unprecedented challenges—ranging from supplier fraud to shifting tariffs and sanctions. In the latest episode of &lt;EM&gt;SAP’s Future of Procurement Podcast&lt;/EM&gt;, Sean Sollitto, Co-Founder and VP of Sales at &lt;STRONG&gt;Relish&lt;/STRONG&gt;, shared actionable strategies and forward-looking insights on how automation and AI are reshaping supplier risk management. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":globe_showing_europe_africa:"&gt;🌍&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Manual Validation Is a Risk You Can’t Afford&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditional methods of verifying supplier details—such as manual checks for tax IDs or sanctions—are no longer enough. Sean cited a startling statistic: &lt;STRONG&gt;84% of companies experience some form of fraud annually, with an average loss of $150,000 per incident&lt;/STRONG&gt;. These aren’t hypothetical risks—they’re real, costly, and growing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The problem? Manual processes rely on hope, not certainty. Automation ensures consistency, accuracy, and speed—critical factors for mitigating risk in today’s global supply chains.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automation and AI: The New Risk Management Playbook&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Relish’s &lt;STRONG&gt;Data Assure&lt;/STRONG&gt; solution exemplifies this shift. By automating supplier validations—covering tax IDs, addresses, sanctions checks, and banking details—companies can monitor risk continuously, not just at onboarding. Daily checks across &lt;STRONG&gt;150 global sanctions lists&lt;/STRONG&gt; and real-time bank account verification in over 50 countries help organizations stay ahead of fraud and compliance pitfalls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sean summed it up perfectly: &lt;EM&gt;“If you can automate a process, you can guarantee it happens.”&lt;/EM&gt; Without automation, risk management becomes reactive—and expensive. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":robot_face:"&gt;🤖&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tariffs, Sanctions, and the Power of Real-Time Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Economic ties shift overnight. Tariffs doubled in some regions this year, and &lt;STRONG&gt;17,000+ entities now appear on U.S. sanctions lists&lt;/STRONG&gt;. For procurement teams, this means constant vigilance. Sean and the SAP team stressed the importance of &lt;STRONG&gt;real-time data pipelines&lt;/STRONG&gt; to update supplier profiles and category strategies dynamically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Knowledge is power—but only if it’s timely. Automated alerts and integrated workflows can trigger offboarding or risk reviews instantly, reducing reputational and financial exposure. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":bar_chart:"&gt;📊&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Trust Through Triangulation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How do you trust the data? Sean’s answer: triangulation. Relish partners directly with curated data sources and banking networks, ensuring multiple points of verification. This approach not only validates supplier credentials but also builds confidence in ESG and diversity metrics—critical for compliance in global markets. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beyond Suppliers: Expanding the Scope of Validation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Interestingly, these validation practices aren’t limited to suppliers. Sean revealed that similar checks are now being applied to employees, contractors, and even customers—especially in industries where rebates or incentives involve financial transactions. This holistic approach ensures trust across all business relationships, not just procurement. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":magnifying_glass_tilted_left:"&gt;🔍&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Future: AI Agents and Proactive Decision-Making&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking ahead, Sean predicts a paradigm shift: &lt;STRONG&gt;AI agents embedded in procurement workflows&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Instead of waiting for triggers, users will interact conversationally with systems—asking, for example, &lt;EM&gt;“Has Acme Corp been checked for sanctions recently?”&lt;/EM&gt; and receiving actionable insights instantly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Far from replacing humans, AI will augment decision-making, enabling procurement professionals to anticipate risk and optimize supply chains faster than ever before. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":glowing_star:"&gt;🌟&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Risk isn’t going away—but how we manage it is evolving. Automation, AI, and trusted partnerships are redefining procurement from a reactive function to a proactive, strategic powerhouse. As Sean put it, those who learn to leverage these tools will become “superhumans” in their organizations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What’s your strategy for building trust in supplier data? Share your thoughts and join the conversation! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":speech_balloon:"&gt;💬&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":red_apple:"&gt;🍎&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt; Apple Podcasts:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;A href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-25-trusting-the-data-about-your-suppliers/id1764078646?i=1000744157727" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-25-trusting-the-data-about-your-suppliers/id1764078646?i=1000744157727&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MelBowling_0-1767820088603.png" style="width: 27px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359218iC0B59C35C9E10AC3/image-dimensions/27x26/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="27" height="26" role="button" title="MelBowling_0-1767820088603.png" alt="MelBowling_0-1767820088603.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Spotify: &lt;A href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EYn1znqijauUaA5hfN9Us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EYn1znqijauUaA5hfN9Us&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello, I am looking to take the&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;C_SEC "SAP Certified Associate - Security Administrator"&lt;/STRONG&gt; Practical (not Theoretical, as now that version of the examination is retired) certification:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/certifications/sap-certified-associate-security-administrator" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://learning.sap.com/certifications/sap-certified-associate-security-administrator&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Does anyone have recommendations on practice materials relevant to the practical version, that are &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;not&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; listed below? (because I am already reviewing them):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All "Recommended steps to prepare for the exam" Learning Journeys/Courses on the webpage&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All digital exercises in each Learning Journey attached (quizzes, step-by-step exercises)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All Live Sessions attached to each Learning Journey (under "Level up your skills" section)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And the following Hands-On practice systems:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://learning.sap.com/practice-systems/exploring-the-authorization-concept-for-sap-fiori-on-sap-s-4hana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Hands-on Practice for Exploring the Authorization Concept for SAP Fiori on SAP S/4HANA (for textbook ADM945),&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://learning.sap.com/practice-systems/abap-as-authorization-concept" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Hands-on Practice for Exploring the Authorization Concept for SAP S/4HANA and SAP Business Suite (for textbook ADM940)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Live Sessions directly recommended for this certification are spread out across several months, and not all of them have recordings of previous sessions. I'm not sure what other Hands-On Practice systems or Live Sessions would be beneficial as there are only two Hands-On practice systems directly recommended for this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for any advice&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;For what it's worth, I post the situation right now.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately I couldn't afford another copy of test environment, so I couldn't get away from Data Ownership.&amp;nbsp; But I found that my user wasn't linked to an employee data that is mandatory with the Data Ownership option.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now I get capitalization automatically without seeing the Capitalization screen.&amp;nbsp; One problem is that the quantity remain empty because it's a value I'm supposed to enter in the Capitalization screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="koichi_ito7_0-1767825522582.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359220i0AEE375356828563/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="koichi_ito7_0-1767825522582.png" alt="koichi_ito7_0-1767825522582.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Capitalization values are populated accordingly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="koichi_ito7_1-1767825576651.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359221iE2DEDE04A13A30A9/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="koichi_ito7_1-1767825576651.png" alt="koichi_ito7_1-1767825576651.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="koichi_ito7_2-1767825599867.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359222iE3AFC3C7B919CB86/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="koichi_ito7_2-1767825599867.png" alt="koichi_ito7_2-1767825599867.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's almost OK but I'd like to see the Capitalization screen where I can finalize the numbers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello SAP Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition (2508)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we are working with &lt;STRONG&gt;item-level discounts&lt;/STRONG&gt; in SD using custom condition types (Z conditions). The pricing calculation works correctly and impacts the net value and accounting as expected.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, when reviewing the &lt;STRONG&gt;e-invoice XML (DRC – Colombia)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we notice that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Item-level discounts are &lt;STRONG&gt;not represented as Allowance/Charge at line level&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;The XML only reflects net amounts, and &lt;CODE&gt;AllowanceTotalAmount&lt;/CODE&gt; is populated only when header-level discounts are used&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;My question to the community is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Is this the standard and expected behavior in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do most implementations &lt;STRONG&gt;model commercial discounts at header level&lt;/STRONG&gt; if they need to be explicitly shown as Allowances in the XML?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Or is there any standard configuration (CBC / SD pricing) that allows item-level discounts to be exposed in the XML without custom developments?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I would really appreciate insights from consultants who have implemented SD and e-invoicing in Cloud Public across different countries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you in advance!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi, Jay, Option A also has limitation. In one project , it will include multiple bid from multiple vendor. So it is not enough. In option B, we use hana vector table. It will increase cost of customer. But it seems in current situation, option B is the reasonable choise. But I think the best is product team fromAI Core and Obj Store work together to improve. Then why OBJ Store? The reason is OBJ store has Attachment plugin in CAP . Which is easy to use . Thanks Jay!</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello, i was hoping to get some advice on, if possible, we have a sister company that does not have an org structure or employees in EC. Through an organisational transformation we have some teams that report into the main company, and managers who will perform the remuneration review within the main company i.e. employee in P&amp;amp;C employed by sister company, report into manager in main company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is it possible to upload a flat file for these employees in the sister company to include them in the workbooks for the remuneration review for the manager?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thank you, Chris, for sharing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;It's been a long time since I last saw an open and transparent blog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I have always felt like this. The best conversations are not on the decks, they are at the bar before and after an event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Do you think it changes over the years? I consider myself still a young professional, but since the beginning, it was like that, no?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1161523"&gt;@MateuszPiotrowski&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Great blog! I really like how you covered all the different options and approaches. One thing I’m not a fan of with Groovy script method is that the error messages show java.lang.Exception and the line number, which can make it look like there’s an internal error to anyone reading it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If external system is calling the iFlow, I think using the End Message step with a custom status is a better approach, since it’s the external system’s job to send the right data. But if the iFlow is just connecting two systems, then using an error exception end should be enough, in my opinion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nick&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Expert,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have a requirement where we need to create an Outbound Delivery even though Sales Order Line Item does not have the confirmed quantity and this is required for our Shipment Planning process which we do manually based on delivery. We were thinking to refer Sales order for this purpose, but we have multi delivery against a sales order in our business scenario.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Learn more about the SAP Support user and program &lt;A target="_blank" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/maximizing-the-power-of-sap-community-at-product-support/ba-p/13501276"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/B&gt;</content>

    <title>How to optimize stories in SAC mobile so that users do not see "reloaded due to memory constraint"?</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've designed a three page story in SAC. For each page I've limited the number of widgets and tried to follow best practices according to help portal (&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/fbe339efda1241b5a3f46cf17f54cdff.html?q=optimize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/fbe339efda1241b5a3f46cf17f54cdff.html?q=optimize&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, I still came across "reloaded due to memory constraint" on mobile apps and mobile web pages. The story can load, but when I swipe, sometimes it will reload. And every time I opens it on mobile, it takes like 30~60 seconds. (I found that for some mobile devices, the story loads faster, but for the other they load slower. But I cannot expect all users using the best mobile devices...)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The story works pretty well on computer, the loading could finish in about 10 seconds.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'd like to ask: for the mobile version of the SAC story, if I don’t want to see the message "reloaded due to memory constraint", how should I control the number of widgets on the page or adjust other content? I’m not quite sure where the threshold lies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Analytics+Cloud/pd-p/67838200100800006884" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="3-1"&gt;SAP Analytics Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Many to many batch derivation/ based characteristics&amp;nbsp; transfer for each sequential consumption and sequential multiple batches&amp;nbsp; based&amp;nbsp; good receipt&amp;nbsp; inside single Production order will have co-relation to track for input &amp;amp; output based properties&amp;nbsp; transfer ag each stages.&amp;nbsp; specific point of time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Suppose Batches : A1 , A2 are there for consumption, starting from A1 Batch of raw material system, consume batch A1 and produced batches are B1,B2, B3 Etc. Similarly from A2 Produced batches are B4, B5,B6, B7 material.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;I suppose to see correlation between them at report level in SAP public cloud that which batches are received from which consumable batches.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In S/4 HANA Public Cloud, I'm developing a custom fiori app that will create a contract upon approval. This app also allows uploading of attachments like pdf files. While transaction is waiting for approval, all information are stored in a custom database table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I know there is a DMS in BTP which allow uploading of file without any business object but client is on a budget and cannot afford.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I understand that API_ATTACHMENT_SRV only allow uploading of file when linked to a business object. But in my case, the business object is not yet created.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm thinking if I just convert the file into binary rawstring and store it in a custom database in the meantime. Then use the attachment api to upload the file and link it to the created business object and deleting it from the db table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;is it advisable to do this method?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;what are the possible implications of doing this method?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This should be possible by a LMS custom report, and maybe even in people analytics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the custom report, you'll need a consultant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Change the standard Title for eg: "Commercial Inv" to "Proforma Invoice".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Add SO10 texts to Fragmented forms like order forms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Adding custom fields like Sales Order Add B tab custom fields to the fragmented forms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any help is truly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

It will be planned for the upcoming releases. Yes, for now you can upload an xsd as local resource and reference it as fault message.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Consider the below approaches&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;1. Manual Reassignment via Transfer Posting&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Use Transfer Posting to move normal stock into sales order stock (special stock type E). Reference the sales order number during transfer so the system reclassifies the stock. This ensures the uploaded stock is now visible against the MTO order.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;2. Backflush / Goods Issue Adjustments&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;For partially closed orders, check if WIP postings already exist. Perform goods issue adjustments to consume the uploaded normal stock into the production/WIP process. This way, the system balances the stock against the MTO requirement.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;3. Custom Cutover Mapping&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;During Go-Live, some projects use custom mapping tables to link uploaded stock to open sales orders. Consultants may run a mass update program to reassign stock categories (normal → MTO). This avoids manual postings for large volumes.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;4. Production Order Settlement Alignment&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;If FG is already activated under MTO, ensure that production order settlement consumes the reassigned stock. Align the valuation class and account assignment so financial postings remain consistent.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;5. Business Process Decision&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;If stock cannot be reassigned technically, consider closing old orders and creating new MTO orders linked to the uploaded stock. This is less elegant but sometimes cleaner for audit and reconciliation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello customer,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regarding your request to update the main IT contact for the Ariba system, kindly know the main IT contact person for the cloud system is indicated in the corresponding cloud contract, maintained by the SAP Order Management team.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you need to change the main IT contact person for your Ariba system, you need to reach out to your SAP Account Manager. Your SAP Account Manager can check the contract information and provide you with the required assistance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you don't know who is the SAP Account Executive for your customer number xxxx, you may contact the CIC team per KBA &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2626344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2626344&lt;/A&gt;. Then please send email to your account manager and provide your customer number, cloud product contract number (if you know it), and explain that you need to change the IT contact for the required product.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since this matter relates to contracts, we at SAP Product Support are limited in the assistance we can provide. Your account manager will review the contract information and provide you with the necessary support.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope the above information helps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks and regards,&lt;BR /&gt;SAP Support&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The error occurs because RTV uses outbound delivery logic, which relies on shipping point determination from SD configuration. The plant’s assigned sales area drives which BP sales area is read. Since your plant is linked to D1, the system looks there, finds no shipping condition, and fails.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>8 Critical Pain Points of MCP in an Enterprise</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is being hailed as the "USB port" for AI agents. But for the enterprise, it is currently a security "Wild West."&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While MCP makes it easy to connect LLMs to data and tools, deploying it without a centralized gateway creates a fragmented environment where security policies are nearly impossible to enforce.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are moving AI agents from demo to production, here are 8 critical pain points:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Attribution Gap&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;AI agents usually execute tools via service accounts. When a massive data export happens, your log shows "mcp-service-account" instead of the human employee who triggered it. This makes SOX and GDPR compliance impossible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Over-Privileged Access&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Most MCP setups are all-or-nothing. A user needing to view orders might accidentally inherit the ability to delete them because there is no granular, tool-by-tool authorization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No Central Kill Switch&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In a decentralized setup, there is no single control point. If a server is compromised, security teams must manually hunt and disconnect dozens of individual agent configurations while the breach spreads.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "Prompt-to-Delete" Risk&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prompt injection is a real threat. Without human-in-the-loop gates, a cleverly worded prompt can trick an agent into executing high-risk actions like cleaning up a production database.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Discovery Without Governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Currently, agents either see everything or nothing. We lack a middle ground where a user can discover a capability exists but must request formal permission before the agent can execute it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cross-Tenant Contamination&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Without strict boundary enforcement, sensitive R&amp;amp;D or executive compensation data can leak into agents used by other departments, violating internal confidentiality.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Forensic Nightmares&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Audit logs are scattered across dozens of servers in inconsistent formats. Correlating who did what and when after a breach takes weeks of manual work instead of minutes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Shadow AI Integrations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Developers are already running local MCP servers on their laptops to test with production data. These bypass firewalls and leave zero audit trail, creating massive compliance holes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Model Context Protocol is the future of agentic workflows, but the direct connection model does not scale in a regulated environment. Enterprises need a centralized governance layer to enforce authentication and authorization before these agents are given the keys to the kingdom.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How is your team handling the security of AI tool-calling?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;含税价逻辑也可以改成：&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;含税价10000， &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;净价是10000/1.13=8849.557≈8849.56&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;税是10000-净价8849.56=1150.44&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;这样就不会产生小数点问题。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;至于代码部分和配置部分更改就靠各位自己啦&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks for the article Sunita, it was helpful.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have question about&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Product History and&amp;nbsp;Product Genealogy Report, was it deleted from SAP DM? I can't see any of them in my version.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
