    <content>&lt;P&gt;I have a CDS view, in which 2 columns have intent based navigation for the same semantic object and action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;      .lineItem: [{ type: #WITH_INTENT_BASED_NAVIGATION,
                       semanticObjectAction: 'display' }]
      @Consumption.semanticObject: 'Material'
      ProductA,
      .lineItem: [{ type: #WITH_INTENT_BASED_NAVIGATION,
                       semanticObjectAction: 'display' }]
      @Consumption.semanticObject: 'Material'
      ProductB,&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The goal is that by clicking on productA and productB, the referred Fiori App (MM03 Fiori App in my case) should be called with productA / productB in the "Material" field.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sorrowfully, the MM03 App takes the product number only if the&amp;nbsp; column name in my CDS view is "Material".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Could someone help if there is a possibility (preferably in the CDS view?) to use the values from columns ProductA and ProductB for the navigation (= mapping the parameter)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/ABAP+RESTful+Application+Programming+Model/pd-p/7e44126e-7b27-471d-a379-df205a12b1ff" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="909-1"&gt;ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Fiori+for+SAP+S%25252F4HANA/pd-p/73555000100800000131" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="623-1"&gt;SAP Fiori for SAP S/4HANA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>This Is the Way: Rethinking Analytics Orchestration with REST in SAP Datasphere</title>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607745164"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Datasphere Task Chains have recently been enhanced with a new capability: the ability to add a REST API Step, as documented by SAP. This addition significantly expands the integration potential of Task Chains, allowing them to trigger or interact with external systems via REST APIs—something previously not possible within the task chain framework itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While SAP Datasphere already offers a Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with its environment, I believe that technical automation—especially triggering Task Chains—should be handled via REST endpoints wherever possible. (Yes, I am aware this is already on the roadmap.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have followed the evolution of SAP Analytics Cloud, you have likely noticed how its REST API capabilities have grown considerably. This trend strongly suggests a broader strategic shift within SAP toward more API-driven architectures.&lt;BR /&gt;Beyond the technical implications, this new feature offers a glimpse into how future data and analytics architectures might be designed. The ability to call external REST APIs directly from within a Task Chain is a small yet significant change—it paves the way for loosely coupled, event-driven, and more modular system landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post, I will explore the broader implications of this feature—looking at both architectural perspectives and practical use cases—to illustrate how this seemingly simple addition might shape our thinking on modern data platform design going forward. The different implications and perspectives I will try to sketch out in this blog post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1411231659"&gt;Integration Perspective&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this new capability, you can invoke a REST service directly within a process step. What could such a REST service do? Here are a few examples:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Microservices and Third-Party Data Sources - Trigger a microservice that extracts data from a third-party system and writes it into SAP Datasphere using the OPEN SQL schema.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Advanced Analytics on External Buckets - Initiate a predictive analytics process after data has been pushed to an external storage location (e.g., a Google Cloud Storage bucket), leveraging external computation power or models.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Endless Possibilities - from orchestrating workflows to enriching data pipelines with external intelligence.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This simple yet powerful feature drastically lowers the barrier for integrating external systems. Especially in modern, heterogeneous IT landscapes, the ability to seamlessly interact with REST services is crucial. As solutions increasingly span multiple platforms and technologies, having native support for REST APIs within Task Chains enables more modular, scalable, and interoperable architectures.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1214718154"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="christian_willi_2-1754304878655.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295957iC56512F19FC536BB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="christian_willi_2-1754304878655.png" alt="christian_willi_2-1754304878655.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1018204649"&gt;SAC Seamless Planning Perspective&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;At present, Seamless Planning in SAP provides only a foundational set of features. However, even with these basic capabilities, it is now possible to trigger a Multi Action in SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)—with some lightweight technical implementation, such as a microservice on SAP BTP to handle user propagation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What Does This Enable?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It opens the door to scheduling planning-related actions that can be executed automatically—daily, during off-peak hours, or at custom intervals—all orchestrated directly from SAP Datasphere. This marks a significant step toward greater automation and operational efficiency in planning processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking ahead, the possibility of triggering a Task Chain from within a Multi Action (either via SAP’s upcoming official Task Chain Trigger feature or through a custom-built solution) would close the loop, enabling bi-directional process orchestration between SAC and Datasphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A Vision of Integration - Imagine this scenario:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Master data is loaded from an S/4HANA system into Datasphere (where the Master data may be managed in the future) and updated in the planning model.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Once this loading process is completed, a Data Action is automatically triggered to generate the necessary planning combinations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Each step is orchestrated across systems—seamlessly integrating Datasphere and SAC.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This evolving capability points to a promising future, where SAP’s tools are moving toward more open, event-driven, and tightly connected architectures. It is a strong signal of the direction SAP is heading—toward building truly integrated, cross-platform planning and data ecosystems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="christian_willi_3-1754304951043.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295958iF2A9C4185F92B9C1/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="christian_willi_3-1754304951043.png" alt="christian_willi_3-1754304951043.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-821691144"&gt;Process Orchestration&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;As outlined in the sections above, these new capabilities significantly enhance our ability to orchestrate analytics processes—in ways that were not possible just a few weeks ago. The integration of REST API steps and the evolving connectivity between SAP Datasphere and SAC unlocks a new level of flexibility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What makes this particularly compelling is the ease with which we can now develop lightweight microservices on SAP BTP to support and extend these interactions. Whether it is handling authentication, user propagation, or orchestrating complex logic between systems, BTP provides a robust platform for embedding custom logic into an increasingly modular and responsive analytics architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-625177639"&gt;The On-Premises Thoughts&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have already referred several times to the concept of a “small microservice on SAP BTP.” This idea becomes especially relevant when you consider that SAP Datasphere is still often used alongside SAP BW, where orchestration tasks are traditionally handled via Process Chains and ABAP reports.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In many discussions—whether with internal teams or external consultants—there remains a strong inclination to implement logic directly within the ABAP stack of on-premise systems. This is understandable. It is what I would call the “home-field advantage”: familiarity, confidence, and reliability in an environment they know well. They’re certain it will work—but the question we must ask is: Will this remain a sustainable approach over the next 5 to 10 years?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The reality is that, SAP’s Business Data Cloud is on the rise, and the centrality of BW in analytics architectures is gradually diminishing. So why not embrace a more future proof approach?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By building a lightweight REST service on SAP BTP, we gain a flexible, scalable solution that can be triggered both by SAP BW and SAP Datasphere. This doesn’t just modernize our architecture—it lays the groundwork for future-proof integration patterns, better modularity, and easier maintenance in a cloud-centric world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-428664134"&gt;A broader architectural perspective&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another powerful dimension of this development is the ability to interact with a broader range of services available on SAP BTP, such as SAP Event Mesh. For example, you could emit an event to a queue and have that event trigger specific reactions among subscribed services. This pattern—similar to what has long been possible in SAP Data Intelligence using simple Pub/Sub mechanisms—enables a much cleaner, event-driven architecture that is better aligned with modern cloud-native design principles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But this blog is not just about the “small” new feature of the REST API step. It is about what this feature represents: a clear signal of how the SAP Analytics ecosystem is rapidly evolving toward the Business Data Cloud—with SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud, and SAP Databricks at its core (leaving SAP BW Private Cloud Edition aside for now).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This shift demands a mindset change for analytics consultants. To remain relevant and deliver robust solutions, we must go beyond our comfort zones and understand how SAP BTP enriches this ecosystem. That includes learning how to build with CAP or UI5, orchestrate processes using SAP Build, and embrace loosely coupled, service-based thinking.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s no longer just about reporting and data modeling—it's about understanding how to leverage the entire BTP toolset to design smarter, more flexible processes that are fit for the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-232150629"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The REST API step in SAP Datasphere Task Chains is much more than a technical enhancement—it is a strategic inflection point. It pushes SAP architecture toward:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Greater openness and interoperability&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Microservice- and event-driven thinking&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tighter orchestration between SAC, Datasphere, and BTP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A cleaner transition from legacy on-prem ABAP logic&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The future is modular, cloud-native, and integrated—and this is your chance to start designing for it.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I would like to know what happens if a module gets deactivated in Provisioning and reactivated again after a year or so. Will the module appear as empty and everything has to be configured from scratch again? Or does it reactivate with the last settings that were in place before being DEactivated. Would be great if you could share your knowledge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you and have a great day.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/32172"&gt;@mohammadshoaib&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To generate offboarding tasks for assets across your legal entities such as Finance or Admin, SAP recommends you take the following approach:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You should set up a “Select Offboarding Task Config” rule in your admin center, with explicit “if/else rules for every legal entity and responsibility group.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;After that, create offboarding task Configurations for each group mentioned above in every legal entity, assign desired tasks to the relevant Responsible Group.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Follow up with confirming that each group has been assigned the appropriate role permissions to ensure they can access and complete the designated tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Finally test these with sample offboarding scenarios and ensure to adjust rules or permissions as desired. Please take note that some tasks might still not generate, if this happens, verify that each If/Else branch is present, groups have permissions, and assignees are properly set.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I hope this helps you solve the issue.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Patrick&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;let me, as the Developer behind Kernseife, answer this:&lt;BR /&gt;Unfortunatly it is not possible to use Kernseife in in ABAP BTP (I guess, that's what you mean by ABAP Cloud).&lt;BR /&gt;The Standard Check we are based on and related objects are not C1 ABAP Cloud released. (and yes, we are aware that it is kinda ironic that a Clean Core Tool is not fully Clean Core compliant :))&lt;BR /&gt;In ABAP Cloud there is a new framework to build ATC Checks with released classes and interfaces, but those have limitations which make it impossible for us to implement Kernseife in it (which is "proven" by the fact, that also the Standard ATC Check for Usage APIs is not using them).&lt;BR /&gt;We would be really happy to bring Kernseife to ABAP BTP, as its role/usage as a Central ATC Check Instance is really nice, but unfortunatly at the moment this is not possible.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Regarding to your exemption questions, I'm not sure if I understand it properly.&lt;BR /&gt;Yes, you can run the check on a specific object (e.g. Class) and only get findings inside that class.&lt;BR /&gt;Exemptions are possible on 3 Levels (Package, Object and Finding), that is all ATC standard functionality.&lt;BR /&gt;But you can't exempt the usage of one object (e.g. Exempt Usage of a FUNC whereever it is used).&lt;BR /&gt;That's were you can change the classificatfion in Kernseife and have it rated differently so there are no Prio 1/2 findings anymore.&lt;BR /&gt;Kernseife is only checking the "usage" of Objects.&lt;BR /&gt;If you mean, if we can use Kernseife Classifications to also allow ABAP Language stuff based on objects, no, that is not possible as this is a different check. Not sure what the Intention would be behind that?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Daniel&lt;/P&gt;</content>

This note describes how to enhance the selection screen for the write program of the MM_MATNR archiving object by adding additional organizational levels (plant, storage location, sales organization, distribution channel, warehouse number, storage type). Are you by any chance familiar with this note? Would you consider it a potential solution to narrow down the archiving process more precisely to certain organizational levels – especially in cases where not all deletion-flagged materials should be processed?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’d really appreciate your opinion on this – and thanks again for your valuable input!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Manual dispatch coordination consumes valuable time while delivery schedules struggle to adapt to changing demands. Legacy systems require extensive customizations that compromise SAP upgrades and inflate IT costs. Route planning relies on experience rather than optimization algorithms, leading to suboptimal fuel consumption and vehicle utilization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The oil and gas industry demands better solutions. Modern distribution networks require real-time visibility, automated decision-making, and seamless integration with existing SAP infrastructure. Traditional approaches of building custom solutions or heavily modifying core SAP functionality create technical debt that becomes increasingly expensive to maintain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SDM: Purpose-Built for Downstream and BULK logistics&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.implico.com/sap-sdm/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP SDM (S4SCSD)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, developed by &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.implico.com/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Implico&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; as part of SAP S/4HANA Supply Chain for Secondary Distribution, addresses the specific requirements of oil and gas secondary distribution. The solution covers approximately 90% of best practice business processes out of the box, significantly reducing implementation effort and operational costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SDM&lt;/STRONG&gt; operates within SAP's Business Technology Platform architecture, maintaining clean core principles while delivering industry-specific functionality. This approach eliminates the traditional trade-off between operational capability and system maintainability that has plagued oil companies for years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-07 at 16.19.24.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298052i5D37DB6362333E92/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-07 at 16.19.24.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-07 at 16.19.24.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Automated Dispatch Management&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system automates dispatch planning by evaluating customer orders, inventory positions, vehicle capacity, and delivery constraints. Dispatch teams can generate optimized schedules in minutes rather than hours, with the system considering factors such as product compatibility, regulatory requirements, and driver availability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Compartment planning functionality optimizes vehicle loading by analyzing product specifications, contamination risks, and cleaning requirements. The system maximizes vehicle utilization while ensuring product integrity and regulatory compliance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Intelligent Route Optimization&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SDM&lt;/STRONG&gt; incorporates advanced routing algorithms that consider traffic patterns, delivery windows, vehicle specifications, and driver regulations. The system creates routes that minimize transportation costs while maintaining service levels. Integration with GPS and telematics systems provides real-time delivery tracking and enables proactive customer communication.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When disruptions occur, the system automatically recalculates optimal routes and updates stakeholders. This capability reduces the manual effort required for exception management while improving customer satisfaction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Clean Core Implementation Benefits&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SDM&lt;/STRONG&gt;'s product architecture preserves your SAP clean core strategy. The solution is based on best practice processes and requires no modifications to standard SAP functionality, ensuring smooth upgrades and reduced maintenance overhead.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customer-specific requirements can be solved using SAP in-app or side by side extensibilities without modifying the standard code.&amp;nbsp;Your IT organization gains powerful downstream capabilities without compromising system stability or long-term flexibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Implementation typically requires 3-6 months compared to 12-18 months for traditional custom development approaches. Pre-configured integration points for terminal automation, tank gauging, and laboratory systems eliminate common integration challenges that extend project timelines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Measurable Business Impact&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Organizations implementing &lt;STRONG&gt;SDM&lt;/STRONG&gt; report implementation cost reductions of &lt;STRONG&gt;40-60%&lt;/STRONG&gt; compared to custom development. Operational improvements include dispatch planning time reductions of &lt;STRONG&gt;70%&lt;/STRONG&gt;, improved on-time delivery performance, and decreased safety stock level through better demand forecasting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The solution includes built-in compliance frameworks for transportation, environmental, and safety regulations. A capability that reduces manual oversight requirements while ensuring adherence to industry standards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Demand Forecasting and Distribution Planning&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SDM&lt;/STRONG&gt; analyzes historical consumption patterns, seasonal variations, and market trends to generate accurate demand forecasts. The system considers inventory availability, supplier lead times, and customer requirements to optimize distribution planning. This functionality reduces stockouts while minimizing inventory carrying costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sales order automation streamlines the creation of quotations, orders, and invoices. The system integrates with customer portals and mobile applications to provide self-service capabilities that reduce administrative overhead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implico Partnership Advantage&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Implico brings four decades of experience in liquid goods distribution and oil and gas retail operations.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is it possible to include a planner name column in compensation worksheet or Executive Review? The field will automatically pull the planner data into the worksheet for each employee, without any manual import needed such as a lookup table. Compensation template is EC integrated and the planner method is rollup hierarchy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+SuccessFactors+Compensation/pd-p/73555000100800000771" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="159-1"&gt;SAP SuccessFactors Compensation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;SAP Note 543279 (“MM_MATNR: Execution for Specific Organizational Levels”) extends the standard MM_MATNR archive object by adding organizational‐level selection fields—such as plant, storage location, sales organization, distribution channel, warehouse, and storage type—to the archive write program’s selection screen. This enhancement lets you zero in on exactly the segments you want to archive, rather than processing all flagged materials across every organizational unit.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In short, how the above note helps to narrow archiving scope is&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Adds storage location as a filter field on the MM_MATNR archiving variant.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Ensures only those materials flagged for deletion at that storage location are picked up.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Lets you leave deletion flags in other storage locations untouched, so only your external warehouse entries get archived.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Implementing the note means your MM71/MMREO050 run can target MARD records for a single storage location, reducing collateral deletion risk.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Key Considerations &amp;amp; Limitations&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The note &lt;STRONG&gt;only enhances the selection screen&lt;/STRONG&gt;; it does &lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;not&lt;/FONT&gt; change the underlying deletion logic of the MM_MATNR object. If dependencies exist (open POs, reservations, stock, etc.), those records will still be skipped by standard checks.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Archiving still operates on the material‐master hierarchy: even with a storage location filter, the object processes the material at plant level under the hood. You need to verify that MARD segments get cleaned independently of MARC/MARA.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Applying OSS notes requires system preparation (SNOTE download, counterparts, transport, and testing).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Extensive testing in a non‐production environment is critical to confirm that only the intended MARD entries are actually archived and physically deleted.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;With the above, one questions comes to your mind; that is "Is it a viable solution". The answer is Yes if your primary goal is to archive/delete only the storage location segment (MARD) for one warehouse, Note 543279 is a legitimate way to fine‐tune the MM_MATNR archiving selection. It’s fully SAP-supported and much safer than direct‐table deletes. However, because it doesn’t alter the archiving logic itself, you must:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Flag your target MARD entries (via MM17/MASS or a custom ABAP).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Apply Note 543279 to your archive variant to include storage location as a selection parameter.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Run MM71/MMREO050 in test mode first to ensure only those MARD rows are processed.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Review logs for skipped records due to dependencies before moving to a productive run.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1387360"&gt;@Ayaz&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for your question.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP’s official help and KBAs for SuccessFactors Public Cloud confirms that it is&amp;nbsp;not currently possible to deep link directly to a custom UI for a non-user-based custom MDF object. The deep link functionality only supports navigation to the standard Manage Data screen or People Profile block if configured for user objects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP recommends linking to the Manage Data screen for your custom object or exposing the relevant access on the SuccessFactors Home Page via portlets. Please note, this will not open your custom UI screen. If you require direct deep links to a custom form or UI, the best approach is to submit an enhancement request to SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I hope this helps you solve the issue. I am happy to help if you have further questions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you find my response helpful, kindly accept the answer and award a Kudos to this post.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;FI uses table TCURX (transaction OY04) to determine how many decimals each currency has.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;For KRW, SAP delivers zero decimals. Controlling (PCA) also reads TCURX—but then applies its own scaling when displaying line items via KE5Z. If TCURX has a stray entry for KRW set to “2” decimals, KPI in PCA will multiply your 82 million by 10^2 → 8.2 billion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;What you need to do is Run OY04 → search for currency KRW → ensure Decimal places = 0 (no entry = default 2; explicit 0 = zero). Synchronize TCURX between your FI and controlling clients; transport the correct entry.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In SPRO under Controlling → Profit Center Accounting → Basic Settings → Currencies, you define which currency types (0 = local, 1 = group, etc.) PCA reports on. If your controlling‐area currency type for “Local Currency” has been inadvertently set to use a 2-decimal precision, KE5Z will scale up by 10^2.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;So go to SPRO → Controlling → Profit Center Accounting → Basic Settings → Currencies. Verify 0-decimal precision for the “Local Currency” entry of your controlling area. Transport and re‐execute KE5Z.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;KE5Z allows you to define scale factors (units, thousands, millions) per report variant in customizing. A variant configured with “Scale = 100” or “Digits = 2” will multiply all displayed values by 100. So go to SPRO → Controlling → Profit Center Accounting → Information System → Reports → Line Item Reports → Define Scaling Factors. Find the variant used by KE5Z → ensure Scale Factor = 1 (no scaling). Re‐run KE5Z with the corrected variant.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;On the KE5Z selection screen, you choose a Currency Type (Document, Local, Group). Selecting “Group Currency” can introduce unexpected decimal handling if your group currency differs. On your KE5Z screen, set Currency Type = 0 (Local Currency), Confirm the Currency Code = KRW and execute and compare to RAABGA01.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;For 1) As mentioned on the page and in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/developer-license-3_2.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP DEVELOPER LICENSE AGREEMENT 3.2&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt; license the resources on &lt;A href="https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#sapui5" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#sapui5&lt;/A&gt; are only to be installed on a personal workstation for offline &lt;STRONG&gt;development&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;but not for running SAPUI5 apps in any productive scenario. This is only allowed on a SAP server. So you would need any SAP onPremise system that contains SAPUI5 to run your app in an offline network.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi expert,&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;I'm new to the Compass. I also research and understand the concept of Monte Carlo simulation. But the question is: If I have a probability, then what to do next? For instance, the Profit is calculated by Profit = Revenue - COGS - Discount, the target for my Profit is 9M and the probability generated by Compass is 55%, so how can I choose Revenue, COGS and Discount for my planning to achieve the target?&lt;BR /&gt;Hope you a nice workng day!&lt;BR /&gt;Regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Hieu Nguyen&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looks like your setup should work, but maybe check some data in the header: usage &amp;amp; status, the validity dates of the group number plans, the lot size of the group number plans, if the material-vendors combination is assigned to the different group number plans. Assume that the DMR criteria in the plan &amp;amp; quality levels will be per material &amp;amp; vendor (to check per vendor which receipts need to be inspected) and not per manufacturer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;greetings, Herman&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/147682"&gt;@hiren_6374&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for raising this issue.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please note that the Employee Central Document Generation does not currently support fixed headers and footers on every page of a multi-page letter. When a document's content changes or expands, the system may move headers and footers from their intended positions due to the way page breaks are designed or implemented.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;However, it is recommended to embed headers or footers as images at the top and bottom of your template. Note that these will only appear once per document and may not remain at the top or bottom on any other subsequent pages. At the moment, there is no configuration or scripting workaround available for true per page headers or footers in EC Document Generation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Consider submitting an enhancement request via the SAP Influence portal if this limitation heavily impacts your organisation. Alternatively, you may consider external document generation and upload as a workaround.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2423967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2423967&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Header and Footer in Document Generation-EC&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/successfactors-recruiting/setting-up-and-maintaining-sap-successfactors-recruiting/enabling-and-updating-header-and-footer-fields?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Enabling and Updating Header and Footer Fields&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/successfactors-learning/managing-sap-successfactors-learning-for-administrators/organization-based-email-notification-header-and-footer?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Organization-Based Email Notification Header and Footer&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I hope this provides more clarity.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;in an Authorization Object in ABAP Cloud the Activities are mapped to one of the three Categories "Read", "Write", "Value Help".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Categories are used in Business catalogs (where "Value Help" is labeled as "F4"), Role/Role Template Assignments, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For Activities there are standard values (see eg onpremise in tables &lt;SPAN&gt;acl_actvt/acl_actvtt):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;01 for Create,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;02 for Change,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;03 for Display,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;08 for Delete&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;03 maps to Access Category Read&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;01,&amp;nbsp; 02, 08 maps to Write&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;But there is no obvious activity value for Access Category "Value Help".&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What activity do you use for Value Help?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thanks for suggestions, pointers to documentation, tutorials, etc!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regards,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; Wolfgang&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Integration Suite and Connection Type G for synchronous BAPIs?</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I have an ALE scenario where BAPIs are called both&amp;nbsp;synchronously (reading data) and asynchronously (posting). I would like to use the Integration Suite (CPI) to establish a connection between the two systems. The iFlows would be a simple passthrough. This is possible for the asynchronous case where IDocs are simply forwarded. Is this also possible for synchronous BAPIs? How would an iFlow look like?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've tried calling a synchronous BAPI with a destination of Type G in SE37 but SE37 does not support Type G Connections. Is Type G supported for synchronous BAPIs in general?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/31660"&gt;@rezadwi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My understanding is that the Benefit Employee Claim object in SAP SuccessFactors is&amp;nbsp;read-only&amp;nbsp;via standard API interfaces. That means it allows only retrieval of claim data but not the creation or update. Employees must submit claims using the Employee Central interface, and claims are then stored in the Benefit Employee Claim object. Please note that there is no supported API endpoint to directly create claims from your inhouse app, nor is there one to store claims in this object programmatically.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For similar automation, you may consider using SAP SuccessFactors Integration Center, custom MDF objects, or certified third-party solutions. However, note that these do not update the standard claim object directly due to system restrictions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can submit a business requirement or enhancement request to SAP if direct API-based claim creation into EC Global is a requirement to your organisation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I hope this helps you solve the issue. I am happy to help if you have further questions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you find my response helpful, kindly accept the answer and award a Kudos to this post. Your support is appreciated.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2024/03/72d228c0-b77e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Global Benefits: A Guided Benefits Enrollment Experience&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1736018569"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Target Audience&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This blog is primarily intended for the SAP Integration community seeking a strategy for &lt;STRONG&gt;routing outbound IDoc flows&lt;/STRONG&gt; from SAP ECC or S/4HANA systems—particularly for those migrating from &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP PI/PO to SAP Cloud Integration (Formerly known as SAP Cloud Platform Integration or SAP CPI)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and exploring effective alternatives to implement the same.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1539505064"&gt;Motivation&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In traditional SAP PI/PO-based landscapes, routing outbound IDocs from SAP ECC or S/4HANA systems is straightforward. A &lt;STRONG&gt;single t-RFC destination&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;IDoc port&lt;/STRONG&gt; are typically configured in the sender system to forward all IDocs to SAP PI. Within SAP PI, routing is managed efficiently using the &lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Directory&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;centralized runtime (AEX)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enabling reuse of a &lt;STRONG&gt;single IDoc destination&lt;/STRONG&gt; across multiple interfaces and message types (MATMAS, INVOIC, DEBMAS, etc).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ShreyasShenoy07_1-1753943278457.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/294339i9CFB79236AC288C6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ShreyasShenoy07_1-1753943278457.png" alt="ShreyasShenoy07_1-1753943278457.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;However, when migrating to &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;, this simplicity is disrupted. Cloud Integration does not provide an equivalent mechanism for managing IDoc traffic using a central gateway or common destination. Instead, each interface often requires its own &lt;STRONG&gt;unique&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;endpoint, destination, and port&lt;/STRONG&gt;, making the configuration effort &lt;STRONG&gt;redundant and makes IDoc Routing complex&amp;nbsp; and operationally challenging, as part of this blog&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt; I wanted to tackle these challenges and simplify this. &lt;FONT size="2" color="#000000"&gt;(* I wont go into the specific challenges of the different approches and rather focus on the problems I am trying to solve in the current approach)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ShreyasShenoy07_3-1753944514940.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/294349iE1B2982CA7BAD14F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ShreyasShenoy07_3-1753944514940.png" alt="ShreyasShenoy07_3-1753944514940.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1342991559"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1146478054"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution Approach:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ShreyasShenoy07_4-1753944610345.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/294350i031118EDBDC1D2FC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ShreyasShenoy07_4-1753944610345.png" alt="ShreyasShenoy07_4-1753944610345.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As described in the flow above, we will implement the design using &lt;STRONG&gt;two iFlows&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IF_SAP_to_Generic_IDOCRouting&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;BR /&gt;This iFlow receives IDoc XML messages from various SAP systems.

Reusability of Integration Flows&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;Instead of creating a separate iFlow for each IDoc-to-receiver combination, this approach separates:&lt;BR /&gt;Generic routing logic&amp;nbsp;(IF_SAP_to_Generic_IDOCRouting)&lt;BR /&gt;Receiver-specific logic(IF_SAP_to_&amp;lt;Receiver&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;Interface&amp;gt;)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefit:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Reduces development effort and avoids duplication across iFlows, enabling a clean and modular architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1058208653"&gt;2. Centralized Routing with Value Mappings&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;Routing conditions and receiver lists are managed through &lt;STRONG&gt;Value Mapping artifacts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefit:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Updates to routing logic can be done without modifying or redeploying iFlows—just update the Value Mapping configuration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1254722158"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Scalable Across Systems and IDoc Variants&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;Routing logic is built dynamically using:&lt;BR /&gt;- Sender system identifier&lt;BR /&gt;- Message type&lt;BR /&gt;- IDoc type&lt;BR /&gt;- (Optional) Extension type&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefit:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Supports complex multi-system, multi-IDoc scenarios without inflating the number of artifacts or flows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1451235663"&gt;4. Native Support for Multi-Receiver Scenarios&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;The use of Groovy logic and looping constructs enables routing to multiple receivers based on evaluated XPath conditions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefit:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Enables 1:n routing scenarios, ensuring the same IDoc can be routed to multiple receivers without message duplication logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1647749168"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Low Maintenance and High Adaptability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;This architecture requires &lt;STRONG&gt;Value Mapping updates&lt;/STRONG&gt; only when:&lt;BR /&gt;- New SAP systems are added&lt;BR /&gt;- Existing systems are migrated&lt;BR /&gt;- Additional receiver conditions are introduced&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefit:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Minimal maintenance effort over time; no need for frequent design or deployment changes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1844262673"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Aligned with SAP PI/PO Routing Model&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;The flow structure mirrors familiar SAP PI/PO pipeline steps, such as:&lt;BR /&gt;- Receiver Determination&lt;BR /&gt;- Interface Determination&lt;BR /&gt;- Outbound Processing&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefit:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Simplifies migration for teams transitioning from SAP PI/PO to SAP CI, while preserving key routing concepts. Also there is a scope for automation where you could write a code to automate creation of Valuemapping. The existing&amp;nbsp; ports can be reused by updating the RFC destination pointing to the SAP CI&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;This approach attempts to addresses the Technical limitations of SAP CI’s IDoc handling, and also supports sustainable growth and &lt;STRONG&gt;cleaner&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;maintainable&lt;/STRONG&gt; integration landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1747373171"&gt;Additional Considerations for Retry and Reprocessing&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Retry and error handling&lt;/STRONG&gt; should be implemented within each receiver-specific flow to manage failures independently for every receiver.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is advisable to &lt;STRONG&gt;avoid broadcasting IDocs directly from SAP Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;, especially in high-volume scenarios like master data distribution across multiple systems. This is due to potential limitations in storing failed messages within the SAP Cloud Integration tenant. Additionally, in broadcast cases, the retry mechanism should support resending only to the receivers where failures occurred, not all recipients.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Exceptions can be returned to the sender system&lt;/STRONG&gt; (e.g., via SOAP fault) so that errors are reflected in the originating SAP system(&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration/sap-cloud-integration/define-error-configuration" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Return Exception to Sender&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;). This enables visibility in transaction logs like WE02/WE05, helping to identify and reprocess failed IDocs more effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Batch jobs in the SAP backend&lt;/STRONG&gt; responsible for reprocessing IDocs should be adjusted based on the new failure status codes introduces by this setup&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1650483669"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog attempted to present a &lt;STRONG&gt;scalable&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;maintainable&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;modular&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;operationally efficient&lt;/STRONG&gt; strategy for receiver determination of outbound IDocs from SAP system by leveraging Groovy script and Value Mapping. Also by decoupling the routing and receiver-specific logic into two separate iFlows, the solution ensures better reusability, easier maintenance, and greater control over message processing.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are using SAP Public Cloud 2502 version, (will be upgraded to 2508 soon), we had a requirement, for sales with order-specific procurement, if the delivery date of SO is Oct.8th, the delivery date of the related PO should be minus 7 days Oct.1st (this is just a sample, the actual rule is more complicated than this one).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, we need a BADI to write some codings, to let us realize this requirement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We checked BADI&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;MM_PUR_S4_PO_MODIFY_ITEM, but delivery date cannot be changed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Could you please how to realize the above requirement, or any other BADI can be used? Thank you very much.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here is the BADI screenshots, for your reference.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Grace_Li1_0-1754640407280.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298209iAC974313E2EFDAE0/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Grace_Li1_0-1754640407280.png" alt="Grace_Li1_0-1754640407280.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Grace_Li1_1-1754640416188.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298210i6B1B6E8536E015D3/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Grace_Li1_1-1754640416188.png" alt="Grace_Li1_1-1754640416188.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Grace_Li1_2-1754640426673.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298211i2D5CCA869907BCD7/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Grace_Li1_2-1754640426673.png" alt="Grace_Li1_2-1754640426673.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Grace&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;we need to be able to generate payment flows to banks from SAP B1 in the UK. We have noticed that there are already some formats that could be used in the payment methods :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAPBPUKOPBT_BACS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAPBPUKOPBT_BACS_TELEBANK&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAPBPUKOPBT_BACS_BARCLAY&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="cambar67_0-1754640032033.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298204i43C9E7B1EABBF422/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="cambar67_0-1754640032033.png" alt="cambar67_0-1754640032033.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;but these formats are not associated with any structure and we have not been able to find it on the SAP portal to download it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;We asked our SAP BO Italian partner and this was their response:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“This template does not exist.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The bank file for SAPBPUKOPBT_BACS is actually an application (plugin .dll), which is only installed when the Payment Engine is installed.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The format is program-encoded and cannot be modified by the user.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It can be found in C:\Program Files\SAP\SAP Business One\AddOns\sap\Payment”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have therefore installed and connected the payment add-on, but we are still encountering errors during execution. Below are some example screenshots.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Barbara Camus&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Add-on payment connected :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="cambar67_1-1754640032035.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298205i3C1925CE81BE2F89/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="cambar67_1-1754640032035.png" alt="cambar67_1-1754640032035.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Payment Method linked to SAPBPUKOPBT_BACS :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="cambar67_2-1754640032037.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298206i1519EDE93D58AB85/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="cambar67_2-1754640032037.png" alt="cambar67_2-1754640032037.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Error while creating file : &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="cambar67_3-1754640032038.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298207i0BC28A63C0B55561/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="cambar67_3-1754640032038.png" alt="cambar67_3-1754640032038.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;After upgrading to Public Cloud 2502, you’ve discovered that MM_PUR_S4_PO_MODIFY_ITEM doesn’t let you change the delivery date field because the importing parameter PURCHASEORDERITEM is non-modifiable. To meet your order-specific procurement rule—deriving the PO delivery date from the SO date minus seven days—you need a BAdI that targets the schedule-line data rather than the item header. The BAdI is MM_PUR_S4_PO_MODIFY_SCHEDULE&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In the digital era of today where digital transformation is every organization’s need, SAP &lt;STRONG&gt;Clean Core Principle&lt;/STRONG&gt; is more than just a word, it's a among the foundational principle for enterprises looking to future-proof their SAP landscape. As per the SAP clean core approach, where technology is moving towards API first Approach, modular architectures, the organizations must decouple their custom logic instead of the application server to external API’s outside the application server layer to ensure agility, scalability, and reducing the upgrade complexity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most powerful enablers of this Clean Core approach is the event driven architecture through &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Advanced Event Mesh (AES)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, an enterprise-grade event brokering solution that supports real-time, event-driven architectures across hybrid landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I’ll walk you through how to &lt;STRONG&gt;achieve Clean Core by adopting AES as the first principle&lt;/STRONG&gt;, laying the groundwork for a decoupled, scalable, and intelligent enterprise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Clean Core Strategy — What and Why?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Avoid Extensions where not required&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Upgrades should not interfere with the extensions and extensions should not interfere with the upgrades&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Decouple the extensions from the Standard&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Keep the custom code separate from the S4 Core&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Clean Code&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Clean Core strategy focuses on:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Keeping custom code, extensions, and integrations outside the SAP S/4HANA digital core.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Leveraging side-by-side extensibility using SAP BTP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Using stable APIs and events to communicate between systems and layers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach ensures that your core ERP remains &lt;STRONG&gt;clean, lean, and easily upgradeable&lt;/STRONG&gt;—an essential factor for reducing TCO and accelerating innovation cycles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In short, minimize extensions, decouple them from the standard, build side-by-side extensions on the BTP layer without touching the S4 HANA Core.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why AES as the First Principle?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To achieve the clean core strategy, event driven architecture plays an important role by decoupling the processes through individual events, following the loosely couple framework and avoiding tightly coupled integrations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Advanced Event Mesh&lt;/STRONG&gt; enables &lt;STRONG&gt;event-driven architecture (EDA)&lt;/STRONG&gt; that decouples the source of truth (S/4HANA, SuccessFactors, C4C, etc.) from consumers (external apps, extensions, APIs). Here's why it's foundational to Clean Core:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Asynchronous Communication&lt;/STRONG&gt;: No tight coupling between systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Loose Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Replace point-to-point interfaces with publish-subscribe models.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Let consumers build side-by-side extensions without modifying the core.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scalability&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Support multiple consumers with minimal configuration overhead.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Clean Core in Action — Event-Driven Architecture with AES&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s take a simple example: &lt;STRONG&gt;BP Onboarding in SAP S/4&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Without Clean Core (Tightly Coupled):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Custom ABAP enhancements in S/4HANA to trigger BP Creation/ Change Events.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Direct API calls or IDoc triggers to downstream applications like ARIBA/ C4C/ Hybris/ External Applications from S/4.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Every new consumer or change = new code or regression testing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;With Clean Core (Using AES):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;S/4 HANA triggers the BP Creation Event via Event Enablement Cockpit.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AES captures the events and routes it to all the subscribers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Subscribers (CPI, CAP apps, external systems) performs the required logic without modifying the core system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;No enhancement. No code in the core. Just events and clean extensions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Common Use Cases Where AES Drives Clean Core&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customer/Vendor Create in S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt; → Event to AES → Update CRM/External apps.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purchase Order Created&lt;/STRONG&gt; → Event routed via AES → Notify suppliers via external systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Material Master Update&lt;/STRONG&gt; → Trigger downstream analytics apps or warehouse systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Building Blocks of a Clean Core Event Strategy&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Enable Eventing in Source System&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use &lt;EM&gt;Event Enablement Cockpit&lt;/EM&gt; in S/4HANA (Cloud or Private Edition).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Within the SAP Application layer, where various types of event triggers are captured, these triggers can originate from the standard SAP mechanisms/ processes like Business Objects Repository(BOR) Event, Change Documents (CDHDR/ CDPOS), BTE(Business Transaction Event), IDOC Creation, Output Determination routines, and RAP based Event Triggers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="HammadSharif1_0-1754319485057.png" style="width: 593px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296161i770BD6E2C3FACA2D/image-dimensions/593x292?v=v2" width="593" height="292" role="button" title="HammadSharif1_0-1754319485057.png" alt="HammadSharif1_0-1754319485057.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.

This blogs explored how the SAP AES empowers the organizations to adopt event driven architecture(EDA) that supports the Clean Core Principle by:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Decoupling the Core&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Separating the custom logic, integrations, and extensions from the S/4HANA core using publish-subscribe event models.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enabling Side-by-Side Extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Leveraging SAP BTP and AES to develop external applications and microservices without modifying the digital core.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ensuring Upgrade Agility&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Keeping the S/4 core untouched allows smooth upgrades with minimal regression testing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scaling Across Hybrid Landscapes&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Distributing business events asynchronously to multiple consumers (on-premises and cloud) with minimal configuration overhead.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Embracing &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Advanced Event Mesh as the foundation&lt;/STRONG&gt; of your integration and extension strategy ensures that you're not only building for the present, but also for the future. With AES, you unlock a Clean Core architecture that is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Upgradable&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Extensible&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Decoupled&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Scalable&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Clean Core is no longer a destination, it’s a design principle.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Need to add a point. It seems its not user specific. While changing the maste data in MM02 I have selected accounting view as Default. Since I got the Issue and others dont. But in MIGO I still have the issue and its recommended as like you&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If the control records for the actual cost component split are missing because you subsequently activated the actual cost component split for the given valuation area without running the startup report FCML4H_CCS_STARTUP, then please execute the report FCML4H_CCS_STARTUP now. Once all relevant materials and activity types of the valuation area have been processed successfully in update mode by the program (check the message log!), the missing control records in table CKMLKEV or CKMLKEVLD will be generated. If you did not subsequently activate the actual cost component split for the given valuation area, then please do not execute the report FCML4H_CCS_STARTUP but get in contact with SAP support!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In some of SAP RAP (RESTful Application Programming) scenarios, there is a need to pass a request body to an action as &lt;STRONG&gt;input&lt;/STRONG&gt;, execute business logic, and return the output in the response body. While SAP RAP offers a "Deep Action" feature to facilitate such requirements, this capability is currently not supported in OData V2.&amp;nbsp; As a result, developers seeking to implement this pattern must turn to OData V4, which introduces expanded support for complex actions and payload handling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog will walk you through a practical, step-by-step session on how to implement request/response body handling in RAP Actions using OData V4, ensuring you can meet advanced integration and business process needs in your SAP applications. Also this blog explains how to capture your OData V4 service in TR Properly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Aim is to create Single Parent Entity and create Deep Action out of it which acts like same OData Deep Entity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Action can be exposed to interface where it can be used for POST Operations. ( GET Can be used only to get CSRF Token for security layer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before getting deep dive into RAP Deep Actions, first we need to understand that RAP Actions are generally &lt;STRONG&gt;function imports in OData V2&lt;/STRONG&gt; and in OData V4 it shows as &lt;STRONG&gt;Action&lt;/STRONG&gt; itself in Meta Data Extension.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Now let's start with the build.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1) Create Root View Entity&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'Test'
@Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations: true
define root view entity ZCDS_TEST_PARENT_ENTITY as select from ekko
{
    key ebeln as Ebeln,
    bukrs as Bukrs,
    bsart as Bsart,
    lifnr as Lifnr
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;2) Create Behavior Definition on top of Root View Entity&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SuryaRamesh_0-1754192998396.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295677i26ED82104B375720/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SuryaRamesh_0-1754192998396.png" alt="SuryaRamesh_0-1754192998396.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3) After Creating Behaviour Definition with appropriate Alias and read only properties, Add Static Action with Deep structure as per your requirement. The syntax is as below. ( Note for the deep action you must create Deep Abstract Entity which I will explain in upcoming points ).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;static action TestAction deep parameter ZCDS_ROOT_ABSTRACT_TEST_API deep result[1..*] ZCDS_ROOT_ABSTRACT_TEST_API;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;4) While using Deep Action, in &lt;STRONG&gt;Result [1..*]&lt;/STRONG&gt; is important which indicates that Action will expand for Deep structure for Result. But for Input cardinality is not required.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SuryaRamesh_2-1754193545159.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295679i695C8F2FFB416010/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SuryaRamesh_2-1754193545159.png" alt="SuryaRamesh_2-1754193545159.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;5) Create Root Abstract Entity&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@EndUserText.label: 'Root Abstract'

define root abstract entity ZCDS_ROOT_ABSTRACT_TEST_API

( Note Service Binding to be created in OData - V4 Web API for Interface Based Requirements and OData - V4 UI for Fiori/BTP Based Requirements. Currently Im creating OData - V4 Web API since we are testing in gateway only ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@EndUserText.label: 'Test'
define service ZCDS_TEST_ENTITY_SRV {

In this Blog we are also going to see how to save/capture V4 OData service in TR Properly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;10) Once Publishing the service, navigate to /n/iwfnd/v4_admin Transaction and find your service Group. Right click on the service and click on&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transport Publishing.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SuryaRamesh_5-1754194630607.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295682i885FD29AA58C44A9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SuryaRamesh_5-1754194630607.png" alt="SuryaRamesh_5-1754194630607.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SuryaRamesh_6-1754194653193.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295683i81AA08C167939D76/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SuryaRamesh_6-1754194653193.png" alt="SuryaRamesh_6-1754194653193.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;11) After clicking on Transport Publishing it will ask for Customizing TR, Save the service in Customizing TR and click on&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;LOCAL&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;system Alias and then select&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transport Routing Assignment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;It will ask for Customizing TR again and save it in Customizing TR. With these steps your OData V4 Service will get properly captured in TR.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SuryaRamesh_7-1754194797481.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295684iAC105F19A6C263BB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SuryaRamesh_7-1754194797481.png" alt="SuryaRamesh_7-1754194797481.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;12) After capturing service in TR, click on the Service and select Service Test.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SuryaRamesh_8-1754194982084.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295686iD8E6854AE734AA91/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SuryaRamesh_8-1754194982084.png" alt="SuryaRamesh_8-1754194982084.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;13) As Mentioned above RAP Action's will be considered as Actions in OData V4 whereas in OData V2 it will be taken as Function Imports. Refer to screenshot below for the same which shows the Action we created as&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Action &lt;/STRONG&gt;while loading &lt;STRONG&gt;Meta data.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SuryaRamesh_1-1754474054639.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297094i81A4C39FD7E67E6D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SuryaRamesh_1-1754474054639.png" alt="SuryaRamesh_1-1754474054639.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;14) Now let's construct&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;URL and Payload for OData V4 RAP Action.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;URL Format :&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"1" : &lt;STRONG&gt;/sap/opu/odata4/sap/zcds_test_entity_srv/....&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"2": &lt;STRONG&gt;TestEntity/&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"3":&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;com.sap.gateway.srvd_...&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;"4": .&lt;STRONG&gt;TestAction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Final URL :&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;"1" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; "2" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; "3" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; "4"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In simple Terms the "1" will be coming by default once you enter the gateway and "2" will be also coming by default once you add the entity. Then "3" is something which is for OData V4 and it's&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;schema namespace&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;which you will find while loading meta data. Finally "4" is your Action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;URL Should look like this:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;/sap/opu/odata4/sap/zcds_test_entity_srv/..../TestEntity/com.sap.gateway.. .TestAction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note : Action should be exposed with a dot (.)&amp;nbsp; after Schema Namespace&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Payload;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Payload should hold all properties from Action Parameters. It will not play any crucial role with Root CDS View Entity inputs rather static action will expect all the deep parameters to be passed to initiate POST Operation in Input payload.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For Our Scenario let's Pass Payload like this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    "Ebeln": "1050001",
    "Bukrs": "001",
    "_Parenttochild": [
        {
            "Ebeln": "1050001",
            "Matnr": "000000000000000001"
        }
    ]
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;15) After passing the payload, we often do get this error while execution which is Authorization block. To resolve this we have to get appropriate authorization from BASIS for Auth objects;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S_START&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S_SERVICE.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SuryaRamesh_2-1754474247987.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297095i422A41B53448611E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SuryaRamesh_2-1754474247987.png" alt="SuryaRamesh_2-1754474247987.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;16) Once Necessary Authorization is obtained we do get response like this in Deep structure in Response body.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SuryaRamesh_3-1754474371255.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297096iA92E7668AA2831C5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SuryaRamesh_3-1754474371255.png" alt="SuryaRamesh_3-1754474371255.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;17) Henceforth with this way we can use Deep Action and pass input in Body instead of payload as deep structure. This could be used for Interface as well as Fiori based objects. In Fiori with same way the testing can be done in Fiori Launchpad with deployed app with Action button having deep structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;18) Static Action should hold whatever Business logic is for POST inside RAP Behavior Implementation class. The UI/3rd party system input can be read from&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;keys&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;parameter with appropriate&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;%cid_ref&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;and once all business logic is done the response can be mapped to&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;result&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;parameter of same action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;19) If you want to read some of the CDS View properties then instead of static action you can use normal action also with deep parameters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;20) If the requirement demands to send&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deep structure as output only&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;or vise versa means then in this case you can avoid deep structure in either parameter or response as shown below;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;static action TestActionDeepInput deep parameter ZCDS_DEEP_ABSTRACT result[1]ZCDS_OUTPUT_ABSTRACT;
static action TestActionDeepOutput parameter ZCDS_INPUT_ABSTRACT deep result[1..*]ZCDS_DEEP_ABSTRACT;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1736822084"&gt;Conclusive Summary&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this blog has clarified key concepts around OData V4, RAP Deep Actions, Deep Abstraction, and capturing V4 services in a transport request. In future posts, I’ll explore running background jobs with RAP and Application Jobs.&lt;BR /&gt;Thank you for reading!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello, experts!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We use drilldown reports for BCS.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And recently we started using data with an active statistical indicator, which means&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;that these items are not relevant to the budget.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;But our drilldown reports don`t accept these ones.&amp;nbsp; And as result they reduce our available commitment budget.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Could you help me to understand why?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards, Hanna&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Lakshmipathi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are currently still on 2SL in S4 Hana Public Cloud. I could not find your mentioned&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;C_SALESORDER_MANAGE_CHECK BAdi. There are some BAdi which we have like&amp;nbsp;SD_SLS_CHECK_BEFORE_SAVE or&amp;nbsp;SD_SLS_CHECK_HEAD. I had the impression that we are unable to call API from the BAdi.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi guys i have a requirement when i have use react as an app in CAP project. Where i have done that and working fine in local development. But when i deploy using manifest.yml&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sharuk6_0-1754641040269.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298218i86123D43F7C91B27/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sharuk6_0-1754641040269.png" alt="sharuk6_0-1754641040269.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;where i want only service to be as separate application so i have build data using CDS BUILD --PRODUCTION for deployment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When deployement is done i wasnt able to call my action and function which are implemented in Service.js .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sharuk6_1-1754641145113.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298224iDB71701EBA28F73F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sharuk6_1-1754641145113.png" alt="sharuk6_1-1754641145113.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;i am repeating again everything is working fine in the local development. and i would deploy React app as static_buildpack as separate applicaiton and use this service of app there.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there anything i have missed?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks &amp;amp; Regards&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607864142"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;ISO 20022 includes data elements to capture additional information regarding the parties (entities and persons) involved in the transaction. Each party’s name and address is defined in a granular structure that distinguishes ‘Name’ and the various components of address – ‘Building Number’, ‘Street’, ‘Town’, ‘Country’ (code), etc. &lt;I&gt;(see table below)&lt;/I&gt;. In MT, a name and address are represented by four lines each of 35 characters, either in an unstructured format or with a structure that distinguishes only name, country code, city and other details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Michal_Pandoscak_0-1754570461290.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297985i85AEB6B5E7F3AB84/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Michal_Pandoscak_0-1754570461290.png" alt="Michal_Pandoscak_0-1754570461290.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1411350637"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Unstructured&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;address version&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; will end on Nov 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Due to the coexistence period of both ISO 20022 and MT formats, in cross-border payments, current practices will be accommodated. Until &lt;STRONG&gt;November 2025, ECP&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;usage guidelines allows both, structured and unstructured address, to be used in a mutually exclusive way, i.e., either unstructured address in the ‘Address Line’ element or structured address in the dedicated tags can be used&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Michal_Pandoscak_1-1754570502749.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297987i573B7E3635AA4E24/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Michal_Pandoscak_1-1754570502749.png" alt="Michal_Pandoscak_1-1754570502749.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Given that as of November 2025 payments must be initiated using structured ISO 20022 party addresses, this may represent a challenge for the corporates that maintain address data elements of their customers, suppliers and counterparties in an unstructured database&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Michal_Pandoscak_2-1754570516426.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297988i26B616E514443709/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Michal_Pandoscak_2-1754570516426.png" alt="Michal_Pandoscak_2-1754570516426.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1214837132"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hybrid address version&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The hybrid address version is a mix of structured and unstructured address details. It allows the combination of structured ISO 20022 address elements and up to two lines of 70 characters of unstructured “Address Line” . Elements available in a structured format must be mapped into the respective structured address elements. &lt;STRONG&gt;The structured elements “Country&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;” &amp;lt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ctry&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;and “Town Name&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;” &amp;lt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TwnNm&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;are mandatory. &lt;/STRONG&gt;Content of structured elements cannot be repeated in the &amp;lt;AdrLine&amp;gt; elements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Michal_Pandoscak_3-1754570548147.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297989i52F9C3BFD171EFC1/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Michal_Pandoscak_3-1754570548147.png" alt="Michal_Pandoscak_3-1754570548147.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1018323627"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Structured addresses in SAP delivered mappings&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="0" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP delivers format mapping templates which implement only the structured address version for formats based on ISO20022’s 2019 version .&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;PAIN.001.001.09 and PAIN.008.001.08&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All sub-tags of &amp;lt;PstlAdr&amp;gt; are defined* for later use in custom copies as shown on the right side.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/91005"&gt;@lindseym1&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The best way is to leverage the provided capabilities provided. I suggest you take the following steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, make use of the Intelligent Services Center to detect termination events immediately after they are saved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then, create a business rule on the Job Information entity that will trigger the termination event and activate Intelligent Services Center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Follow up with setting up a notification or workflow which you link to this Intelligent Services Center event which sends an email to the employee’s personal email address.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Subsequently, make use of the SAP SuccessFactors Document Generation to create the desired legal notice PDF and attach it to the email notification.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, make sure the email template includes the PDF attachment and is triggered with timing “When event is published,”. This will ensure it sends immediately post-termination.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach will enable you leverage standard SuccessFactors capabilities, whilst ensuring compliance and automation without requiring any manual intervention.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I hope this helps you solve the issue. I am happy to help if you have further questions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you find my response helpful, kindly accept the answer and award a Kudos to this post. Your support is appreciated.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/successfactors-employee-central/implementing-global-benefits/01bc658592c1474aa6c0d4a2ca14ba09.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Configuring Intelligent Services Center (ISC) for Termination&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/human-capital-management-q-a/send-email-notification-of-termination-of-an-employee-to-a-group-of-5/qaq-p/12452546" target="_blank"&gt;send email notification of termination of an employee to a group of 5 people?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In Public Cloud you extend business logic via the Custom Logic – Manage Business Add-Ins Fiori app. For sales-order save-time checks, SAP delivers a purpose-built Cloud BAdI: C_SALESORDER_MANAGE_CHECK (Interface IF_C_SALESORDER_MANAGE_CHECK). This is the only supported hook that fires just before the order is committed, and it lets you raise error messages to block a save.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In your Public Cloud tenant, open the Fiori launchpad and find Custom Logic – Manage Business Add-Ins. Filter by Application or Business Context “Manage Sales Orders” (or search for “SALESORDER”). You’ll see the entry C_SALESORDER_MANAGE_CHECK. Create a new implementation, give it a name/description, and click into the check method. Write your validation logic in the guided editor (no ADT/SE19 coding).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Typical steps in your check method:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Read the order header + items from the BAdI’s importing parameters.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;For each item, call the standard billing-plan API (e.g. service /API_SALESORDERBILLINGPLAN or any published function) to fetch and sum the plan amounts.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Compare the sum to the item’s net-value.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;If the plan total exceeds net, use the BAdI’s ADD_MESSAGE API to post an error (message class V4-135).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;When we're running production we sometimes have products which are still in a buffer somewhere in the production line. There is no possibility to take out the product since they are still conform specs, its a physical situation. Problem is, this messes up the dashboarding and OEE calculation. We therefor want to digitally move the product temporary to another resource.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When we use a special routing for this, while the product is active on resource X, the problem is it cannot be returned to the original activity by any other user than the user who placed it in the buffer. We want to build a PPD to activate the product again. This is not working. What needs to happen is that the product is signed off BEFORE it is moved to the buffer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can achieve this by doing a business rule&amp;nbsp; SFC start operation activity &amp;gt; before event. but this is DEPRICATED&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Ruudvandeven_0-1754641297985.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298229i0B3D506A64D1278B/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Ruudvandeven_0-1754641297985.png" alt="Ruudvandeven_0-1754641297985.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Were looking into different routings and see an option called rework loops. This looks like a good option, see SAP documentation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Ruudvandeven_1-1754641903262.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298250i3546F796CA97BFA5/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Ruudvandeven_1-1754641903262.png" alt="Ruudvandeven_1-1754641903262.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;in our situation, the return can happen to ANY operation activity. We designed this, example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Ruudvandeven_2-1754641954990.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298252i651C7FF7FA321B8E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Ruudvandeven_2-1754641954990.png" alt="Ruudvandeven_2-1754641954990.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But upon save we get the following error:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Ruudvandeven_3-1754641980455.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298253iF18C57381E4BBA2F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Ruudvandeven_3-1754641980455.png" alt="Ruudvandeven_3-1754641980455.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Does anyone know how to tackle this?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Experts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Does anyone have a resource/blog which will guide for accessing a Successfactors API from a SAP CAP application by using oAuth2 authentication method. Previously the approach was to use Username and Password, but that is being deprecated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So to move towards the oAuth2 related authentication, i would like to know the steps that needs to be taken from SF admin center and also the steps needs to implemented in a CAP application to access this API based on this oAuth2 credentials. Kindly help. Thanks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/53"&gt;@qmacro&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;: Kindly extend your help. Thanks.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In note&amp;nbsp;3097733 - ActiveX Settings requirements for the EPM Add-in, it is stated that SAP requires ActiveX for the EPM Add-in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are no dates given for when SAP plans to change the technology. Is there a known replacement date for Active-X controls?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm just getting started with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; through the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Learning platform&lt;/STRONG&gt;. I'm really excited to learn, but I'm not sure what areas I should prioritize as a beginner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Could anyone kindly guide me on what &lt;STRONG&gt;key topics or skills&lt;/STRONG&gt; I should focus on first? Also, are there any &lt;STRONG&gt;small practice projects or real-world scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt; that you recommend for someone new?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’d really appreciate any &lt;STRONG&gt;advice or tips&lt;/STRONG&gt; from your experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you in advance! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":folded_hands:"&gt;🙏&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;— Saikiran.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;Hello from the SAP B-Lab team! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":waving_hand:"&gt;👋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;We have been tinkering, testing, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible by combining SAP’s rock-solid master-data backbone with the Perplexity API’s limitless knowledge from across the web.&lt;BR /&gt;Imagine having your ERP enriched not just by internal history, but by real-time insights, market signals, and context you never had before.&lt;BR /&gt;The result? Faster decisions, fewer data gaps, and a seriously impressive ROI. Ready to dive in? Let’s go! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":collision:"&gt;💥&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1861406148"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Smart Master-Data Enrichment: Fill the Gaps Instantly &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":hammer_and_wrench:"&gt;🛠&lt;/span&gt;️&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":light_bulb:"&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;When you onboard a new customer or supplier, missing fields are the bane of every data steward’s existence. By tapping Perplexity’s API, SAP can:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Auto-populate address verification&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, corporate hierarchies, and industry codes from trusted online sources.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suggest contact persons&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; and roles by crawling company websites and social profiles.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Flag inconsistencies&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; in real time, so your team intervenes only when human judgment really matters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ROI boost:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; Slash manual data-entry by up to 70%, speed up onboarding by days, and reduce errors that can cost thousands in mis-shipments or compliance penalties.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1664892643"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Dynamic Supplier Risk Monitoring: Stay Ahead of the Curve &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":warning:"&gt;⚠️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":chart_increasing:"&gt;📈&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Global supply chains are unpredictable. Combine SAP’s supplier master data with Perplexity’s real-time news &amp;amp; market alerts to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatically surface negative press&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; or ESG warnings about a supplier.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Track geopolitical events&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; that might disrupt shipments.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Receive risk-scoring enrichments&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; based on financial health, litigation records, and sentiment analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ROI boost:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; Proactively switch to safer partners, reduce expedited-shipping costs, and avoid disruption-related penalties.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1468379138"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Market-Driven Pricing Optimization: Win Every Bid &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":money_bag:"&gt;💰&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":trophy:"&gt;🏆&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Pricing strategies need to reflect market realities today, not last quarter. By bringing Perplexity into your procurement cockpit, you can:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fetch live commodity prices&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; (steel, oil, grain) and factor them into purchase-order simulations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benchmark competitor pricing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; for similar products or services.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Run “what-if” cost-impact analyses&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; instantly, with data sourced from vendor websites, trading platforms, and news feeds.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ROI boost:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; Improve margin by up to 5% through smarter sourcing decisions, and negotiate better contracts with real data at your fingertips.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1271865633"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Hyper-Personalized Customer Insights: Speak Their Language &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":handshake:"&gt;🤝&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":bar_chart:"&gt;📊&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Your sales team knows accounts from your CRM but what about their current priorities, recent funding rounds, or leadership moves? Use Perplexity to:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Aggregate the latest press releases&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, blog posts, and social-media buzz around key accounts.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summarize industry trends&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; that impact each customer’s business.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Recommend tailored upsell or cross-sell opportunities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; based on new initiatives or partnerships.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ROI boost:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; Increase deal-closure rates by arming reps with the freshest talking points and truly relevant value propositions.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1075352128"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Automated Compliance &amp;amp; Document Summaries: One-Click Briefings &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":balance_scale:"&gt;⚖️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":page_facing_up:"&gt;📄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Regulations are complex and ever-changing.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Brian,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;generally, it is possible to use an online backup to set-up / initialize the HADR standby database.'&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5.x?topic=availability-initializing-hadr" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5.x?topic=availability-initializing-hadr&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;"The general procedure is to take a backup of the primary, restore it to the standby, set various HADR configuration parameters, and then issue the START HADR command. &lt;STRONG&gt;The backup of the primary can be an online backup.&lt;/STRONG&gt; "&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;However, the potential challenge may come with the (remote) catchup phase of the standby and replay of logs. The standby needs to handle both catching up with the logs generated since the backup finished up to the current point in time,&amp;nbsp; while the primary continues to produce workload which also needs to be replayed. Your standby needs to be capable of handling the workload and be able to catch up faster than the primary generates new logs. This is highly dependent on your specific environment, e.g. the sizing of the HADR standby environment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I recommend to start building your HADR standby as soon as possible after the backup finished to minimize above mentioned replay and - if possible - use a time of reduced production workload (e.g. a weekend).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Note that above would basically be true for an offline backup, too (unless you stop production during the whole process).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Hope this helps, Hans-Juergen&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1448673"&gt;@user116&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question. I will walk you through the possibilities available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please note, for fields defined as picklists, you are required to use the internal numeric optionId and not the picklist label in the import file. If you choose to use a label such as "Germany” the system will not map it correctly and the field will appear blank in the employee profile. That my trigger the Location field to behave differently due to its specific configuration. The standard practice requires optionIds for all picklist fields.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To avoid blanks in the file, please export the picklists to obtain the correct option-Ids and use those in your import file. Also, make sure you remove any commas in optionIds before importing it.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Even if your client does not have Employee Central, the system or integration expects optionId for picklist fields during your import.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I hope this provides more clarity. I am happy to help if you have further questions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you find my response helpful, kindly accept the answer and award a Kudos to this post. Your support is appreciated.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hello team!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Is there any way, within a calendar process — more specifically in a general task — to specify exactly which page I want to plan in a story? For example, the story has 3 pages, and it always opens the first one when I open the task through the calendar, but I want to plan the 3rd page.&lt;BR /&gt;Is there a way to have it automatically open on the 3rd page when I click on the task?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Walter,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;it looks like CRM replication is activated. Unfortunately I'm not quite sure where CRM replication is switched on. Maybe there is someone else in the community who can help.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards&lt;BR /&gt;Andi&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Experts,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;in SAP Business One 10.0 FP 2411 - MS SQL,&amp;nbsp; when adding a Journal Voucher (table OBTF), the AutoKey in ONNM for ObjectCode = 28 does not increment by +1 upon completing the operation. As a result, the next insertion attempt reuses the same BatchNum, causing the following error:&lt;BR /&gt;“This entry already exists in the following tables ‘Document with provisional postings’ (OBTF) (ODBC-2035) [Message 131-183]”.&lt;BR /&gt;The issue is temporarily resolved by manually aligning ONNM.AutoKey or restoring document numbering, but it reoccurs afterwards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Can you help&amp;nbsp; me?&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Thanks in advance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards&lt;/P&gt;</content>
