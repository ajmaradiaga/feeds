    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Experts,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Issue:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The goal is to exclude "Suggested Roles" that are lower than the current role.&amp;nbsp; We are not on EC&amp;nbsp; and not using jobClassification.&amp;nbsp; Our role hierarchy is defined using the jobCode field.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm configuring in the Career Worksheet XML the following switch: switch for="filter-low-level-roles-by-pay-grade" value="on" &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;switch&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is it possible to use the jobCode in place of pay-grade for this switch. I tried it but it didn't seem to work and would like confirmation that payGrade is only the field that can be used for this switch to work in the Career Worksheet and/or if other workarounds are possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Again, the goal is to show suggested roles that are on the same level or higher (but not lower level job roles).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;GayeBo&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our longstanding SAP partner, Westernacher Business Management Consulting GmbH, was recently certified for the first time for SAP S/4HANA solution operations. In this interview, Martin Espenschied, Global Practice Lead Continuous Improvement &amp;amp; AMS at Westernacher, reflects on their motivation for pursuing the certification, their experience during the audit, and how the achievement strengthens their global positioning within the SAP ecosystem. He also shares how they support customers across the full SAP transformation lifecycle - from strategy and implementation to operations and continuous improvement. As a globally active SAP consulting leader, Westernacher discusses its evolving 30-year partnership with SAP and the milestones that have shaped its journey. A key focus is the company’s expanding role in cloud transformation, including S/4HANA Cloud migrations, process optimization with SAP Signavio, lifecycle management with SAP Cloud ALM, and innovation enablement via SAP BTP. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Could you start by telling us about your company and the services you offer?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Westernacher Consulting is an internationally operating consulting group for business and information technologies. Since 1969, we have been supporting well-known businesses globally and locally in realizing their vision. We help achieve business and SAP strategies through established experience in a variety of industries, as well as proven competency in the areas of Digital Transformation, Warehouse, Yard and Transport Logistics, Enterprise Management, Supply Chain Planning, Industry 4.0 &amp;amp; Internet of Things, Business Analytics, and Client Engagement &amp;amp; Commerce.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Today, Westernacher operates as one of the leading SAP partners worldwide and is fully owned by its employees. We focus on quality, sustainability, and long-term relationships with our business partners.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Westernacher’s core strengths are best-practice processes and SAP consulting, combining innovative technologies with integrated solutions that enable clients to execute their business strategy holistically.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our service portfolio spans the entire lifecycle of SAP-driven transformation - from early strategy to daily operations. This includes pre-project assessments and feasibility studies, global rollouts and SAP implementations (including custom developments), process consulting and enterprise architecture, as well as project and change management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At Westernacher, Application Management Services (AMS) and Continuous Improvement form a comprehensive, forward-looking framework that supports and enhances SAP S/4HANA and connected landscapes. Our AMS offering goes far beyond traditional support. We provide end-to-end SAP operations for SAP S/4HANA and connected landscapes, covering incident, request, and problem management supported by proactive monitoring. We ensure safe and efficient change cycles through structured release and test management. In addition, our continuous improvement approach connects operational insights with business KPIs and clean-core principles to deliver measurable value. Governance and SLA-driven service delivery are supported by SAP Cloud ALM as a central platform for transparency, automation, and lifecycle management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As an SAP partner for almost 30 years, how has your partnership evolved, and what have been the most significant milestones or highlights in your collaboration with SAP?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Westernacher has been an SAP partner for almost three decades, and this collaboration has evolved from early ERP implementations to delivering next-generation cloud solutions and managed services. Some of the most significant milestones include:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1990s – Early SAP ERP Expertise&lt;BR /&gt;We began with SAP R/3 implementations, transforming the IT landscape of big German companies, and building deep process knowledge in Finance, Logistics, and Supply Chain.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2000s – Global Expansion &amp;amp; Industry Leadership&lt;BR /&gt;Westernacher grew internationally, supporting complex global rollouts and becoming recognized for best-practice process consulting.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2010s – Innovation &amp;amp; Digital Transformation&lt;BR /&gt;We embraced SAP HANA, took part in the very first EWM implementation, and pioneered in EWM, TM, and YL across the globe, helping customers modernize operations and integrate advanced automation into their SAP solutions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2020s – Cloud &amp;amp; Continuous Improvement&lt;BR /&gt;Today, we are an SAP Gold Partner delivering S/4HANA cloud solutions leveraging SAP Signavio for process mining and optimization and LeanIX for enterprise architecture transparency and impact analysis, ensuring controlled change and innovation. All supported by our Application Management Services (AMS) with a strong focus on continuous improvement and clean-core principles. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Certifications &amp;amp; Recognitions&lt;BR /&gt;We achieved SAP Partner Center of Expertise (PCoE) certification and SAP Operations Partner Certification for SAP S/4HANA, validating our ability to run and improve SAP landscapes at scale.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP is strongly focusing on the cloud and encourages partners to support customers in their migration journey. Do you plan to further expand your cloud-related services, and how are you already helping customers in this area?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cloud is at the center of our strategy, and we are continuously expanding our cloud-related services to help customers accelerate their transformation journey. Our approach combines technical expertise, governance, and business process optimization to ensure migrations deliver real business value - not just infrastructure change.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In practice, we are already supporting customers in multiple areas of their cloud transformation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We accompany organizations through &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud (Private Edition) migrations&lt;/STRONG&gt;, guiding them with readiness assessments, clean-core strategies, and end-to-end transition roadmaps as part of RISE with SAP programs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A key pillar of our support is &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud ALM for Lifecycle Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;. We implement SAP Cloud ALM to manage projects, operations, and continuous improvement in a cloud-native environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In parallel, we offer &lt;STRONG&gt;Process Optimization with SAP Signavio&lt;/STRONG&gt; to help customers analyze, optimize, and redesign their processes before migration, ensuring fit-to-standard and reducing unnecessary custom code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architecture Transparency and Impact Assessment, we leverage LeanIX&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enabling &lt;SPAN&gt;controlled and predictable cloud transitions&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our &lt;STRONG&gt;Application Management Services also extend fully to Cloud Landscapes&lt;/STRONG&gt; - whether hybrid, private, or public cloud - where we provide proactive monitoring, automation, and structured release management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, we &lt;STRONG&gt;Enable Innovation by integrating SAP BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt; for extensibility and new capabilities, ensuring customers can adopt innovations without compromising clean-core principles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For the future we are investing in automation, AI-driven monitoring, and advanced testing for cloud environments, as well as expanding our global delivery model to support multi-region migrations and post-go-live optimization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With Westernacher delivering services across 25 countries, how do you address the different customer expectations and requirements related to SAP Cloud solutions?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Operating in more than 25 countries means we encounter different regulatory environments, cultural nuances, and business priorities. We address these variations through a globally consistent framework combined with local flexibility:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Global Standards, Local presence and adaptation:&amp;nbsp;We apply a standardized delivery model based on SAP best practices (Activate, Cloud ALM, Signavio, LeanIX) while adapting to local compliance, language, and operational requirements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regional Expertise &amp;amp; Local Consultants:&amp;nbsp;Our delivery teams include local consultants who understand cultural and legal specifics, ensuring smooth communication and adherence to country-specific regulations (e.g., data residency, GDPR).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Flexible Service Design:&amp;nbsp;We tailor SLAs, governance models, and reporting to match customer expectations, whether they prioritize speed, cost efficiency, or innovation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Industry-Specific Templates:&amp;nbsp;Using SAP Signavio process mining and LeanIX architecture mapping, we create migration and optimization templates that reflect both global standards and local business processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Continuous Improvement Across Regions:&amp;nbsp;Our AMS practice runs a global CI backlog but prioritizes regional needs, ensuring enhancements benefit all our clients while focusing on local priorities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You were recently certified for the first time for SAP S/4HANA solutions operations. What motivated you to pursue this certification at this stage of your company’s journey?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We were motivated by two key factors: the imperative to build customer trust and the importance of ensuring strategic alignment with SAP’s vision.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customer Confidence in Operational Excellence:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;As more of our clients move to SAP S/4HANA and cloud landscapes, they expect partners who can guarantee stable, secure, and continuously optimized operations. Certification validates that our AMS practice meets SAP’s highest standards for lifecycle management, monitoring, and proactive improvement. We’ve always positioned AMS as more than “keeping the lights on.” This certification reinforces our ability to deliver predictable service quality, structured governance, and continuous improvement&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alignment with SAP’s Cloud Strategy:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP is driving RISE with SAP, Cloud ALM, and clean-core principles. By certifying now, we demonstrate readiness to support customers in hybrid and cloud-native environments, leveraging tools like SAP Cloud ALM, SAP Signavio, and SAP LeanIX for process optimization and lifecycle transparency. The certification sets us apart as a partner who not only implements SAP solutions but also runs and improves them sustainably - a critical differentiator for global AMS engagements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How would you describe your experience with the audit? Did it provide any valuable insights or ideas for further improvement?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The audit was a highly structured and collaborative process, and we viewed it as more than a compliance exercise. It was an opportunity to benchmark our AMS operations against SAP’s best practices. Several noteworthy findings emerged from the audit:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Validation of Strengths: The audit confirmed that our governance model, SLA framework, and continuous improvement approach are aligned with SAP’s standards for S/4HANA operations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Tooling Excellence: Our use of SAP Cloud ALM, SAP Signavio, and SAP LeanIX for lifecycle management and process optimization was highlighted as a differentiator.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Knowledge Management &amp;amp; Documentation: The review reinforced the importance of maintaining centralized, audit-ready documentation for processes, KPIs, and improvement initiatives - something we already prioritize but will continue to refine.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The audit also provided several valuable insights that will guide our further improvements:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Automation Opportunities: The audit encouraged us to accelerate test automation and proactive automated monitoring to reduce manual effort and improve predictability.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Global Consistency: While our regional teams perform strongly, we identified opportunities to standardize across all delivery centers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enhanced Use of SAP Cloud ALM Analytics: Leveraging deeper analytics in Cloud ALM for predictive insights and trend-based improvement was a key takeaway.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Overall, the audit validated our “run and improve” philosophy and gave us actionable ideas to make our AMS practice even more efficient, scalable, and future-ready.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="The Westernacher team together with the SAP auditor during the S/4HANA operations certification audit, October 2025" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344251i22086AD3CD4E9467/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Westernacher_1.jpg" alt="The Westernacher team together with the SAP auditor during the S/4HANA operations certification audit, October 2025" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;The Westernacher team together with the SAP auditor during the S/4HANA operations certification audit, October 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Do you expect the certification to support your marketing activities and strengthen communication with your customers?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Yes, absolutely. The SAP S/4HANA Operations Certification is more than a technical achievement. It is a trust signal for our customers and prospects. It demonstrates that Westernacher meets SAP’s highest standards for operational excellence, lifecycle management, and continuous improvement, and supports marketing and communication by:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Differentiation in the Market: The certification positions us as a partner who not only implements SAP solutions but also runs and optimizes them sustainably, which is a key decision factor for AMS and cloud engagements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customer Confidence: It reinforces our credibility when discussing RISE with SAP, cloud migrations, and AMS services, making conversations more persuasive and value-driven.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Co-Marketing Opportunities with SAP: The certification opens doors for joint success stories, webinars, and campaigns, leveraging SAP’s ecosystem to amplify our reach.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New Market Focus: With this certification, we will actively market AMS not only as a natural extension of our implementation projects but also as a standalone service for external clients where we did not perform the SAP implementation. This expands our reach and positions AMS as a strategic offering for any SAP customer seeking operational excellence and continuous improvement.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In short, the certification strengthens our brand promise and helps us communicate a clear message: Westernacher delivers SAP operations at a globally recognized standard, backed by continuous improvement and cloud readiness.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Information on the certification program for operations partners and an overview of all certified partners can be found in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="http://www.sap.com/opc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Operations Partner Guide&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Visit&amp;nbsp;OPC&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/partners/partner-program/certify-my-solution.html#outsourcing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP.com&lt;/A&gt; or on the &lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/partnership/services/co-innovation/opc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Partner Portal&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Pardon my ignorance here, however, after Brexit, I assume a GB Company with DE VAT Registration will need a separate Customer Code with Address in DE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I mean now that GB is not part of EU anymore, I am not sure if GB Company can hold Foreign VAT Registration in EU same way as before Brexit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This mean in your case you will need two separate Customer Codes, one for GB and another for DE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If the Customer is based in Northern Ireland, the case is different...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This is such an excellent explanation. Thanks for sharing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The biggest mistake that abap developers (and managers) make, at least in my company, is to think that RAP is another abap tool, just like ALVs or Smart Forms. They think they can learn this on the go, without understanding how the framework actually works. When they start getting the ILLEGAL STATEMENT dumps they soon realize this is a completely different thing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We have 1 SAP DS job, scheduled every 30 minutes,&amp;nbsp; that hangs occasionally, for no apparent reason. We have to manually abort it, so that it will run at the next interval. I looked at the Windows Task Scheduler for the job, and it shows "Task Completed" after about 1 minute, so the Windows task is not hung. Apparently it is stuck within the SAP job application.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Management Console, the "End Time" is blank, although the steps have completed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any thoughts about how to solve this ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Data Services&lt;BR /&gt;Version: 14.2.13.25270479&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Consultant,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We confirmed the process and moved on to setting up the organizational structure without adding some scope items that needed to be activated in the initial scoping. It turned out we needed these scopes as well. &lt;STRONG&gt;We haven't deployed them to the starter system yet.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Can you activate these below listed scopes for the starter customization system as well?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Accounting and Financial Close – Group Ledger IFRS (1GA)1GAAccounting and Financial Close – Group Ledger US GAAP (2VA)2VAAsset Accounting – Additional Depreciation Area (5HG) Update5HGAsset Under Construction – Additional Depreciation Area (5KF)5KF&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a critical issue for us, and we would be very grateful if you could do.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Learn more about the SAP Support user and program &lt;A target="_blank" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/maximizing-the-power-of-sap-community-at-product-support/ba-p/13501276"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/B&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If the scope items &lt;STRONG&gt;5HG, 5KF, 1GA, and 2VA&lt;/STRONG&gt; were not selected during the &lt;STRONG&gt;Initial Scoping&lt;/STRONG&gt; phase and the workspace has not been deployed yet, you can still delete the current workspace and recreate it with the required scope items included in your scope.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A workspace can only be deleted before the first deployment to the target system. This means the activity must still be &lt;STRONG&gt;Deploying Scope and Organizational Structure&lt;/STRONG&gt; and not confirmed yet. Once this activity is completed, workspace deletion is no longer possible.&lt;BR /&gt;Therefore, ensure that the deletion is performed &lt;STRONG&gt;before completing the Deploying Scope and Organizational Structure activity&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For further guidance, refer to the following resources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3425018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3425018 - How to check whether a scope item is only available for initial scoping in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition - SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3381588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3381588 - How to delete the Workspace in SAP Central Business Configuration - SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/CENTRAL_BUSINESS_CONFIGURATION/55c9333eed324cd284f6c4e5dab8462f/02023ac8950b4b989a7bab5d9ac5b518.html#loio8ec6cb4006084f7c9a4a4b6b0eb75479" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Working with Workspaces | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best Regards,&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1430989"&gt;@Brinda911&lt;/a&gt;, I'm actually facing a similiar issue and was wondering if you got an official answer on this topic. To my understanding as well, we shouldn't be needing variant configuration for the explosion is the sales order from the Order BOM. Best regards.</content>

    <title>Is it possible to capture values ​​in bulk using a CSV template?</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The performance form is configured so that the employee records two or more values ​​at one of the stages (Creation, RV1, RV2, or RV3). However, due to business guidelines, we decided not to evaluate these values ​​during the cycle; therefore, no employee entered them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The critical issue is that the form, as currently configured, does not allow progress to the closing stage if the values ​​are empty, so the forms are stuck.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My question is specifically whether, as an administrator, it is possible to add these values ​​in bulk using a CSV template, without the employee having to enter them manually. This would allow us to move to closing without modifying the business guidelines or returning 1,000 forms to previous stages.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In Business Partner master data, the VAT registration number is validated against the country code of the BP address. If the BP has a GB address, SAP expects a GB VAT ID. If you enter a DE VAT ID, SAP insists the BP country = DE. For DE country, SAP requires a German postal code and address fields. That’s why your attempt to store a DE VAT ID against a GB address fails.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Some standard approaches would be as follows for your output issue&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In BP → Identification → Tax Numbers, you can maintain multiple VAT IDs. The “main” VAT ID must match the BP country, but you can add additional VAT IDs (e.g. DE VAT ID). These can be picked up in invoice output via output determination / smartform logic. However, by default &lt;STRONG&gt;only the “main” VAT ID prints&lt;/STRONG&gt; unless you enhance the output program&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Create a separate BP for the fiscal representative in Germany (with DE address, DE VAT ID). Assign this BP as a partner function (e.g. “Tax Representative”) in the customer master. Then adapt your invoice output so that the DE VAT ID from this partner function prints when required. This keeps your GB customer address intact, but still allows DE VAT ID to be used for tax reporting.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In BP customizing, you can define additional tax number categories (e.g. “Fiscal Rep VAT ID”). Maintain the DE VAT ID under this category for the GB BP. Then adjust invoice output logic to print this tax number when delivering from EU plants. This avoids creating a duplicate BP, but requires output program enhancement.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP IBP has an Application Job to accomplish the standard analytics to your planning area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Application Job name is:&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Import Best Practice Analytics Stories&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Add Prefix of three characters and execute the job.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can modify the Stories based on your clients requirements and scenarios (similar to what we do for Planner Workspace, Excel Templates).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kudos ! if you like the answer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;-Rahul Mohnot&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I am working with a customer who operates two separate SAP systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;They would like to activate BCM for payment approvals in one system, and use MBC in the other system exclusively for transmitting payment files to the bank.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is it technically feasible to configure MBC as a transmission-only component in a standalone system?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any guidance or best practices would be greatly appreciated &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/226639"&gt;@ankish&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;How does SAP recommend handling Review Employee Data for involuntary terminations&amp;nbsp; and Alumni Access?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If a person leaves involuntary and offboarding is initiated, that person is not around to complete the review employee data step which is needed to be able to eligible for Alumni Access.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there a way to skip Employee Review Data or assign it to someone else in the organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;About:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Travis County is located in Central Texas. It is the fifth-most populous county in Texas. Its county seat and most populous city is Austin, the state's capital. Established in 1840 by the 4th Congress of the Republic of Texas, and named after William Barret Travis, Travis County prides itself on improving the quality of life of its 1.2 million [census.gov] residents through world-class educational and medical institutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agenda:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Introductions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Evaluation &amp;amp; Project preparation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Project Execution&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Governance &amp;amp; Adoption&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Interactive LIVE Q&amp;amp;A Session&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Solutions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Travis County has been a customer since 2010 with SAP ERP. In 2017 they went live with SAP SuccessFactors Learning and Performance and Goals. In June of 2025, they continued to expand their SuccessFactors landscape by going live with Employee Central and SuccessFactors Work Zone as the replacement to their SAP Portal. This included using BTP Integration Suite for replication between Employee Central and SAP ECC. They have plans to continue their transformation by migrating from the on-premise SAP ECC system to S/4 HANA Private Cloud Edition in the coming years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Event Owner:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Stephanie Sparck I stephanie.sparck@sap.com&lt;BR /&gt;Customer Reference Manager NA – US Public Services, SAP Global Customer Reference and Advocates&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://events.sap.com/sapccsuccessfactorstransformationjourneyattraviscounty/en_us/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Register here!&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Basis Gurus, We are an SAP ECC application without process orchestration in our landscape. We are using DB2 database. And our need is to connect to external DB2 to read data directly from a mainframe application DB2 database. Our internal DB2 driver version is different from mainframe DB2 driver version.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP ECC...is it possible to have 2 different driver version for a DB. If yes please direct me to the blogs or SAP help content.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am trying to create a user in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; using the SCIM API (&lt;CODE&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;POST /Users&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt;). I followed the documentation from API Hub(&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/IdDS_SCIM/resource/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Accelerator Hub&lt;/A&gt;) and set up my local UI5 proxy, but I keep getting a &lt;STRONG&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/STRONG&gt; error. Below are the details:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="bhavana_rani_0-1764180101876.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345542i22C3C98A0BC44690/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="bhavana_rani_0-1764180101876.png" alt="bhavana_rani_0-1764180101876.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;My Configuration&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;ui5.yaml snippet:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="bhavana_rani_1-1764180188634.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345543i64E0177D35518DD7/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="bhavana_rani_1-1764180188634.png" alt="bhavana_rani_1-1764180188634.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Issue&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;-When I run locally and call &lt;A href="http://localhost:8080/scim/Users" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:8080/scim/Users&lt;/A&gt;, I get 404 Not Found.&lt;BR /&gt;-Direct API call (https://&amp;lt;tenant-subdomain&amp;gt;.accounts.ondemand.com/scim/Users) with token works fine.&lt;BR /&gt;-Seems like the proxy mapping is not resolving correctly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="bhavana_rani_2-1764180298154.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345545i688B050CEDE22BC1/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="bhavana_rani_2-1764180298154.png" alt="bhavana_rani_2-1764180298154.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;My Question&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1)Is my ui5.yaml proxy configuration correct for forwarding /scim/Users requests?&lt;BR /&gt;2)Do I need to adjust the path or mountPath to include /Users explicitly?&lt;BR /&gt;3)Any best practices for testing SCIM API locally with UI5 proxy?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;please guide me on the correct configuration.&lt;BR /&gt;Any insights, best practices, or examples would be greatly appreciated.&lt;BR /&gt;#SCIM #SCIMAPI #SAPUI5&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi everyone, I'm kind of new to SAP and I don't use that many functions but I have an issue with disappearing orders:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If I create a work order, then place an order in the ''Component'' column, if someone puts in time for that work order after this and before purchase check their order sheets, the purchase department cannot see my order, it's still in the work order but does not appear in the ordering sheets so everything is kind of left in limbo.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Has anyone had that exact problem or a similar one, we are looking for solutions because the problem is growing and creating loss of time and breakdowns.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you, I'm not sure if what I said is clear, write me if you have any questions.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please refer to KBA&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0003342696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://me.sap.com/notes/0003342696&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;and content in help portal to know about the apps key features: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0e602d466b99490187fcbb30d1dc897c/de077187a57442ae997bce3bdfc19a11.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=2508.500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Purchase Requisition Average Approval Time - Flexible Workflow&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This behavior is confirmed in SAP KBA 3342696 (Currency conversion error in aging analysis apps), which explains that many analytical apps—including PR Average Approval Time—will fail to load data if the system is missing an exchange rate between two currencies for the specific date being evaluated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Validity: The rate must be valid for or before the date shown in the error message. Once the exchange rate is added, the PR Average Approval Time app will load successfully. Please, set the conversion rate from a date covering all PRs created in your system (for example, from 1970).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Support&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>The same happened to me. I did create ticket 5000252178. Still not solved since 16th November 2025. Did write an email to training center in Walldorf, no replay. Contact via telephone not possible.</content>

    <title>BP user exits to check data before saving (SAP GUI transaction for Business Partners)</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I've read a few questions and answers about which user exit to choose to add custom checks before saving in the SAP GUI transaction BP (maintenance of business partners), but without understanding which ones to choose, how they are all related, what they exactly do. I'm trying here to provide an overview of what I have quickly understood.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm running S/4HANA 2023 FPS 1 (ABAP 7.58 SP 1).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In short, there are these user exits, called sequentially:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the BP checks by the BDT framework (Business Data Toolset),&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the BP checks by the BAdI&amp;nbsp;BUPA_FURTHER_CHECKS,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the vendor or customer specific checks by the BAdI VENDOR_EXTENSION_CHECK and CUSTOMER_EXTENSION_CHECK.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;NB: if I understand well, S/4HANA has merged customer and vendor maintenance into BP, and before S/4HANA, there were specific vendor and customer user exits (not part of BP) which were the&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Business Transaction Events 1340 and 1440 and the BAdI CUSTOMER_ADD_DATA and VENDOR_ADD_DATA, method CHECK_ALL_DATA. I don't discuss them here.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In BP, the BDT checks&amp;nbsp;are first called. You may create your own function module (no parameters) and add it to the transaction code BUS7 for the event DCHCK. For the sequence number, you may enter any two last characters (positions 6 and 7) other than "00" (double zero), because the positions are reserved for custom use, as explained in the SAP Help Portal:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Naming convention: The position number has 7 places. Each development stage has one place of its own. The places from the left up to your own place are freely assignable. The application uses them to determine the position of the view within a section in relation to the views of the upstream development stages. The numbers to the right of your own place must be ‘0’.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The following places are reserved for the development stages:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Application basis 1+2&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Standard applications 3&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Industry applications 4&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Development partners 5&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Customers (central) 6&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Customers (branch) 7&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then, the method CHECK_CENTRAL of the &lt;STRONG&gt;Classic&lt;/STRONG&gt; BAdI BUPA_FURTHER_CHECKS is called. You may also implement it (transaction code SE18, menu Implementations &amp;gt; Create). This method&amp;nbsp;receives few parameters (table BUT000, name, organization data, person data). If you need other data from the business partner, you may call function modules like BUP_BUPA_BUT0IS_GET (table BUT0IS being the industry sectors defined at the BP level) to get the data modified (or not) by the user, before the data is really saved to the database.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After that, if the partner is of type vendor, BP calls the method CHECK of the BAdI Definition VENDOR_EXTENSION_CHECK of the &lt;STRONG&gt;Enhancement Spot&lt;/STRONG&gt; VENDOR_EXTENSION.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If the partner of type customer,&amp;nbsp;BP calls the method CHECK of the BAdI Definition CUSTOMER_EXTENSION_CHECK of the Enhancement Spot CUSTOMER_EXTENSION.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The two BAdI above receive only the vendor or customer specific data, not the whole business partner data, to prevent saving the data to the vendor or customer specific tables LFA1, KNA1 (and so on), but &lt;STRONG&gt;even if an error is raised by the user exit, the business partner data is saved&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In my case, I wanted to define a blocking check on BP data, the most simple way, so I used the classic BAdI BUPA_FURTHER_CHECKS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For information, if you want to know about how the vendor or customer specific data is filtered out from the business partner data, it's done by the class CVI_STRATEGY_BP_VENDOR, in the method IF_MDS_CTRL_STRATEGY_IMPL~PROCESS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I don't know how exactly the BP customizing decides how to display the vendor or customer data, and how it's saved into the tables LFA1, KNA1, etc. What I could understand:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you create a Business Partner, you choose a partner group from the table TB000 (e.g. PCUS, PVEN)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The SPRO activity "Define partner role from client to partner" (SM30 &amp;gt; CVIV_CUST_TO_BP2) assigns one or more partner roles (e.g. FLCU00) to the partner group (e.g. PCUS).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The SPRO activity "Define partner role from vendor to partner" (SM30 &amp;gt; CVIV_VEND_TO_BP2) assigns one or more partner roles (e.g. FLVN00) to a partner group (e.g. PVEN).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The SPRO activity "Define partner roles" (SM34 &amp;gt; BUPA_TB003) links the partner role (e.g. FLCU00) to the BDT partner view (e.g. FLCU00). This BDT partner view is defined in the transaction BUSD and is connected to Dynpro screens with ABAP logic. It's not clear to me how, from here, some BDT partner function modules are called at save time and how they write to either the table LFA1 (vendor) or KNA1 (customer).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The SPRO activity "Assign partner role to client group" (V_TBD001) assigns a client group from KNA1-KTOKD (e.g. CUST) to a partner group&amp;nbsp;(e.g. PCUS). This customizing indicates if the client number is the same as the partner number. For information, the relationship table is CVI_CUST_LINK.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The SPRO activity "Assign partner role to vendor group" (V_TBC001) assigns a vendor group from LFA1-KTOKK (e.g. VEND) to a partner group (e.g. PVEN).&amp;nbsp;This customizing indicates if the vendor number is the same as the partner number. For information, the relationship table is CVI_VEND_LINK.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If I've missed something, if I'm wrong or if you can enlighten me, please add a comment. I will then update this post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for reading!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Temos novidade importante sobre o IRRF. Em 26 de novembro de 2025 o presidente sancionou a lei que amplia a faixa de isenção do IRRF para rendimentos mensais de até R$ 5.000&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. A medida entra em vigor em janeiro de 2026 e deve atingir cerca de 15 milhões de contribuintes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;O que muda na prática?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As principais alterações incluem:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Isenção total&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; para rendas mensais de até R$ 5.000.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Desconto progressivo&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; para rendas entre R$ 5.001 e R$ 7.350 mensais.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Aplicação nas folhas &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;regulares, férias e décimo terceiro salário.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Exemplos aproximados de impacto:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Para um salário de R$ 5.000, a redução no desconto do IRRF pode chegar a até R$ 312,89 por mês (valor ilustrativo — ver observação abaixo).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Para um salário de R$ 7.000, o benefício estimado é de aproximadamente R$ 46,61 por mês.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;Observação:&lt;/U&gt; os exemplos acima são estimativas. A metodologia de cálculo pode ser ajustada nas instruções normativas e notas técnicas da Receita Federal/eSocial. Recomenda-se validar os valores após a publicação dos atos regulamentares.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Impactos nos Sistemas de Folha de Pagamento?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Essa alteração exigirá adaptações em todos os processos de processamento de folha:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Nova lógica após o cálculo pela tabela progressiva atual.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Aplicação de fórmula específica para a faixa intermediária.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ajustes também para férias e 13º salário.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Posicionamento da SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A SAP já está analisando a legislação desde a aprovação no Senado. Aguardamos as publicações finais (Instrução Normativa da RFB, Nota Técnica do eSocial, etc.) para apresentar um plano definitivo de entrega e orientações técnicas.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Onde acompanhar as atualizações?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Vocês podem acompanhar este tópico no &lt;EM&gt;Regulatory Change Manager&lt;/EM&gt; através do link: &lt;A href="https://app.main.regulatory-change-manager.cloud.sap/index.html#/detail/GSREQAMER-15494" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://app.main.regulatory-change-manager.cloud.sap/index.html#/detail/GSREQAMER-15494&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;IMPORTANTE:&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;As regulamentações adicionais podem alterar detalhes técnicos e impactos operacionais. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reforçamos que as alterações legais que impactam a localização de folha de pagamento para o Brasil são disponibilizadas no &lt;EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://app.main.regulatory-change-manager.cloud.sap/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Regulatory Change Manager&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Gostou desse post?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;One of the most frequent topics customers seek guidance on is how they can tailor their business documents to reflect their unique brand and operational needs. While the standard forms we deliver are a fantastic starting point, your billing document is a key touchpoint with your customers, and it needs to be just right.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Today, I’m going to walk you through a practical, step-by-step guide on how to extend the standard billing document form template to meet some of the most common business requirements. We'll cover adding your company logo, including standard and custom fields, adding static text, and even generating multiple copies such as customer copy or archive copy of a single invoice.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Let’s get started!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Core Tools of the Trade&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Before we dive into the details, let's familiarize ourselves with the key applications and tools we will be using in the SAP Fiori launchpad:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1. &lt;STRONG&gt;Maintain Form Templates App:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is your central hub for managing all form templates. Here, you can copy standard templates, download the layout files, upload your modified versions, and activate them.&lt;BR /&gt;2. &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Fields App&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A powerful application that allows you to create your own business-specific fields and make them available in various business contexts, including form templates.&lt;BR /&gt;3. &lt;STRONG&gt;Output Parameter Determination App&lt;/STRONG&gt;: After you have a beautiful new form, this app is where you define the business rules that tell the system when to use it (e.g., for a specific company code, sales organization, or customer).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adobe LiveCycle Designer:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is the design tool used to edit the visual layout of the form. You will need to have it installed on your local machine (available via app &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/c5018d7883d04429bb43baad408ee333.html?version=LATEST&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Install Additional Software&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1: Create Your Custom Form Template&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP delivers default form templates that you can copy to create your own custom form templates&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1. Open the &lt;STRONG&gt;Maintain Form Templates&lt;/STRONG&gt; app, and navigate to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Predelivered Templates&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab..&lt;BR /&gt;2. Search for SDBIL_CI_STANDARD* to find the standard templates for customer invoices.You will see localized versions like “SDBIL_CI_STANDARD_US” or “SDBIL_CI_STANDARD_DE”.&lt;BR /&gt;3. Select the standard template that best fits your region and select &lt;STRONG&gt;Copy&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;4. Give your new template a name. For example: `YY1_MYCORP_BILLING_FORM_US`.&lt;BR /&gt;5. Click &lt;STRONG&gt;OK&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2: Download the Layout and Make Basic Changes&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Now that you have your custom copy, let's download the layout file and add some fundamental customizations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1. On the &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Templates&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab, search for your new template.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Open the form template, then select &lt;STRONG&gt;Download&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Rajprit16_0-1764185718819.png" style="width: 665px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345555iB6A674FF264ACC0C/image-dimensions/665x241/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="665" height="241" role="button" title="Rajprit16_0-1764185718819.png" alt="Rajprit16_0-1764185718819.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3 Save and extract the zip archive. The archive contains the form template as an XDP file, data provider information in XSD format, and optionally, the form template master, also as an XDP file.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You are now in the design environment. On the left, you'll see the `Hierarchy` and `Data View` tabs. The `Data View` shows all the data fields available from the system, while the `Hierarchy` shows the structure of the form itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Common Requirement: Adding a Company Logo&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The recommended way to manage logos in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition with the &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Logos&lt;/STRONG&gt; app. You upload your logo there and it gets a unique name. The form can then pull it dynamically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Open the XDP file via Adobe LiveCycle Designer&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. In LiveCycle Designer, find the placeholder for the logo (it's often an Image Field object at the top).&lt;BR /&gt;3. Select the Image Field and go to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Object &lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;palette.&lt;BR /&gt;4. Ensure the &lt;STRONG&gt;Embed Image Data&lt;/STRONG&gt; option is &lt;STRONG&gt;unchecked&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;5. Go to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Binding&lt;/STRONG&gt; palette. You should see a binding reference like `$record.Form_Header.Logo.URL`. This tells the form to fetch the logo URL provided by the system. By using the &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Logos&lt;/STRONG&gt; app and this binding will work automatically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Rajprit16_1-1764185718823.png" style="width: 663px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345556iEF0544264A2A96CB/image-dimensions/663x394/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="663" height="394" role="button" title="Rajprit16_1-1764185718823.png" alt="Rajprit16_1-1764185718823.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Common Requirement: Adding Static Text (e.g., Terms &amp;amp; Conditions)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1. In the &lt;STRONG&gt;Hierarchy&lt;/STRONG&gt; view, find the content area where you want to add the text (e.g., `contentArea`).&lt;BR /&gt;2. Drag a &lt;STRONG&gt;Text&lt;/STRONG&gt; object from the &lt;STRONG&gt;Object Library&lt;/STRONG&gt; onto your form's design view.&lt;BR /&gt;3. Double-click the new text object and type or paste your terms and conditions.&lt;BR /&gt;4. In the &lt;STRONG&gt;Layout&lt;/STRONG&gt; palette, make sure the &lt;STRONG&gt;Expand to Fit&lt;/STRONG&gt; options are checked so the text block can grow as needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Rajprit16_2-1764185718829.png" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345557i4F511D16125F7B36/image-dimensions/669x397/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="669" height="397" role="button" title="Rajprit16_2-1764185718829.png" alt="Rajprit16_2-1764185718829.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3: Extending the Form with Custom Fields&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where the real power of extensibility shines. Let's say you need to add a "Project Manager" name to your billing documents, a field that doesn't exist in the standard system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Part A: Create the Custom Field in S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1. Open the &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Fields&lt;/STRONG&gt; app.&lt;BR /&gt;2. Click the &lt;STRONG&gt;+&lt;/STRONG&gt;icon to create a new field.&lt;BR /&gt;3. Select the Select the business context &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales: Billing Document&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This is crucial as it determines where the field can be used.&lt;BR /&gt;4. Provide a label for your field (e.g., “Project Manager”). Based on the label, the system suggests an identifier, for example, “YY1_ProjectManager&lt;BR /&gt;5. Choose a &lt;STRONG&gt;Type&lt;/STRONG&gt;, such as `Text`, and set the length.&lt;BR /&gt;6. Navigate to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Form Templates&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab. Find the data source and check the &lt;STRONG&gt;Enable Usage&lt;/STRONG&gt; box.&lt;BR /&gt;7&lt;STRONG&gt;. (Recommended) &lt;/STRONG&gt;Navigate to the &lt;STRONG&gt;User Interfaces &lt;/STRONG&gt;tab. Enable the field for `&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Billing Documents&lt;/STRONG&gt;` and `&lt;STRONG&gt;Create Billing Documents&lt;/STRONG&gt;` (business context - &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales: Billing Due List&lt;/STRONG&gt;) so you can see and edit it directly in the Fiori apps.&lt;BR /&gt;8. &lt;STRONG&gt;Save and Publish&lt;/STRONG&gt; your field. This process can take a few minutes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Rajprit16_3-1764185718830.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345558i3A71AE005EEB2214/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Rajprit16_3-1764185718830.png" alt="Rajprit16_3-1764185718830.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Part B: Update the Form Data Source and Layout&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1. Go back to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Maintain Form Templates&lt;/STRONG&gt; app.&lt;BR /&gt;2. Open your custom template (`YY1_MYCORP_BILLING_FORM_US`).&lt;BR /&gt;3. &lt;STRONG&gt;Download the form template again&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This is a critical step! Downloading the template again ensures the XDP 's schema is updated with the new custom field you just published.&lt;BR /&gt;4. Open the new XDP file in Adobe LiveCycle Designer.&lt;BR /&gt;5. Go to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Data View&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab. Expand the nodes to find your new field, YY1_ProjectManager.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;6.Drag your new field from the `Data View` and drop it onto the form canvas where you want it to appear. A caption and a text field will be created automatically.&lt;BR /&gt;7. Style and position the new field to match the rest of your form.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4: Upload and Activate Your Masterpiece&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Once you are happy with all your changes, it's time to upload the form back into the system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1. Save your XDP file in Adobe LiveCycle Designer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Return to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Maintain Form Templates&lt;/STRONG&gt; app in the SAP Fiori launchpad.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. On the Custom Templates tab, choose New.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. In the Create Form Template window, enter the form template name.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;5. To specify the location of the custom template XDP, choose Browse.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;6. From the Data Provider dropdown list, select FDP_V3_BD_STANDARD_SRV.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;7. To generate the custom template, choose OK.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;8. Finally, assign the form to a Business Context using configuration activity: &lt;STRONG&gt;Assign Form Templates&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Your form is now live and ready to be used.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5: Define When to Use Your New Form&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The last step is to tell the system the business rules for when to use your new form. This is done in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Output Parameter Determination&lt;/STRONG&gt; app.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1. Open the app and select &lt;STRONG&gt;Billing Document&lt;/STRONG&gt; from the &lt;STRONG&gt;Show Rules for&lt;/STRONG&gt; dropdown.&lt;BR /&gt;2. Select the &lt;STRONG&gt;Form Template&lt;/STRONG&gt; determination step.&lt;BR /&gt;3. In edit mode, create a new rule in the Decision Table. You can set conditions like: use `YY1_MYCORP_BILLING_FORM_US` &lt;STRONG&gt;IF&lt;/STRONG&gt; `Company Code` is `1010`, or &lt;STRONG&gt;IF&lt;/STRONG&gt; `Sales Organization` is `US01`.&lt;BR /&gt;4. Activate the new rule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Rajprit16_4-1764185718835.png" style="width: 703px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345559iE1419CA71C30432E/image-dimensions/703x362/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="703" height="362" role="button" title="Rajprit16_4-1764185718835.png" alt="Rajprit16_4-1764185718835.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Common Requirement: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;G&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;enerate multiple output items&lt;/STRONG&gt; – &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2757763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;KBA 2757763 - How to print to multiple print queues or generate multiple output items&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Now, when a billing document is created that matches your conditions, the system will automatically use your beautifully customized form template.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bonus tip on optimized handling of large data files :&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In certain business processes, the form data XML can get too large and form rendering is rejected from the Adobe Document Services.&lt;BR /&gt;In such cases, you can try the following options to reduce the size of the form data XML:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;• &lt;STRONG&gt;Use the 'Untag PDF'&amp;nbsp;option in the 'Assign Form Templates' configuration activity.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Depending on your configuration environment, you do configuration activities in either the Manage Your Solution app or in SAP Central Business Configuration. To access the documentation for configuration activities, open the Actions menu and select 'Configuration Help' (for Manage Your Solution) or choose 'Open Documentation' i&lt;SPAN&gt;n the documentation column (for Central Business Configuration).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;• &lt;STRONG&gt;Use the 'Optimize data service' option in the 'Maintain Form Templates' app.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By default, during form rendering all data fields contained in the form data provider are sent to the Adobe Document Services for rendering. When enabling the newly introduced flag: Optimize data service the underlying template source will be statically analyzed. Only data fields that are directly used in a data binding by form elements will be transferred. This reduces the data transfer volume and improve the rendering performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note that only data fields that are bound to an element in the form template will be detected and kept. Data fields that are only accessed via scripting are not supported. You can check existing data bindings by using the data view control in the Adobe LiveCycle Designer for SAP Solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP recommends testing the output by generating a preview when enabling this feature.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Further Reading&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For more in-depth information, please refer to these official resources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;* &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/Sol_Pack/Library/Setup/1LQ_Set-Up_EN_XX.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Setting Up Output Management - 1LQ Set Up Guide&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;* &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Community : &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-members/how-to-bring-custom-fields-to-billing-document-output-video-tutorial/ba-p/12857143" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to Bring Custom Fields to Billing Document Output (Video Tutorial)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;* &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a630d57fc5004c6383e7a81efee7a8bb/55476a4d700547239763321590483863.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Your SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition -&amp;gt; Document and Output Management&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;* &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/STRONG&gt; : &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/a376cd9ea00d476b96f18dea1247e6a5/d9cc17d1aa404aee9bf2d10599c9a8d1.html?version=2508.500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Output Management for Sales Documents and Billing Process Documents&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;* KBA &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2984817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2984817 - Form design in Adobe LiveCycle Designer&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I hope this guide empowers you to take control of your form templates.

    <content>Early Inspection Issue – Case 1 A production order is created for 10,000 PC, and an early inspection lot is automatically generated with a lot quantity of 10,000 PC. Results recording (RR) and usage decision (UD) are completed. After that, the production team posts a partial goods receipt of 1,000 PC. As a result, the system will show this 1,000 PC in the stock posting tab, and if you post this 1,000 PC to unrestricted, for example, the system puts this 1,000 PC as the actual lot qty and all stock posting fields are grayed out (disabled). From this point on, any additional goods receipts posted through MIGO are automatically posted directly to unrestricted stock, without appearing in QA32 under the inspection lot. As a result, QA32 does not display the subsequent received quantities, which appears to be a system defect.</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Case 2&lt;BR /&gt;If you create an early inspection lot for 10,000 PC, RR is done, and UD is not done yet. This partial qty of 6,000 PC is received in MIGO (GR from production order), then you move them to unrestricted stock from QA32. The system will take this 6,000 pc as the lot actual qty. Then, if you do any other GR for the rest of the order qty, for example the remaining 4,000 PC again, the system will create a new inspection lot with the remaining 4,000 PC which is strange behaviour. We are supposed to use this inspection lot to get only 1 inspection lot per order. So the solution is to prevent any stock posting done until someone makes sure there will not be any more GR on this production order. Do a user status without status number to be able to get it in the Selection Profile for the QA32 screen to use it for reporting.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

I am having issues with s/4hana cloud public practice test, exercise 9, data migration.

The file contains only one line" I am sure my file has 3 lines as instructed in the pdf file. I have deleted and redownloaded several times. I have been on this for over 3 days now.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We are continuously evolving the FinOps capabilities within the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) to empower you with the tools you need to manage your cloud spend effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Following the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/enhanced-finops-capabilities-for-sap-btp/ba-p/14113797" target="_blank"&gt;previous blog&lt;/A&gt;, &amp;nbsp;where we introduced beta functionalities for &lt;STRONG&gt;Budgets and Cloud Credits Forecast&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we are pleased to announce that both features are now &lt;STRONG&gt;productively available&lt;/STRONG&gt;. In addition, we are launching a &lt;STRONG&gt;brand-new Overview tab&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the &lt;EM&gt;Costs and Usage&lt;/EM&gt; page, serving as your central &lt;STRONG&gt;FinOps dashboard&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s take a closer look at what is new and what is coming next:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Productive Availability: Budgets and Cloud Credits Forecast&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are happy to announce that Budgets and Cloud Credits Forecast, previously available in beta, are now officially released for productive use.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With &lt;STRONG&gt;Budgets&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you can proactively monitor your spending by setting limits for your global account or specific organizational units and optionally choosing specific plans. Configurable alerts ensure you are notified before you exceed your amount limit, allowing for timely intervention. Complementing this is the &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Credits Forecast&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which uses historical data to predict future credit usage. This capability helps you anticipate cloud credits exceedance and making informed decisions to adjust credit purchases and reduce the risks of future costs. For more information, see &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/enhanced-finops-capabilities-for-sap-btp/ba-p/14113797" target="_blank"&gt;previous blog&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. The New 'Overview' Tab: Your FinOps Dashboard&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="2025-11-27_01-03-07.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345601i96D9EBED1FB04697/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2025-11-27_01-03-07.jpg" alt="2025-11-27_01-03-07.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The highlight of this announcement is the new&lt;STRONG&gt; Overview tab&lt;/STRONG&gt; within the &lt;EM&gt;Costs and Usage page&lt;/EM&gt; in the SAP BTP Cockpit. This tab serves as a central entry point for key insights and recommendations for &lt;STRONG&gt;BTP FinOps,&lt;/STRONG&gt; providing a clear, high-level view of your cloud spend at a glance. It is available for global accounts using consumption based commercial model or both consumption and subscription based commercial models.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the existing &lt;STRONG&gt;Billing&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Usage&lt;/STRONG&gt; tabs provide the granular details needed for deep-dive analysis, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab offers a quick status update and immediate answers to your BTP financial questions, without requiring you to navigate through complex data tables. &amp;nbsp;If you need additional information, you can easily explore further details by expanding specific cards or following the relevant links throughout the interface.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Key insights available on the Overview tab include:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monthly Costs Summary&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Provides quick summary of your costs over the last 12 months. This card provides a comparison against previous months, helping you spot trends or anomalies immediately.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consumption based commercial model&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Shows the status of your consumption-based model, including a monthly cost trend for your global account over the last 12 months&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Last Month's Prepaid Quota Consumption&lt;/STRONG&gt;: For global accounts using both consumption and subscription based commercial models, this card offers visibility into the utilization of your prepaid quota. It helps you understand service usage relative to your subscription-based plans so you can manage your quota more effectively. Usage within your prepaid quota is covered by your subscription-based commercial models, while any usage beyond it is billed under your consumption-based commercial models.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost Breakdown and Distribution&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Visualizes where your money is mostly spent by subaccount or service plan, making it easy to identify high-cost subaccounts (such as projects, teams or applications) or service plans over the last 12 months.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost-Related Recommendations&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Provides actionable insights and automated optimization suggestions based on your global account’s cost and usage patterns, helping you to proactively manage your cloud spend, prevent unexpected expenses, and optimize resource planning. Recommendations may include:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;U&gt;Budget Management&lt;/U&gt;: Suggestions to set up or renew budgets and alerts when budget amounts or thresholds are exceeded.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;U&gt;Cloud Credits Overage Forecasted: &lt;/U&gt;Informs if cloud credits are forecasted to be exceeded soon or alerts if current cloud credits have been exceeded, advising monitoring or purchasing additional cloud credits.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;U&gt;Cost Spikes&lt;/U&gt; – Identifies unusual increases in costs for subaccounts and the entire global account compared to historical patterns, encouraging review of detailed cost data to investigate the cause.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick links &lt;/STRONG&gt;(bottom card): Provides quick access to useful resources, such as billing information and details related to your consumption-based commercial model.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;You may notice that some of these cards were previously displayed in the &lt;EM&gt;Costs and Usage&lt;/EM&gt; page header and have now been moved to the Overview tab. As a result, the Billing, Usage, and Budgets tabs no longer include the page header, giving you more screen space and improved visibility for detailed information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/monitoring-usage-and-consumption-costs-in-your-global-account?version=Cloud#using-the-overview-tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;documentation.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Recent Innovations Already Available&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As you learn about new capabilities, we also want to ensure you’re aware of existing cost-management features, such as the SAP BTP price list links.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP BTP Cockpit now offers a direct link between your data in the &lt;EM&gt;Costs and Usage&lt;/EM&gt; page and the official SAP BTP price list, improving billing verification and cost transparency. You can easily access the correct BTP price list that matches your contract type, date, and currency, and directly link each billable item in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Costs and Usage - Billing view&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;to its corresponding price list entry. This enhancement removes manual cross-checking and simplifies accurate cost validation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/monitoring-usage-and-consumption-costs-in-your-global-account#using-the-billing-tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;documentation.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. What&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ʼ&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;s Next in 2026?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our journey doesn't stop here. We have an exciting roadmap ahead to further enhance your FinOps experience on SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73555000100800000287&amp;amp;range=CURRENT-LAST#;INNO=000D3AAADBCE1FE0AD9C07DBF8347563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Chatbot for BTP FinOps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;: Soon, we plan to offer you the ability to simply ask questions about your BTP costs, trends and summaries to get instant answers via our AI copilot, Joule.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73555000100800000287&amp;amp;range=CURRENT-LAST#;INNO=000D3AAADBCE1FE0AD9C0A409FA73563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Intuitive Access to the Audit Log&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;: We will streamlining traceability with direct, setup-free access to the Audit Log Viewer from the BTP cockpit.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced Cross-Charge and Cost Allocation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: We plan to enable advanced features to offer granular visibility below the subaccount level and the ability to allocate costs using FinOps tags across the account hierarchy, for example for business units, cost centers and projects.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost visibility &amp;amp; delegation&lt;/STRONG&gt;​: We would like to allow subaccount administrators to gain deeper cost visibility, empowering them to monitor and manage their spending more effectively.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;All these innovations are planned to be integrated directly into the SAP BTP cockpit, delivering a unified, seamless experience for your BTP FinOps activities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;* This is the current state of planning and may be changed by SAP at any time.​&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Stay tuned for more details via blogs and roadmap explorer.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Looks very nice. But you say it's productive but we don't see it yet?&amp;nbsp;Also, the "Show Forecast" toggle does not work in FireFox.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;PS The screenshot is a bit small and not able to properly be viewed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use Datastore to avoid too many duplicate MPL attachments in exception retries&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog post demonstrates how to use DataStore to retain Source payload &amp;amp; Intermediate Payload for error handling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Common Practice is to write the Source Payload and intermediate payload (inflight payload) into MPL attachment using groovy script.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Problem:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In general, for Asynchronous scenario retry mechanism is placed to resend the failed message until the issue is fixed. Sometimes we want flexibility on retry mechanism without placing restriction on fixed number of retries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This flexibility helps Interface to automatically resend the failed messages when target connection is resolved without manual intervention or when we are waiting for a change to move to production then it should automatically process the failed message.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This flexibility comes at a cost of writing the payload into MPL attachment every time message goes into error/exception. This fills up limited Monitoring Storage. If your interface is retried 100 times at least 100/200 MPL attachments will be created in Message Monitoring. This Problem is exaggerated if we have high volume interface.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We generally use exception subprocess to log source payload as an attachment using groovy script which is helpful during error for debugging later.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Groovy Script.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;/* Refer the link below to learn more about the use cases of script.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/148851bf8192412cba1f9d2c17f4bd25.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/viewer/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/Cloud/en-US/148851bf8192412cba1f9d2c17f4bd25.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you want to know more about the SCRIPT APIs, refer the link below&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/doc/a56f52e1a58e4e2bac7f7adbf45b2e26/Cloud/en-US/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/doc/a56f52e1a58e4e2bac7f7adbf45b2e26/Cloud/en-US/index.html&lt;/A&gt;

Alternative MPL ID ca also be used for cleanup.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alternatively, APIs can also be used to automate to clean up data store entries on a scheduled basis.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dear SAP Community,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are seeking guidance on the best practice for implementing a custom action triggered during the Sales Order creation process in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1894774205"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Core Requirement&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;We need to implement a &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;Before Save&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; action (similar to a &lt;I&gt;Pre-Exit&lt;/I&gt; logic) during the creation of a &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order (SO)&lt;/STRONG&gt; by the Key User. The goal is that, once the Sales Order is successfully created in the system, the external SOAP API: &lt;CODE&gt;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/SERVICECONTRACTREQUEST_IN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://api.sap.com/api/SERVICECONTRACTREQUEST_IN&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt; must be consumed and executed immediately.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1698260700"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Specific Technical Questions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1630829914"&gt;1. Internal API Consumption via ABAP Environment (ADT)&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Internal Consumption via ADT:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Is it possible to consume this specific SOAP API directly within the &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Environment (ADT)&lt;/STRONG&gt; using &lt;STRONG&gt;Developer Extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt; options (e.g., via &lt;STRONG&gt;EML (Entity Manipulation Language)&lt;/STRONG&gt; or an internal release)? Or is this API strictly intended for &lt;STRONG&gt;external consumption&lt;/STRONG&gt; (side-by-side extensibility via RAP, Java, or JavaScript)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;If internal consumption is possible, what is the &lt;STRONG&gt;recommended BAdI (Business Add-In)&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the Sales Order flow that executes &lt;STRONG&gt;after all consistency checks&lt;/STRONG&gt; but &lt;STRONG&gt;before the final commit&lt;/STRONG&gt; to ensure API execution aligns with the SO creation?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1434316409"&gt;2. Locking Behavior &amp;amp; Concurrency&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Locking Behavior:&lt;/STRONG&gt; If a Key User currently has the specific Sales Order open and is actively using it within the UI, will the API request fail due to a &lt;STRONG&gt;locking conflict&lt;/STRONG&gt; if the API attempts to create a follow-up document?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;In systems like SAP Business ByDesign, concurrent editing is strictly disallowed. We would like to confirm if S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition behaves similarly, and what implications this has for external API calls triggered by the Key User's save action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Thank you for your insights and recommendations.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
