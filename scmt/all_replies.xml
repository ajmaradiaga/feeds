Del Rosario, Head of AI Security for SAP ISBN, and Jay Thoden van Velzen, Technical Advisor, Office of the CSO&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This blog is the second part in a series on agentic AI security. The first can be found &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/security-and-compliance-blogs/that-s-not-what-we-agreed-repudiation-and-agentic-ai-threat-modeling/ba-p/14208975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;here&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the previous blog in this series, we covered the non-deterministic nature of agentic AI systems and the repudiation threats involved with that. To help reduce the attack surface and provide greater resilience to these and other STRIDE threats, few strategies are better than limiting what an agent is allowed to do. We must restrict access to tools and systems to agents and authorize them only to what they need to complete their tasks. Just as we do with human users or non-human service accounts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1631872993"&gt;Agent IAM and the Principle of Least Privilege&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) are established pillars of cybersecurity. IAM governs access to tools and applications based on your role and function in an organization. Regular users have different access privileges than administrators. The general accepted advice in security and compliance is to apply the &lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;principle of least privilege&lt;/A&gt;. That is, only apply those authorizations that are necessary for users to accomplish their tasks and perform their functions, but not more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The same principle applies to system accounts. Application and system users similarly need to be restricted. In large monolithic applications this can be difficult to achieve when the system must perform many privileged talks. Microservices architecture offers the advantage of applying more granular authorizations to individual system components. We allow one component to have database access to record transactions but restrict it from exposure to the public internet. Meanwhile, another&amp;nbsp;receives API requests from the internet but doesn’t need a database connection. Yet another microservice can function as a request dispatcher, limited to communication to other system components.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Human users notoriously find ways to accomplish their tasks in creative ways. System accounts stick to their assigned function even when overprivileged, and the key risk is that such accounts are compromised and abused by malicious human actors. AI agents unpredictably misbehave. By decomposing system functionality into more granular agents with narrow focus and scope, we gain more control points to reduce misaligned behavior.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1435359488"&gt;Tool and System Access&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first layer of tool and system access for agents is with a system account. This works best where the access to the service has no distinction in authorizations between different users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consider an agentic AI system that analyzes sales reports for a retail chain and annotates anomalous weekly movement up or down with external events. Such events could be local news, sports or cultural events, regional holidays and weather reports with an impact on overall sales or sales categories. Unexpected, pleasant warm weather can explain an increase in sales in sunglasses, bathing suits and ice cream, while pending snowstorms clarify unexpected sales increases in canned and frozen goods. A county fair or key home team match can be the reason weekend shopping is down. The system uses a central orchestration agent, supported by specific agents to collect news, local event calendars and weather information from 3rd-party services. Each of these services provides full access to their database for search over the entire dataset for subscribed customers with an API key.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this case, it is trivial to restrict the weather agent – and only the weather agent – to only be allowed to search historical weather reports. The orchestrator agent must only provide a date or date range of any anomalous results for a particular location to the weather agent to operate. It has no need or purpose for the sales data. Similarly, an agent looking for local news events that could impact sales only needs a date range for a summary of local news.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We need to limit the weather agent identity to only&amp;nbsp;perform the task it’s intended to do. If the weather agent can only ever contact the weather service and no other resource on the internet, even when the agent displays non-deterministic behavior it produces nothing more than a weather report. Suppose that somehow an instruction asks the agent to look up other resources, it would only be able to reply with weather information. It can’t send e-mails if the agent has no access to a mail server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the examples above, limits are applied by authorizations applied to the agent’s role. However, that assumes that we trust the agent. That is not necessarily guaranteed, especially in a multi-party agentic AI system – for instance where the weather agent is a third party service or has been compromised. An orchestrator agent that delegates tasks to other agents can limit the weather agent’s capabilities on the task level, overriding any overprivileged role-based authorizations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Limiting an agent to only the role and tasks it is supposed to do greatly reduces the risks of misalignment to its goals. For such cases where there are no different access levels for the user of the system, such controls work well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1238845983"&gt;Act in the Context of the User&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, we should consider the sales report – that data needs to come from somewhere as well, typically a business application with more refined access rights and restrictions. Our example agentic AI system with a business data agent collecting and analyzing the sales results needs to consider that not all the systems users likely have access to the same level of information. A regional manager may only be able to see results from a particular region, a store manager only for their own store. System access doesn’t restrict the agent enough, as the agent could be persuaded to share information from other regions. Agents with access to business systems need to act as a delegate and adopts the user's access and authorizations for any particular request.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An agentic AI system allowed to make transactions in business systems should only allow&amp;nbsp;users to perform tasks they are authorized to do otherwise in the business application. Users using an agentic AI system to book travel must only be able to book their own along the same privileges if they logged on to SAP Concur. Agents should only have access to HR and payroll information the user has in SAP SuccessFactors. Users using an agentic AI purchasing system must be prevented from&amp;nbsp;ordering expensive laptops for an entire team if they aren't authorized to do so in SAP Ariba. For access to critical systems with established access right dependent on one’s role and function in an organization agents must act within the context of the user. Such agents must essentially assume its role and identity in the system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similarly, if you’re building your own agentic AI system, ensure that you apply this same principle of user context for appropriate access to restricted databases, business applications and cloud services. A system account alone with broad access isn’t sufficient to prevent unauthorized disclosure of restricted information. It will be impossible to reliably replicate and control the users’ roles and authorization in the source systems. Meanwhile, the business systems already have all the authorizations the user needs, hopefully under the same least privilege principle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1042332478"&gt;Segregation of Duties&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The separation can be further narrowed down. An agent that reads a sales catalogue and selects options for a user to pick from doesn’t need to be the same agent that ultimately executes the purchase order. An agent that is only allowed to search through the catalogue can never accidentally order something. A purchasing agent, on the other hand is far more likely to behave when it is given a clear instruction to purchase a specific list of items but can’t search the catalogue to inadvertently add other items.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Separation of duties between different agents with different functions - reading from access-controlled business systems compared to processing or initiating transactions – in the design of the agentic AI system makes it more resilient to model misbehavior. When we restrict the authorization for the agent to only search the catalogue, it can never make purchases before the human buyer approves it. Similarly, restricting the purchasing agent from searching the catalog prevents it from adding any items the human buyer didn’t select.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-845818973"&gt;Agents as Potential Threat Actors&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;As we saw in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/security-and-compliance-blogs/that-s-not-what-we-agreed-repudiation-and-agentic-ai-threat-modeling/ba-p/14208975" target="_blank"&gt;part one&lt;/A&gt;, when threat modeling agentic AI system, we can’t only account for malicious users in the tradition cybersecurity sense. Regular users can trigger misaligned behavior. But agents themselves have agency – that is, they have autonomy to act, even when limited. They are actors in the system, even if not &lt;EM&gt;conscious&lt;/EM&gt; actors. Therefore, it is important that designers and developers of agentic AI systems consider that during threat modeling and build in the appropriate protections.&amp;nbsp;Secure Agentic design introduces the concept of “Architectural Constraints,” as discussed in this article, which are powerful concepts that help eliminate an entire class of threats against agents and language model misbehavior. These hard controls are essential in designing secure agents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In part three, we will discuss an architecture pattern that provides such constraints.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-649305468"&gt;More Information&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Principle of Least Privilege&lt;/A&gt; (Wikipedia)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/security-and-compliance-blogs/that-s-not-what-we-agreed-repudiation-and-agentic-ai-threat-modeling/ba-p/14208975" target="_blank"&gt;“That’s Not What We Agreed!” – Repudiation and Agentic AI Threat Modeling&lt;/A&gt; (SAP Community)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;OWASP Agentic AI – Threats and Mitigations&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for the document on Refurbishment processes—both internal and external. It was very insightful and has greatly helped me in learning, configuring, and testing the process in our system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That said, I noticed that for &lt;STRONG&gt;external refurbishment&lt;/STRONG&gt;, most maintenance orders are not initiated through &lt;STRONG&gt;IW81 (PM04)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. I would appreciate your guidance on the following points:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is it feasible to process external refurbishment via &lt;STRONG&gt;IW81 (PM04)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and still generate the subcontracting PR &amp;amp; PO?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When receiving the refurbished item from the vendor, should the refurbished stock be updated immediately in the system?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Could you kindly share the complete and clear external refurbishment process using &lt;STRONG&gt;IW81 (PM04)&lt;/STRONG&gt; with subcontracting PR, along with the related &lt;STRONG&gt;financial implications&lt;/STRONG&gt;?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1761786819"&gt;SAP Today: A Technical Perspective&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When we talk about SAP today, it’s no longer just about ERP. The platform now integrates with AI, machine learning, and cloud technologies. For example, SAP &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt; supports real-time analytics. Instead of waiting hours for batch reports, finance and operations teams can work with live data and speed up decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Integration is another key area. Many organizations run multiple systems: CRM, HR, supply chain, and more. SAP &lt;STRONG&gt;BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Business Technology Platform) provides a framework that lets these systems communicate. That reduces data duplication, cuts manual steps, and gives more reliable outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is also a notable shift toward sustainability and compliance. SAP includes capabilities to track carbon footprints, manage ESG data, and meet global reporting standards. This is now a requirement in many industries, and the platform provides tools to handle the related complexity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From a technical view, the migration path is important. Moving from ECC to &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt; is not just a technical upgrade it requires rethinking processes. Many organizations use the migration to automate workflows, add predictive analytics, or connect IoT devices to ERP. It is as much transformation as it is technology.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In short, SAP is evolving beyond an ERP backbone into a digital core covering analytics, integration, compliance, and automation. The convergence of SAP with AI and cloud-native apps will continue to deepen this role.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In one of my previous projects we also had to make a similiar decision. There were already several checks and validations build (duplicate checks/address validation etc.) in S/4 in the customer create proces but with the introdution of C4C v1 there was a need to support the proces from this system as well. In the end we decided to create a custom SAP UI5 app on S/4HANA and embed this in C4C with a mash-up (new custom workcenter). In this way we could leverage the already existing S/4 functionality in customer create proces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;KR,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Simon&lt;/P&gt;</content>

In this session, we'll guide you through the process of evaluating your current application landscape, share best practices for assessment, and provide actionable strategies you can implement in your organization.&lt;/P&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4778"&gt;@Brian&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For month-over-month calculations in MDX, you can use&amp;nbsp;PrevMember instead of [Prior], like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[NetAR].CurrentMember - [NetAR].CurrentMember.PrevMember&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This gives the difference between the current and previous month. For more complex calculations across multiple accounts, using Account Transformation logic can help automate and simplify the process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;John&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>From REST to Datasphere: A CAP-based Integration Approach</title>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1631072292"&gt;From REST to Datasphere: A CAP-based Integration Approach&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We recently wrote a blog about how we integrate data from a REST service into SAP Datasphere. For that we deployed a small service on SAP BTP, which used the OPEN SQL schema and FastAPI to write this data directly into Datasphere. That service could also be triggered via REST endpoint from SAP Datasphere directly (&lt;A href="https://www.zpartner.eu/streamlining-rest-api-integrations-in-sap-datasphere-with-task-chains-and-fastapi-microservices-on-sap-btp/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;ZPARTNER Link&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/streamlining-rest-api-integrations-in-sap-datasphere-with-task-chains-and/ba-p/14169273" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Community Link)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog we now choose a different setup to retrieve data and consume it into SAP Dataphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We Created a CAP Application on SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This CAP service connects to the SCIM API of SAP Datasphere, extracts users and roles, and makes the data consumable for analytics. It uses the following BTP services:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HDI Container&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To persist our data from the REST calls. The HDI container is deployed to the HANA Cloud instance of our Datasphere tenant, so the data can be consumed directly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BTP Credential Store&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;We store the credentials for the SCIM API in the BTP Credential Store and retrieve them in our CAP application securely.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;XSUAA Authorization and Trust Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To secure our REST endpoints and enforce token-based access control.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Foundry Space&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Provides the runtime environment for deploying the CAP application.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="christian_willi_0-1758034031474.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315296i7682A0680123DAA5/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="christian_willi_0-1758034031474.png" alt="christian_willi_0-1758034031474.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1434558787"&gt;Use Case&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our use case, we extract user information from SAP Datasphere’s own SCIM API.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We retrieve:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the list of users,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;all available roles, and&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the assignments between users and roles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This can be helpful for reporting on the number of users in a tenant and their corresponding roles. However, the same setup can be reused to extract and process any other REST API data into SAP Datasphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1238045282"&gt;Credential Store&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We create a dedicated namespace in the Credential Store and store four secrets for the SCIM API authentication flow:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;dsp-scim-token-url&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;dsp-scim-base-url&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;dsp-scim-client-id&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;dsp-scim-client-secret&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The CAP application retrieves these secrets at runtime, ensuring no credentials are hardcoded.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1041531777"&gt;XSUAA Authorization and Trust Management Service&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We create a dedicated xsuaa service to get a Token URL and credentials. This service is bound to our CAP application so that every incoming request is authorized and protected.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-845018272"&gt;HDI Container&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We create an HDI container where the database artifacts (tables and associations) are deployed. This container is provisioned in our SAP Datasphere tenant, making the synchronized data directly available for consumption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-648504767"&gt;CAP Application&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The heart of the solution is the CAP service DSPUsers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It exposes two kinds of endpoints:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-581073981"&gt;Virtual Views (live from SCIM)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GET /data/UsersVH → List of users with profile info.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GET /data/RolesVH → Roles with aggregated user counts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GET /data/UserRolesVH → Which users have which roles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These views are always fresh, since they query SCIM directly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-384560476"&gt;Persistent Entities (stored in HDI)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GET /data/Users → Users persisted in HANA.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GET /data/Roles → Roles persisted in HANA.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GET /data/UserRoles → User-to-role assignments persisted in HANA.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-188046971"&gt;Actions (to sync SCIM → HDI)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;POST /data/SyncUsersVHToUsers → Upserts SCIM users into the Users table.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;POST /data/SyncRolesFromSCIM → Stores aggregated roles in the Roles table.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;POST /data/SyncUserRolesFromSCIM → Refreshes both Roles and UserRoles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This design lets you both query SCIM data live and persist snapshots into HANA for modeling in Datasphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The complete CAP service code is available here: &lt;A href="https://github.com/zpartner/cap-scim-handler-dsp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Link to GitHub Repository&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--137549253"&gt;SAP Datasphere&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once deployed, the HDI container is automatically integrated with our SAP Datasphere tenant. This allows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Consuming the Users, Roles, and UserRoles tables directly in Datasphere,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Building reporting scenarios on top of user and role data,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joining with other business data to enrich analytics.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To consume the entities, we need to add the HDI Container to a specific space. Also, we can now create a generic HTTP Connection. This enables to call the Endpoints for sync in a Task Chain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="christian_willi_1-1758034059841.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315297i9C02A86C7A1B379C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="christian_willi_1-1758034059841.png" alt="christian_willi_1-1758034059841.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-435677325"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The integration of a CAP-based service into SAP Datasphere showcases how SAP BTP services (HDI Container, Credential Store, XSUAA, Cloud Foundry) can be combined to securely retrieve and persist data from external REST APIs. By consuming SAP Datasphere’s own SCIM API, we demonstrated how to expose both live views for real-time insights and persistent tables for analytical modeling, all within a lightweight and extensible architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking ahead, this framework can be reused for any REST API integration into SAP Datasphere, opening the door to richer reporting scenarios, advanced data modeling, and seamless orchestration with Task Chains. With this foundation, organizations gain a simple but powerful pattern for bridging external services with Datasphere while maintaining enterprise-grade security and governance.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Experts,&lt;BR /&gt;We are trying to set up non-user interactive OAuth2.0 Authentication for S4HC APIs, to access the APIs from third party applications&lt;BR /&gt;Can this be achieved without BTP?&lt;BR /&gt;Also are the Standard APIs restricted to use only OAuth2.0 Access code flow? or can other grant types be used?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="JessieJohnson_0-1759211703812.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321454iC1910A0D93274DE3/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="JessieJohnson_0-1759211703812.png" alt="JessieJohnson_0-1759211703812.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Cause when I try to set up inbound OAuth2.0 Clients in my customizing tenant, the grant type is disabled and only shows Authorization code + PKCE&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="JessieJohnson_1-1759212098346.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321461i50D5046E08556146/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="JessieJohnson_1-1759212098346.png" alt="JessieJohnson_1-1759212098346.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;And if i were to add my OAuth2.0 Provider, the autogenerated inbound Oauth2.0 clients have the grant type SAML2 Bearer Assertion. Are these the only two grant types that can be configured in the Tenant?&lt;BR /&gt;If BTP is my only option, could you please direct me to blogs with steps to set up Oauth2.0 client credentials in cockpit (Cloud foundry) and s4hana cloud instance and finally test from postman?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/55"&gt;@Andre_Fischer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/145194"&gt;@Sandra_Rossi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/40654"&gt;@Amin_Omidy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/743"&gt;@quovadis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Expert, I got a requirement, that is if the receiver machine cost center have actual activity type qty (have output) , then the sender cost center need to allocate to these receiver cost centers equally.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ie.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sender cost center&amp;nbsp; $100&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Receiver cost center A , actual activity type 5 Hours&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Receiver cost center B, actual activity type 15 Hours&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After Template Allocation run:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Receiver cost center A&amp;nbsp; 100/2=50&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Receiver cost center B 100/2=50&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How can I realize this requirement? Which Function should I use in CPT3 and how to write the formula?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The reason the costing view is created in the selection step is that the costing run is a &lt;I&gt;preparatory&lt;/I&gt; step. Even if a material is V-priced, it might be a &lt;STRONG&gt;component&lt;/STRONG&gt; in a higher-level product's Bill of Material (BOM). To perform the cost roll-up for the final product, the system needs a valid cost estimate (a cost component split) for &lt;STRONG&gt;every component&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which is why it selects them and creates the view even if it's only to calculate a "statistical" standard cost that won't be used for inventory valuation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1761786949"&gt;Primary Solution: Excluding Materials from Selection (best practice)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is &lt;STRONG&gt;no standard checkbox&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the CK40N selection screen to exclude materials based on their &lt;STRONG&gt;Price Control (V)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The field is not available in the standard dynamic selections.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The most effective ways to exclude materials are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1694356163"&gt;A. Exclude by Procurement Type (Best Standard Option)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;For materials intended to be on price control V (like &lt;STRONG&gt;Raw Materials&lt;/STRONG&gt;), they should typically have a &lt;STRONG&gt;Procurement Type (MARC-BESKZ)&lt;/STRONG&gt; of &lt;STRONG&gt;F (External Procurement)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1497842658"&gt;B. Exclude by Material Type or Material Number Range&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;If your Price V materials belong to specific Material Types (e.g., &lt;STRONG&gt;ROH&lt;/STRONG&gt; for Raw Materials, &lt;STRONG&gt;VERP&lt;/STRONG&gt; for Packaging), you can exclude these types directly in the initial CK40N selection screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1172246434"&gt;Second solution: Preventing View Creation or Costing (Alternative Method)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1104815648"&gt;Use the "Do Not Cost" Indicator&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the most direct control in the material master:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Costing 1&lt;/STRONG&gt; view of the Price V material master (&lt;CODE&gt;MM02&lt;/CODE&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Set the &lt;STRONG&gt;Do Not Cost&lt;/STRONG&gt; indicator (&lt;CODE&gt;CKMLHD-XKALK&lt;/CODE&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Materials with this indicator checked will be explicitly &lt;STRONG&gt;excluded from selection and BOM explosion&lt;/STRONG&gt; in a costing run. This is a clean, master data-driven way to prevent costing for a material.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear SAP Exports,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am creating a KPI report based on CDS views and analytical reports. I have tried three options — Generic Drilldown, Analytical List Page, and Data Analyzer&amp;nbsp;and I also created stories. However, the report is not displaying correctly across the three display types and would like to know which option is best for visualizing the entire report in graphical form and for presenting data in KPI cards.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Could you please provide step-by-step instructions for creating a KPI report with graphical visualizations and KPI cards?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you and kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, it is possible through business rules.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Create custom date field for approval date (hide it on screen).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Write business rule based on requisition status change (approved status automatically required to set so that we can consider the approval date is status change date from preapproved to approved)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;for further information/support reach me on &lt;A href="mailto:RCMRMK2@GMAIL.COM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;RCMRMK2@GMAIL.COM&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;on MS teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Amaranatha G&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;hello chris, We are in the same situation. We have been able to replicate the users, but with the groups the exact same thing happens. We created the groups in IAS with the prefix CIM_ and assigned the users to these groups. After reading your response, we tried to access the application "Configure Assignment Group Rules", but when we open it, we get the following error message: "Unable to load Cloud Studio, DEP_1031 Environment does not exists"&amp;nbsp; We don’t understand why it says that the environment does not exists (we ran the booster). Do you know what might be happening with this application?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This blog shows you how to integrate Microsoft Copilot and Teams with Joule so that your users can have conversational interactions that include content about integrated Microsoft applications. With the previous blog, we established the technical infrastructure so that Microsoft and SAP systems trust each other and exchange any required tokens for the two systems to interact. In the next steps, we add the required API permissions for Microsoft Graph&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The following figure shows our target architecture.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MichaelShea_1-1756385632038.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305930iC0B318F68B9C00C3/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MichaelShea_1-1756385632038.png" alt="MichaelShea_1-1756385632038.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1730624478" id="toc-hId-1738817933"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You've configured your tenants SAP Cloud Identity Services and Microsoft Entra ID to trust each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;You need the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TenantId&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;which you noted down during the registration of your federation app in Microsoft Entra ID.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You've set up conditional authentication for Joule.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For details, see our previous blog&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A title="Configuring SAP Cloud Identity Services and Microsoft Entra ID for Joule" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/configuring-sap-cloud-identity-services-and-microsoft-entra-id-for-joule/ba-p/14105743" target="_blank"&gt;Configuring SAP Cloud Identity Services and Microsoft Entra ID for Joule&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1534110973" id="toc-hId-1542304428"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configure Your Microsoft Entra ID Tenant&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Go to the Entra ID Admin Center with the admin user role.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1270166682" id="toc-hId-1474873642"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configure API Permissions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Go to&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Home &amp;gt; Identity &amp;gt; Applications &amp;gt; App registrations&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose your federation app.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;API permissions&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Add a permission&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose &lt;STRONG&gt;Microsoft Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add the following permissions:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sites.Read.All&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mail.Read&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;People.Read.All&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Chat.Read&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ChannelMessage.Read.All&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ExternalItem.Read.All&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MichaelShea_2-1756304656530.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305589i18556225E675F065/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MichaelShea_2-1756304656530.png" alt="MichaelShea_2-1756304656530.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Choose&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Add Permissions&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Choose&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Grant Admin Consent&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;{Entra_ID_Tenant_Name}&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and choose&lt;STRONG&gt;Yes&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MichaelShea_1-1756304618590.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305588i7DD0B8EDE79099F8/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MichaelShea_1-1756304618590.png" alt="MichaelShea_1-1756304618590.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-551543448" id="toc-hId-1149277418"&gt;Give it a Go&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;If everything is configured correctly, you can open your Joule client and ask, "What is in my calendar today?"

    <title>Fixing the “More Members Available” Issue in SAP Analysis for Office based on Custom CDS Views</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;While working with SAP S/4HANA Embedded Analytics and SAP Analysis for Office (AFO), you may encounter the message: "More Members Available"&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;This typically appears when filtering or selecting values in prompts, and it indicates that the number of available members exceeds the display threshold. Although SAP provides a configuration setting (FetchMemberLimit) to increase the limit, this doesn’t always resolve the issue, especially when the value help includes duplicate entries.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Standard Fix: You can try increasing the member limit in AFO:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Go to File &amp;gt; Analysis &amp;gt; Customize Analysis &amp;gt; Technical Configuration&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Set FetchMemberLimit to a value higher than the expected number of members.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;However, this only works if the number of members is within the new threshold. If duplicate entries exist, the system still struggles to display all entries. In many cases, the issue arises from repeated members in the value help CDS view. This is common when the value help is generated from a custom CDS view without ensuring uniqueness.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;To resolve this, modify your value help CDS view to return distinct values.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Syntax&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;define view XXXXX as select distinct from XXXX&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;{&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;}&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In previous blogs, we have seen how value help can be generated with help of below annotations.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;@Consumption.filter.multipleSelections: true&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;@Consumption.valueHelp:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The “More Members Available” issue in SAP Analysis for Office can be frustrating, but it’s often solvable with a simple tweak to your CDS view design. By ensuring your value help view returns distinct values, you can improve usability and performance in your embedded analytics reports.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;we're running S/4 HANA 2023 FP1 on-premise and as part of our clean core strategy, we need to deal with forms as well. As today, we use all available technologies like SAPScript, SmartForms as well as Adobe Forms. For sure, we only stick to Adobe Forms for new forms since several years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To my understanding, we can use SAP Forms in BTP also on-premise. It will only be a replacement for our on-prem ADS, but there is no need to change any print report or form. So we can still use all the NAST and other stuff available since decades. This only covers infrastructure in my opinion. But what is the difference from a developers perspective?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As we all know, reports are not clean core compliant. This must also be true to print reports you define in customizing. So there will be no print report in future anymore. We actually have no plans to move to cloud but at least I want to be prepared for this. This brings me to my final question&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What do we need to consider when it comes to developing SAP Forms in a cloud-ready manner? Where and how should we place our custom logic for custom forms as well as for SAP standard forms (i.e. handling templates for invoices, purchase orders etc.)? How to do this to be able to use the form in both, on-premise as well as cloud?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- do we need to replace the logic from Z-print reports to Z-classes? (we typically do this these days)&lt;BR /&gt;- do we need to place custom logic into interface of a form (we do this for standard forms [invoices] to be able to stick to standard print reports)&lt;BR /&gt;- anything else we should consider on-premise?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As said, actually there are no plans to move but at least we should be prepared for this. At least we need to refine our development guidelines to reflect any new concept.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our current approach looks like this:&lt;BR /&gt;- in case of totally custom form, any code is handled by dedicated print classes. The classes implement the business logic as well as calling the form FMs&lt;BR /&gt;- in case of adopting standard forms, we copy standard form interfaces and add any additional custom code inside this. Same is true for form itself for sure. By this, we can still use standard print reports&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;- in any case, we try to avoid mixing both concepts. Code should be either in dedicated print class or in interface but not in both.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope someone can give me some hints&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Patrick&lt;/P&gt;</content>

My understanding is as follows, just for your information:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- LEAVE_UNCHANGED_UNTOUCHED: The tables and partitions that are already correctly placed according to the table placement rules are left unchanged.&lt;BR /&gt;- KEEP_VALID: I don't know the difference from LEAVE_UNCHANGED_UNTOUCHED.&lt;BR /&gt;- NO_SPLIT: Don't perform splitting of tables or partitions during the reorganization process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I think in most cases, LEAVE_UNCHANGED_UNTOUCHED should be good.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regarding the command:&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;gt; CALL REORG_GENERATE(14, 'LEAVE_UNCHANGED_UNTOUCHED');&lt;BR /&gt;It should be correct, as I was able to execute it successfully in my local system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;And where would I find the results of the checks?&lt;BR /&gt;You can find the details via the following SQL:&lt;BR /&gt;SELECT * FROM REORG_PLAN_INFOS;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Charles&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Is this correct?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Konrad&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;With the latest release for SAP Central Business Configuration, an exciting new feature is available. This blog post will provide you with a concise overview.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced Transparency for Initial Scoping&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’re excited to announce that you can now quickly identify scenarios that are only selectable during initial scoping, all without leaving SAP Central Business Configuration. In the &lt;EM&gt;Define Scope&lt;/EM&gt; app, the new &lt;EM&gt;Selection Allowed&lt;/EM&gt; filter lets you display scenarios that can only be added initially, not later. This provides clarity on the scope decisions you need to make before confirming your scope for the first time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Selection Allowed filter in the Define Scope app" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321484i9C66A7299FB8FF7F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2_Selection Allowed_Dropdown without Navigation.png" alt="Selection Allowed filter in the Define Scope app" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Selection Allowed filter in the Define Scope app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;For a quick summary, check out this tutorial about &lt;A title="What's New in 2506 FD2" href="https://education.enable-now.cloud.sap/pub/cbc/index.html?show=project!PR_C9A51C8DADD995BB:uebung" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;What's New in 2506 FD2&lt;/A&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1794365"&gt;@archana_raut38&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for your question.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As you mentioned, what you observed is a standard system behaviour in public cloud. Depreciation keys like LINS do not allow switching to manual mode for unplanned postings. Once you post unplanned depreciation with a manual key, you cannot revert back without inconsistencies.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Therefore, posting extraordinary depreciations using the standard transactions type (e.g., 640) while keeping the asset assigned to the planned depreciation key remains the supported approach. After this posting, the system reduces the net book value and automatically recalculated planned depreciation across the remaining useful life. In doing so, the system ensures that:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extraordinary depreciation is recognised immediately.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Planned depreciation continues automatically and distributed across the updated net book value and useful life.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The conclusion is you do not need to change depreciation keys. You only need to use the correct transaction type for unplanned depreciation within the standard depreciation framework.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Have a look at &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BW_4HANA_BUSINESS_CONSOLIDATION_ADDON/d061beefd15b4b00b2e3e54b6687c2ba/cbebb0a3be674951ab492143119fcc1e.html?locale=en-US#use" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Extraordinary Depreciation&lt;/A&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/33b132c0121c41f3b412258173d76b0d/bdce759627a64e9f8f6ab3a6ca6cc45b.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Depreciation Keys&lt;/A&gt; for more details.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Best regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Chris&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The recommended approach in Public Cloud is to use OData or SOAP APIs for Product Master (Material Master) creation and updates. You can build a lightweight interface that only passes the 4–5 fields your customer cares about, while default values for mandatory fields are handled in:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Business Configuration (SSCUI settings)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Defaulting logic in APIs&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Custom Business Add‑Ins (BAdIs) in the Cloud (limited but available).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Example: API_PRODUCT_SRV (OData) or Product Master – Create/Update SOAP API.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi SAP,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are planning the migration of our on-premise Solution Manager system (dual-stack: ABAP + JAVA) to Microsoft Azure, and would like your input on the best migration approach considering the following setup:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system is dual-stack, with ABAP and JAVA sharing a single database instance.&lt;BR /&gt;On-prem backups are currently stored on NetApp, while the Azure environment will use Backint for HANA backups.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have a few specific queries:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Migration Strategy:&lt;BR /&gt;What is the recommended migration method for such a dual-stack setup?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Should we consider replication, backup/restore, or a hybrid approach?&lt;BR /&gt;How does replication work when both ABAP and JAVA share the same DB? Are there any special considerations?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Backup History Concerns:&lt;BR /&gt;In our DEV system, we used: DB restore for ABAP and SWPM export/import for JAVA&lt;BR /&gt;However, we noticed that the backup history was lost post-migration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If we use only DB restore (without replication), will the backup catalog/history be retained?&lt;BR /&gt;What is the recommended approach for PROD systems to ensure backup continuity and catalog integrity?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Backup Integration:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Are there any steps needed to ensure smooth transition from NetApp-based backups to Backint on Azure?&lt;BR /&gt;Will the existing backup catalog be usable post-migration, or does it require reinitialization?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’d appreciate your guidance on the most robust and supportable approach for this migration, especially considering the dual-stack nature and backup history implications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks &amp;amp; Regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;B&gt;Learn more about the SAP Support user and program &lt;A target="_blank" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/maximizing-the-power-of-sap-community-at-product-support/ba-p/13501276"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/B&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear customer,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Please refer to the answers below for your questions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What is the recommended migration method for such a dual-stack setup?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The recommended and the supported methods with SWPM can be found in the system copy guide:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SOFTWARE_PROVISIONING_MANAGER/30839dda13b2485889466316ce5b39e9/14678bf6e9a04f4f9dc3a1620e96c0b7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;System Copy Guides - Software Provisioning Manager 1.0&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;On the target side, for Java you can choose the backup restore option, but choose that the Database is restored.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With normal restore it won't work without SWPM tool, and the Java instance will not start.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Database instance installation is required with the Java instance.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Q: Should we consider replication, backup/restore, or a hybrid approach?&lt;BR /&gt;How does replication work when both ABAP and JAVA share the same DB?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thanks. I know that creating a&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;parameterized view could theoretically solve my problem (thanks for confirming!), but is there a way to do it solely with ABAP SQL Path Expression, just for my information and knowledge?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thanks. That's a quite complex solution for something which could be done in maybe 7 lines of ABAP code. Do you know if&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;there's a way to do it solely with ABAP SQL Path Expression, just for my information and knowledge?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello all,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;first time posting here, do not know if I have done everything correctly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We encountered an issue with our preference indicator in VBAP and VBRP in SAP S/4HANA. In our coding we use SAP standard functions to determine whether preference indicator should be set or not. These standard functions (example&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;/SAPSLL/SD0A_PREF_IND_DET)&lt;/SPAN&gt; use variable gc_true and gc_false, as well as lv_active type xfeld. These variables are hard-coded to X (gc_true) or empty (gc_false).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our issue lies in a change of the data element and domain of field PREFE in VBAP and VBRP. In our ECC environment the field PREFE has the data element PREAV which has the domain XFELD (values X and empty). Now, in our S/4 environment the same field has the data element PREFE with the domain PREFE. The domain PREFE has alphabetical values. We checked the table versions and saw that it was changed on 21.01.25 from SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Are we missing something? Do we maybe need to implement a SAP Note? How can we resolve this issue?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Yes, SAP can automatically trigger a re-release of a Purchase Requisition (PR) when you assign a contract (outline agreement) to it. This is because the system treats the assignment of a contract as a change to a release-relevant field. In standard SAP, the release strategy is based on classification (document type, account assignment, material group, source of supply, etc.). If any of these fields change, the release status is reset.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Why it is happening is because when you assign a contract to a PR, the system updates the source of supply information (e.g., contract number, item, vendor). The field Source of Supply (EBAN-KONNR, EBAN-KTPNR, EBAN-LIFNR) is release-relevant by default in many standard configurations. As soon as a release-relevant field changes, SAP cancels the existing approval and requires a new release — this is by design, to ensure approvers validate the new sourcing decision.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;You control this behavior in SPRO → Materials Management → Purchasing → Purchase Requisition → Release Procedure → Define Release Procedure for Purchase Requisitions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;SAP Help Portal – &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/af9ef57f504840d2b81be8667206d485/5634d5e7a337449c989b632e98f84abf-618.html?version=2023.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Workflows for Purchase Requisitions&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;- This is the official SAP Help documentation for configuring workflows and approvals in S/4HANA.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Go to SPRO → Financial Accounting (New) → Financial Accounting Global Settings (New) → Ledgers → Ledger → Define and Activate Non‑Leading Ledgers. Here you see which ledgers are defined and which company codes they are active for. You can deactivate a non‑leading ledger for a company code &lt;STRONG&gt;if no postings exist&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;For Asset Accounting, each ledger must be active in the chart of depreciation if you want to post asset values. If your ledger (e.g., EX) is not active in the chart of depreciation, it cannot be used for asset postings — which is why you’re seeing the inconsistency.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Check SAP note &lt;STRONG&gt;891144&lt;/STRONG&gt; which confirm that removal requires SAP consulting support, because it involves data deletion or system reset. If no postings exist, you can safely unassign the ledger from the company code in the customizing step above.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As we rapidly close in on this year’s &lt;A href="https://go4.events.sap.com/eur-sap-alm-summit-emea-2025/en_us/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP ALM Summit EMEA 2025&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; in &lt;STRONG&gt;Darmstadt&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Germany, all preparations are now done and dusted, the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://assets.dm.ux.sap.com/eur-sap-alm-summit-emea-2025/pdfs/agenda_2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;agenda&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; is set, and the event app is already alive and kicking.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you haven’t yet registered, this is your &lt;STRONG&gt;last chance to join&lt;/STRONG&gt; our annual event. If you’ve already signed up, as you probably know from previous years, it’s now time to &lt;STRONG&gt;build your agenda&lt;/STRONG&gt;, so head over to the &lt;A href="https://alm-summit-emea-2025.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/#/event" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;web app&lt;/A&gt; to call up the agenda, view speaker details, and build your own personalized schedule. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;As the event is in a new location this year, make sure you take a look at the floor plans and onsite guide in the app to familiarize yourself before arrival. And speaking of arrival, note that there will also be a &lt;STRONG&gt;Welcome Reception&lt;/STRONG&gt; on Monday October 20, the evening before the event itself, where you can already check in and network with fellow community members and experts. But that’s literally just the start…&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Agenda2025_v2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320902i3206850234940FCA/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Agenda2025_v2.png" alt="Agenda2025_v2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Something new for this year?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We take feedback from our ALM family seriously, so this year we will be offering &lt;STRONG&gt;hands-on&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;workshop&lt;/STRONG&gt; sessions and a &lt;STRONG&gt;Usability Test station&lt;/STRONG&gt; in parallel to the regular sessions. This is your chance to learn how to build a PoC for manual testing for instance, and to test key aspects yourself – helping to shape the future of SAP Cloud ALM for years to come. Proof that you don’t need to be an “influencer” to be an influencer. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Nevertheless, if you do want to showcase your skills and expertise to a bigger audience however, what better way than by securing yourself a &lt;/SPAN&gt;Solution Transformation Consultant Badge, which &lt;SPAN&gt;visitors once again have the chance of &lt;/SPAN&gt;obtaining on Day 3.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;It’s not a sprint, it’s an ALM-athon.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;…although we’re 100% sure countless dev sprints have gone into the amazing ideas that will be showcased by our awesome SAP Partners and finalists during the &lt;STRONG&gt;ALM-athon&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This infamous and eagerly-awaited summit showpiece has become a true highlight. Animal, witch, or indeed any other type of costume may not be mandatory per se but, as we saw last year, not only do they add to the fun and magic, they sure do put a huge smile on everyone’s faces. Last year saw Pinky and The Brain (aka &lt;STRONG&gt;NTT Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;) walk away as worthy winners with their wannabe-world-dominating “ALM Navigator”, so who knows what awaits us this year in what will be the 5th edition of the contest. Without doubt a highlight not to be missed – but if you &lt;EM&gt;did&lt;/EM&gt; miss it last year, why not get in the mood for this October by watching &lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xvm04N5QuY4" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;last year’s replay&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="The six ALM-athon 2024 finalists strutting their stuff on stage – each one a winner in our eyes" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320901i282746D2ECA41A6D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2024Almathon_v1.png" alt="The six ALM-athon 2024 finalists strutting their stuff on stage – each one a winner in our eyes" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;The six ALM-athon 2024 finalists strutting their stuff on stage – each one a winner in our eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Our new venue at the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.darmstadtium.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Darmstadtium&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; this year is fantastic, and we hope our agenda sessions are right on point.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello SAP Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'd like to discuss a common dilemma developers face when it comes to designing a dashboard in SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Should I design the dashboard such that it fits entirely within the browser window (Full-Page Fit)? or should I design the dashboard such that it has a scroll?&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Would the customer be okay with having to scroll up and down to see the contents of the dashboard?&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":face_with_rolling_eyes:"&gt;🙄&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, the design process begins even before we decide to click Create Story.&lt;BR /&gt;To Tackle this problem, I will be elaborating both the scenarios for you to make an informed decision while designing your next dashboard.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Difference between both the Dashboard Fit:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Assuming we are seeing the dashboard in a normal sized laptop screen [1366 x 768px] not a 1080p HD one. A&amp;nbsp;Full-Page Fit Dashboard&amp;nbsp;ensures all content is visible without scrolling, while a&amp;nbsp;Scrollable Dashboard&amp;nbsp;allows content to extend vertically or horizontally beyond the initial view, requiring user interaction to access additional information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This choice significantly impacts user experience and performance. Both has its own advantages and disadvantages. Let's dive deep to understand the pros and cons of each type.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Full-Page Fit Dashboard: (Everything visible in a single glance)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Full page.png" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317900i5A90E12A83002CEF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Full page.png" alt="Full page.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Here in the above screenshot, see how all the KPIs presented within a single screen and there is no scroll to the right and bottom of the dashboards. This means that it is well within the boundaries of our 1366 x 768 px canvas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advantages&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All KPIs are visible at a single glance, enabling quick decision-making.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No need to scroll, which is ideal for users who prefer a single-screen overview.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Each KPI has less room, potentially less real estate and more congestion.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All widgets are triggered simultaneously, sending backend requests that can strain system resources.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Heavy widgets like tables may take longer to load, making the dashboard appear sluggish.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Performance Statistics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All the KPIs visible in viewport have triggered a backend request and rendered.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It's like going to a restaurant and saying bring me everything you have, even when you know you won't be able to eat everything they bring. Wasteful.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":thumbs_down:"&gt;👎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Total render time ~9.5s&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Loading Full.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317904iE1D9BEA549328C60/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Loading Full.png" alt="Loading Full.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All the visible KPIs have triggered a backend request and are rendered at Frontend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dashboard with Scroll (You gotta scroll to see what you want)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Scroll Section 1" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317901iE6AB518252E0B520/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Scroll1.png" alt="Scroll Section 1" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Scroll Section 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Scroll Section 2" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317902iED81895D82CF2D8D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Scroll2.png" alt="Scroll Section 2" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Scroll Section 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here in the above screenshot, see how we have a scroll to the right of the dashboard. This means that the KPIs are spaced out more and exceeds the page's default height of 768px, therefore the user would get a scroll when accessing the dashboard.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advantages&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;More space per KPI allows for better viewability and detailed insights.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAC’s viewport loading ensures only visible widgets are triggered, reducing initial load time and backend traffic.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Less frequently used or heavier components can be placed lower on the page.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Users may miss the overall picture and need to scroll to compare KPIs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Scrolling back and forth can hinder quick analysis and decision-making.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Performance Statistics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All the KPIs that has been viewed initially have triggered a backend request and rendered. The Un scrolled portion doesn't trigger any backend request neither doesn't render until we preview it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This is like going to the restaurant and placing an order and post eating the main course you get to decide if you want to take on dessert. Only what is required is being consumed here. Resourceful&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":thumbs_up:"&gt;👍&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Total render time ~8s&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Scroll perfo.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317903i27DD3CCB64A6F510/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Scroll perfo.png" alt="Scroll perfo.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Only KPIs visible during initial preview has been rendered&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finding the Middle Ground: Tab Strips&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To balance usability and performance, developers can use&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tab Strip. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These are&amp;nbsp;container widgets used within a SAC story to organize content into separate, switchable tabs.&amp;nbsp;They allow users to view different components, such as charts or tables, within a single application by providing a navigation area to select and display the content of each tab.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Tab strip - summary section" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317905iC348C2D7822E0019/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Tab1.png" alt="Tab strip - summary section" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Tab strip - summary section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Tab strip - Table section" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317906i1CC36323DF17C5D5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Tab2.png" alt="Tab strip - Table section" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Tab strip - Table section&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here in the above screenshot, see how the dashboard is still fitted within the canvas and also having the benefits of loading what is required.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As we have also bifurcated the components into summary and table section. The heavier/Less frequently viewed KPIs are places in the subsequent tab strips, therefore reducing the initial load.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits of Tab Strips&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Essential KPIs are displayed upfront, while heavier or less frequently accessed components (e.g., raw data tables) are placed in separate tabs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAC’s default viewport loading ensures only visible components are triggered, reducing backend load and improving responsiveness.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tabs offer a cleaner and better UI/UX.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Performance Statistics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Only the Default tab strip KPIs have triggered a backend request and has been rendered. The heavier KPIs which hasn't been previewed is still untriggered and unrendered.&lt;BR /&gt;Total render time ~7.5s&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Tab perf1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317907i2530B4084DEE5820/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Tab perf1.png" alt="Tab perf1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Only the Default tab strip KPIs have triggered a backend request and has been rendered&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Principle: "What You See Is What Loads"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;SAC's viewport optimization&lt;/U&gt; means that only the visible components are loaded initially. This explains why Full-Page Fit dashboards can be performance intensive as everything is triggered at once. In contrast, scrollable dashboards and tab-based layouts defer loading of non-visible components, enhancing performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;However, it’s important to note that once a user navigates to hidden sections or tabs, those components will be triggered, potentially causing a brief delay.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Final Take away&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The choice between a Full-Page Fit and a Scrollable Dashboard should be guided by user requirements and usage patterns. Developers must engage with users' early phases in the design process to understand:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Which KPIs are most frequently accessed?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is a single-screen overview preferred?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Are users comfortable with scrolling or tab navigation?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this article was helpful. Which one do you prefer?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tachyonix Architecture and AI Interaction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, I would like to thank everyone who interacted with &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/reducing-weeks-to-minutes-ai-abap-and-low-code-in-sap-development/ba-p/14221758" target="_self"&gt;my previous post&lt;/A&gt; about AI, low-code platforms, and SAPUI5. As many asked for more details, this article dives deeper into Tachyonix’s architecture and how it interacts with LLM and &lt;STRONG&gt;Noam&lt;/STRONG&gt;, our AI assistant.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Challenge We Wanted to Solve&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the beginning, our goal was clear: to create a technology that could fully leverage the power of &lt;STRONG&gt;LLMs&lt;/STRONG&gt; without turning the developer into a hostage of code that is hard to maintain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Generating raw SAPUI5 code (the so-called &lt;EM&gt;vibe-coding&lt;/EM&gt;) may look attractive in the short term, but it quickly becomes a problem for evolution, support, and security.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is why we decided to integrate artificial intelligence not into the code itself, but into the &lt;STRONG&gt;specification and automation process&lt;/STRONG&gt; inside a low-code platform. This design allowed us to radically accelerate the development of SAP applications while preserving the simplicity and control that ABAP developers demand.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How AI Also Helps the ABAP Developer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rogeriobalassiano_0-1758477069176.png" style="width: 546px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317488iBC2656A1C4AE0CF0/image-dimensions/546x265?v=v2" width="546" height="265" role="button" title="rogeriobalassiano_0-1758477069176.png" alt="rogeriobalassiano_0-1758477069176.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Builder, Application, and Extended Vocabulary&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Tachyonix architecture is built on three pillars:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Builder&lt;/STRONG&gt; – where the ABAP developer configures data sources, models screens, and adjusts behaviors.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application (Viewer)&lt;/STRONG&gt; – a SAPUI5 renderer that interprets the &lt;STRONG&gt;extended vocabulary of annotations&lt;/STRONG&gt; and presents the interface in a Fiori-like style, strictly following SAP guidelines.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Layer (CDS Views)&lt;/STRONG&gt; – the data layer modeled by the ABAP developer, also through the Builder, with pushdown, ensuring performance and consistency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This design allows applications to be configured and rendered without the need to write JavaScript code. All logic for validation, determination, and execution remains in ABAP, preserving full control for the developer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rogeriobalassiano_1-1758477069179.png" style="width: 538px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317490iE1DC7495EEC8F088/image-dimensions/538x199?v=v2" width="538" height="199" role="button" title="rogeriobalassiano_1-1758477069179.png" alt="rogeriobalassiano_1-1758477069179.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Difference Compared to Vibe-Coding&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While other solutions focus on directly generating code, Tachyonix takes a different path:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We do &lt;STRONG&gt;not&lt;/STRONG&gt; generate raw SAPUI5 code.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We generate &lt;STRONG&gt;structured annotations&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which the Application interprets.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The developer keeps full control: still working with ABAP, CDS, classes, and FMs — but never with unreadable AI-generated code.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This ensures:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security&lt;/STRONG&gt; of the result.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Predictability&lt;/STRONG&gt; and adherence to SAP standards.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Continuous evolution&lt;/STRONG&gt; of the app within the low-code platform.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The ABAP Developer as the Protagonist&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has been repositioning the &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP developer&lt;/STRONG&gt; at the center of extensibility in S/4HANA — whether with new features in CDS or with Fiori Elements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tachyonix aligns with this movement, expanding the possibilities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The ABAPer models data (&lt;STRONG&gt;VDMs&lt;/STRONG&gt;).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Defines business rules (&lt;STRONG&gt;validations and determinations&lt;/STRONG&gt;).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configures screens in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Builder&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And the &lt;STRONG&gt;Application&lt;/STRONG&gt; delivers the final Fiori-like experience.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the end, the ABAP developer is the central gear:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;They define the logic.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;They control the runtime.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;They ensure the app’s quality.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How the Architecture Works in Practice&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Start with Noam&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The user describes what they need directly to &lt;STRONG&gt;Noam&lt;/STRONG&gt;, our AI assistant.&lt;BR /&gt;Example: “I need a report of pending sales orders.”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;LLM + RAG + MCP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The LLM, reinforced by a &lt;STRONG&gt;RAG mechanism&lt;/STRONG&gt;, queries the Tachyonix &lt;STRONG&gt;Knowledge Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt; and triggers tools registered in the &lt;STRONG&gt;MCP&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;Among them:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Package Tool&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; → identifies the correct ABAP package.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Data Source Tool&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; → suggests relevant CDS Views.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Field Retrieval Tool&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; → selects the appropriate fields.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Floorplan Tool&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; → recommends the most suitable Fiori layout.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;KPI Selection Tool&lt;/STRONG&gt; → determines whether any KPI should be included in the application and specifies which one.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Additional Information Tool&lt;/STRONG&gt; → checks if complementary information is required for the application and incorporates it into the specification.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Action Button Tool&lt;/STRONG&gt; → defines which action buttons should be available in the application (e.g., &lt;EM&gt;Approve&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Reject&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Download&lt;/EM&gt;), and links them to the appropriate ABAP logic or OData service.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conversion into Technical Specification&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;With the MCP tools, the LLM converts the user’s natural language description into a &lt;STRONG&gt;consolidated technical specification&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;Then, it executes a dedicated tool that automatically &lt;STRONG&gt;creates CDS&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;persists annotations&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enabling the Application to render the app later.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Builder&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The ABAP developer uses the &lt;STRONG&gt;Tachyonix Builder&lt;/STRONG&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;refine&lt;/STRONG&gt; data sources, screens, and business rules related to frontend behavior, &lt;STRONG&gt;extending the newly generated application&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The final application is not generated SAPUI5 code but a rendering via the &lt;STRONG&gt;Application&lt;/STRONG&gt;, our viewer based on the &lt;STRONG&gt;extended vocabulary of frontend annotations&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;This ensures full compliance with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori Guidelines&lt;/STRONG&gt;, with security and predictability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Business logic always runs in the &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Runtime&lt;/STRONG&gt;, allowing the same developer to model:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Determinations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Validations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Action executions (ABAP class, function module, or OData service)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Architecture – Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rogeriobalassiano_2-1758477069182.png" style="width: 557px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317489i19DB2B9BA7B07D64/image-dimensions/557x314?v=v2" width="557" height="314" role="button" title="rogeriobalassiano_2-1758477069182.png" alt="rogeriobalassiano_2-1758477069182.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Tachyonix architecture demonstrates that it is possible to bring together &lt;STRONG&gt;LLMs, RAG, MCP, low-code, and ABAP&lt;/STRONG&gt; in a cohesive and productive flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The result is a model where delivery time drops from &lt;STRONG&gt;weeks to minutes&lt;/STRONG&gt;, without sacrificing quality, security, or extensibility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach does not replace the developer — &lt;STRONG&gt;it empowers them&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;And in a market where &lt;STRONG&gt;time and flexibility&lt;/STRONG&gt; are competitive advantages, this is the new paradigm we are building.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;ps:&amp;nbsp;As an engineer, my passion is solving problems with code — not writing long texts. So yes, I had a little help from a LLM to put these ideas into words. Think of it as using the right tool for the job: ABAP for apps, LLM for writing &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;More than just a great Oasis song... this is a special case to watch out for when using HANA Geospatial features. This will be obvious to some, but here is something not particularly well documented, and I felt it was worth sharing.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-774872442" id="toc-hId-1632018976"&gt;So far but yet so close&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I'd been playing around with HANA's Geospatial features. The challenge of the day was joining information from about 100,000 weather stations around the globe with nearby world cities. Part of this meant holding geo-coordinate information (i.e. Longitude and Latitude pairs) in columns with data type ST_POINT(4326) – the WGS84 international standard, and using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ST_DISTANCE&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;method to return the distance between them. Easy enough.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Soon, I noticed something strange – although almost every city/station pair I had was behaving as expected, for a small handful I was getting some nonsensical results. Here are three such examples, along with a sensible result for Heidelberg (sorry SAP, Walldorf wasn’t in my table).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo1.png" style="width: 995px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320577i2B584BCA98A93080/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo1.png" alt="Geo1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the first example, my query was telling me that the nearest weather station to&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Auckland, New Zealand was in Moron de la Frontera... a Spanish Air Force Base… on the other side of the globe. And it thought that the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;distance was exactly zero&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My immediate assumption was that I had done something stupid in my select statements, or had formatted some data wrong. Wanting to sanity check, I looked up the co-ordinates for each area.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Auckland: (174.764980799, -36.850013)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Spanish weather station: (-5.6, 37.1833 ).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A quick check on Google maps showed that this was indeed correct… certainly both in their respective neighbourhoods.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So the co-ordinates seemed okay, and I even didn’t fall into the trap of getting the longitude/latitude order wrong.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(for the uninitiated, ST_POINT has these in (long,lat) order, the opposite of the more common way of presenting, which has (lat,lon). Something I find slightly annoying!)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clearly something else was the matter...&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo2.png" style="width: 745px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320592iB6D7F1A0052F2A45/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo2.png" alt="Geo2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-578358937" id="toc-hId-1435505471"&gt;Reproducing the issue&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I thought it would be a good idea to try manually constructing the points, in case my SELECT or Calculation View logic was faulty. This also gave a distance of zero.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo3.png" style="width: 542px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320579i3B29A18B4F3F526A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo3.png" alt="Geo3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now let’s move one of the points ever so slightly….&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo4.png" style="width: 595px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320580i33F048F01999E602/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo4.png" alt="Geo4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Holy moly! Now we see the correct distance of about 20,000 km.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What happened? All we did was shift one of the points about 5 km – you can see on the map it’s still in the same area.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo5.png" style="width: 766px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320581i2496FF431A1A10E6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo5.png" alt="Geo5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So what’s going on? Is it because military bases are somehow restricted areas on the WGS84 standard?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hmm… probably not. Let’s try with another one of my pairs which did not work.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here’s the city of Shenzhen, China (114.122123099, 22.55237051):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo6.png" style="width: 862px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320583i56EF0323D3A95DB3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo6.png" alt="Geo6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;And a weather station in La Quiaca, a sleepy town on the Argentina/Bolivia border. (-65.6, -22.1):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo7.png" style="width: 721px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320585i772A8B0806D7F180/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo7.png" alt="Geo7.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Again, these points manually give a distance of zero.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-381845432" id="toc-hId-1238991966"&gt;Antipodes&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At this point, I saw that the Wikipedia article for La Quiaca has an interesting sentence:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;“an approximate antipode to Hong Kong”.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo8.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320586i5BE475CF5C3DE996/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo8.png" alt="Geo8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;^see, I told you...&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For those unfamiliar with Asian geography, let’s zoom out of Shenzhen and see where it is…&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo9.png" style="width: 703px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320590iC9A5AF2D803E828E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo9.png" alt="Geo9.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Aha... right next to Hong Kong. So we seem to have found the culprit.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In all cases, the pairs which were showing as zero distance were about as far away as it is possible to get on the other side of the globe.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In these extreme situations, distance formulae tend to break down a little. Let's dig further into this.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-185331927" id="toc-hId-1042478461"&gt;Vincenty's Formula&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I believe the implementation of ST_DISTANCE in SAP HANA uses Vincenty’s Inverse Formula&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty%27s_formulae#Inverse_problem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;which you can read all about here.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The math may not mean much to you, but there is a little caveat at the end worth noting:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;“Between two nearly antipodal points, the iterative formula may fail to converge”. In other words… the equation fails for points on the opposite side of the globe.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;That's exactly what happened here.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To further back this up, I found an online calculator with an explicit use of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-vincenty.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Vincenty’s Formulae here&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It comes with a similar warning:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Vincenty’s inverse solution can fail on nearly antipodal points. Testing with&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/html/geodesic.html#testgeod" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Geographic­Lib test data&lt;/A&gt;, I’ve found this can happen with distances greater than 19,936&amp;nbsp;km, or within around 75&amp;nbsp;km of the antipodal point.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;And sure enough, my co-ordinate pairs are throwing a 'Not a Number' error.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Geo10.png" style="width: 643px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320588iB1B188F9A479924B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Geo10.png" alt="Geo10.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--11181578" id="toc-hId-845964956"&gt;Final Words&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So there you have it. If you are implementing any similar Geospatial projects, be sure to double-check and protect against antipodal failures.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In my case, I made a separate view to show the pairs giving exactly zero distance and manually confirmed the results.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I hope this saves someone a headache one day.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Good luck, and happy bug hunting!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;-Elliott&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Transaction &lt;STRONG&gt;IP30&lt;/STRONG&gt; allows you to schedule multiple maintenance plans in the background (batch job). If you adjust the start date / cycle date of the plans, IP30 will regenerate the calls and create new orders in bulk. This is the standard way to “bring forward” calls without touching each one manually.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;If the orders are already generated, you can use &lt;STRONG&gt;IW38&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Change PM Orders) with a selection variant. From there, you can mass‑change fields like Basic Start / Finish Dates and even Release status. This avoids opening each order individually.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
