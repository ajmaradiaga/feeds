    <content>&lt;P&gt;The journey to SAP S/4HANA can take different forms, depending on your organization's goals, existing system landscape, and appetite for change. Whether you're looking to redesign your processes entirely, preserve your current system, or take a more flexible, hybrid approach, selecting the right migration strategy is critical.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we'll explore the key differences between greenfield, brownfield, and bluefield conversions, helping you determine which path aligns best with your business needs as you transition to S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Greenfield Approach:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A greenfield approach involves starting from scratch. It’s a fresh implementation of S/4HANA, where the system is built without carrying over any existing customizations, processes, or data. Companies use greenfield when they want to redesign their business processes entirely or when they are moving from a non-SAP system to S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Brownfield Approach:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A brownfield approach involves a system conversion, upgrading the existing SAP ERP (ECC) system to S/4HANA. It retains most of the existing customizations, processes, and data, but moves them onto the S/4HANA platform.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Companies opt for brownfield when they want to retain existing processes and customizations but upgrade to S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Features:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It's an in-place migration, where you upgrade the existing system rather than rebuilding or starting fresh.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Keeps historical data, configurations, and custom developments in place.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Suitable for companies looking to maintain continuity and minimize disruptions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Less costly and faster than a Greenfield approach but may carry over technical debt or outdated processes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use Case&lt;/STRONG&gt;: When an organization wants to preserve its existing investments and customizations while upgrading the core to S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bluefield Approach:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The bluefield approach is a hybrid of greenfield and brownfield. It involves selective data and process migration, allowing companies to retain some legacy processes and data while adopting new ones.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When companies want to modernize certain parts of their processes but also preserve critical customizations and data from the old system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Features:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It allows for selective data migration, enabling you to bring over relevant historical data and customizations without carrying over everything.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Offers the flexibility to redesign and optimize parts of the system while retaining valuable aspects from the legacy system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduces downtime compared to Greenfield and allows better customization compared to Brownfield.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Often involves the use of specialized tools to filter out unwanted data and processes, enabling selective transformation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use Case&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Ideal for organizations that want to take advantage of S/4HANA's new features while selectively transferring necessary custom developments, processes, and data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Other Approaches&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Selective Data Transition: This is sometimes considered a variant of bluefield, where specific data and configurations are migrated rather than doing a full system conversion or a full reimplementation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Phased or Iterative Migrations: In these cases, parts of the system or specific modules are converted incrementally to S/4HANA, rather than performing a full conversion all at once.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary of differences:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GRCwithRaghu_0-1727183635183.png" style="width: 654px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/170609iF1B0679CC92D2598/image-dimensions/654x542?v=v2" width="654" height="542" role="button" title="GRCwithRaghu_0-1727183635183.png" alt="GRCwithRaghu_0-1727183635183.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These three approaches (greenfield, brownfield, bluefield) cover the main strategies for S/4HANA migrations, and each organization chooses based on its specific needs, resources, and goals.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So what to choose? My experience and industry recommendation is Bluefield, which offers more flexibility and the ability to modernize selectively, whereas Brownfield is faster but less transformative.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q) SAP is speaking a lot about Clean Core. Which one is more relevant in this context?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As per my knowledge, the Bluefield approach is more aligned with the Clean Core concept in SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here’s why:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Clean Core Concept: The idea of a clean core is to minimize or completely avoid customizations in the core SAP system, ensuring that the core remains as standard as possible. Any required customizations should be done using side-by-side extensions or through the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), rather than modifying the core directly. This enables easier future upgrades, better system stability, and enhanced use of cloud innovations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bluefield’s Relevance:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In a Bluefield migration, you have the ability to selectively migrate custom developments, business processes, and data. This allows you to critically evaluate which customizations are truly necessary and eliminate unnecessary custom code that would otherwise clutter the system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It supports modernization of your landscape by allowing you to adopt new, standard SAP best practices for certain areas, while keeping only the required custom elements in external environments or using modern extensibility frameworks.You can move toward a clean core by offloading custom code into more flexible extension options, ensuring the core SAP S/4HANA system remains standard and optimized for upgrades.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the other hand, Brownfield typically carries over all existing configurations and customizations, which is counterproductive to maintaining a clean core, as it could perpetuate legacy customizations and technical debt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thus, Bluefield is the better choice if your goal is to implement a Clean Core strategy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q) What additional points I must consider with regards to Security &amp;amp; Authorization in SAP?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When considering Security &amp;amp; Authorization in an SAP S/4HANA migration or conversion project, whether it's Bluefield or Brownfield, there are critical factors you must address to ensure the system remains secure and compliant post-migration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Role Design and Optimization:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Review Existing Roles&lt;/EM&gt;: In a Brownfield migration, all legacy roles and authorizations are typically carried over. This can result in outdated or redundant roles that do not align with S/4HANA's simplified processes. For a Clean Core strategy, assess and clean up roles to ensure they match new processes and business needs.&lt;BR /&gt;• &lt;EM&gt;Simplified Data Model&lt;/EM&gt;: S/4HANA has a simplified data model, which may affect authorization objects linked to tables, transactions, and business processes. You will need to map legacy roles to the new S/4HANA authorization objects.&lt;BR /&gt;• &lt;EM&gt;Optimize for Fiori&lt;/EM&gt;: S/4HANA heavily uses SAP Fiori as the front-end, which comes with a role-based access control (RBAC) model. Ensure that roles are optimized for Fiori apps, as Fiori apps typically involve multiple underlying backend authorizations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Clean Core and Extensibility:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Avoid Custom Code in the Core&lt;/STRONG&gt;: With the Clean Core concept, custom developments should be moved to external platforms (e.g., SAP Business Technology Platform). Ensure that custom authorization objects related to those developments are also managed outside of the core, where applicable.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extension Model&lt;/STRONG&gt;: If your migration uses SAP’s new side-by-side extensibility framework or enhancements via BTP, you must ensure that proper security mechanisms are in place for these external apps, including secure communication, OAuth, and SAML for authentication.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Segregation of Duties (SoD) and GRC Alignment:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Review SoD Conflicts&lt;/EM&gt;: S/4HANA introduces new functionalities and removes obsolete ones, so it's essential to review and update your SoD rulesets to account for these changes. Ensure that your SAP GRC Access Control is aligned with the new S/4HANA environment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;GRC Integration&lt;/EM&gt;: Make sure that GRC Access Control, Process Control, and Risk Management are integrated into the new environment to continuously monitor authorizations, SoD, and other risk factors.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;NOTE: With the new SAP GRC embedded model, all the GRC components such as AC, PC, and RM will become embedded on S4 HANA. You may also consider evaluating it, if your S4 HANA migration doesn’t have it in the list.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. New Security Features in S/4HANA:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;S/4HANA Security Innovations&lt;/EM&gt;: Leverage S/4HANA’s enhanced security features like Context-Based Authorizations (CBA), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and UI Masking or UI Logging to protect sensitive data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Cloud and Hybrid Security&lt;/EM&gt;: If you are moving to S/4HANA Cloud or adopting a hybrid model, ensure you follow SAP's best practices for cloud security (including SAP Cloud Identity Services) and managing secure access to both on-premise and cloud systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Compliance and Data Privacy:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Data Protection Compliance&lt;/EM&gt;: Ensure that the authorization design complies with GDPR, CCPA, or any other applicable data privacy regulations. This includes defining clear roles for access to personal or sensitive data and implementing data masking or encryption mechanisms where necessary.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Audit and Logging:&lt;/EM&gt; S/4HANA offers enhanced capabilities for audit logging and monitoring. Ensure that proper logging of sensitive transactions and authorization changes is implemented to facilitate compliance audits.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. SAML, OAuth, and Single Sign-On (SSO):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Enable SSO&lt;/EM&gt;: Ensure that Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions, such as SAML 3.0 or OAuth 2.0, are correctly set up for secure and seamless access across different systems. This is particularly important in environments that use both cloud and on-premise systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Identity Authentication and Provisioning&lt;/EM&gt;: Consider using SAP Cloud Identity Authentication and Identity Provisioning Services for secure and centralized user management across your SAP and non-SAP applications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. User Experience and Authorization Consistency:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Consistent User Experience&lt;/EM&gt;: Since S/4HANA relies heavily on Fiori applications, ensure that users have consistent authorization experiences across different devices (mobile, desktop) and application layers (back-end, Fiori, etc.).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Catalog and Group Management&lt;/EM&gt;: In Fiori, roles are managed using catalogs and groups (spaces and pages). You should make sure the Fiori launchpad roles are properly configured to give users access only to the apps they need.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Testing and Validation:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Security Testing&lt;/EM&gt;: Post-migration, conduct rigorous security testing, including penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and role-based access reviews, to ensure that all aspects of the new system, including extensions and external apps, are secure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Authorization Testing:&lt;/EM&gt; Run authorization testing to ensure that users have only the access they need and that there are no excessive privileges carried over from legacy systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;By addressing these security and authorization concerns, you can ensure that your SAP S/4HANA migration is secure, compliant, and optimized for modern business processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q) What is context based authorization?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Context-Based Authorization (CBA) in SAP refers to a dynamic approach to controlling access based on the context in which a user is attempting to perform an action. Unlike traditional role-based authorization, which grants or restricts access solely based on predefined roles and permissions, CBA takes into account additional contextual factors at the time of the authorization check.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key Elements of Context-Based Authorization:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Dynamic Contextual Factors:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CBA goes beyond static roles and evaluates additional parameters like:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Location&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Where the user is logging in from (e.g., specific countries or regions).&lt;BR /&gt;Time: The time of day or the business period during which the user is trying to access the system (e.g., access during business hours vs. after-hours).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Device&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The type of device the user is using (e.g., laptop, mobile, or tablet).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User Attributes&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Attributes tied to the user profile, such as department, job function, or security clearance level.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Sensitivity&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Sensitivity level of the data being accessed (e.g., financial vs. non-sensitive information).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This means that even if a user has a role that grants them access, the system can deny or modify their access depending on the context.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Granular Control:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CBA allows for fine-grained access control, meaning that specific conditions can be set for individual transactions or actions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For example, a financial manager may be allowed to approve expenses up to a certain amount but only when connected to the corporate network and during business hours. If they try to approve the expense remotely or after-hours, the authorization may be restricted.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Improved Security:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adaptive Security&lt;/STRONG&gt;: By factoring in real-time contextual information, CBA improves security by adapting to potential risks. For example, the system might detect that an access request is coming from an unfamiliar location or outside normal business hours and take precautionary measures such as denying access or triggering additional authentication.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Risk Mitigation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: It helps mitigate risks by ensuring that sensitive transactions or data can only be accessed under secure, controlled conditions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. Flexibility and Compliance:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Regulatory Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Many industries are subject to strict compliance regulations that may require dynamic access controls, especially concerning sensitive data like Personally Identifiable Information (PII). CBA helps meet these requirements by ensuring that access to data is aligned with specific contextual conditions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Flexibility:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Organizations can adapt access controls to meet business requirements without hardcoding rules in the system, providing flexibility to handle exceptional situations without compromising security.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example Use Cases:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Field Service Management: A field engineer may be allowed to access customer maintenance data while they are on-site at a customer’s location, but not when they are outside the location or during non-working hours.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Finance and HR: A payroll manager might have access to salary data but only within the secure office network. If the manager tries to access the same information from a public Wi-Fi network, access could be blocked or restricted to read-only.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sensitive Transactions: A sales manager can create purchase orders for high-value items but only from approved devices. If they use a mobile device, they may only be able to view sales reports but not execute high-value transactions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implementation in SAP:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dynamic Authorization Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;: CBA is often implemented using a combination of SAP Authorization Objects, ABAP coding for dynamic checks, and Security Policies that define context-based rules.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP GRC&lt;/STRONG&gt;: In some cases, CBA can be integrated with SAP Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) tools to enforce risk-based authorizations, ensuring that the risk profile of the transaction and context is evaluated before access is granted.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration with Fiori and BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;: For systems using SAP Fiori or the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), context-based rules can be implemented to dynamically grant or restrict access to specific Fiori apps based on contextual information.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced Security&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Limits access based on real-time conditions, reducing the attack surface.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reduced Risk of Misuse&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Controls over sensitive transactions and data access prevent unauthorized activities even from users with high-level roles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Increased Flexibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Business processes remain fluid without hardcoded access restrictions, as the system adjusts access based on the situation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Better Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Ensures that sensitive information is accessed in a controlled, compliant manner.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Context-Based Authorization in SAP provides dynamic and adaptive access control based on real-time contextual factors, enhancing security while maintaining flexibility and compliance in the organization’s access management strategy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wrapping up:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In conclusion, when it comes to your S/4HANA transformation journey, the strategy you choose depends on your organization’s unique needs and future landscape. Each approach offers its own set of advantages and drawbacks, so it’s not a simple, one-size-fits-all comparison.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The key is to select a strategy that aligns best with your goals. However, one critical factor to consider is maintaining a "&lt;STRONG&gt;Clean Core&lt;/STRONG&gt;" This principle is likely to become a major focus in future transformations, and adhering to it now can help you avoid unnecessary rework down the road.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In short, while there are many ways to approach your S/4HANA transformation, prioritizing a Clean Core can streamline the process and future-proof your system.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-921838140"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP HANA is a high-performance in-memory database that supports real-time analytics and transactions. It is widely used by enterprises to run their critical business applications and processes. However, SAP HANA systems also require high availability and disaster recovery solutions to ensure business continuity and data protection in case of failures or disasters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Azure is a cloud platform that offers a range of services and features to host, manage, and scale SAP HANA systems. Azure provides high-performance virtual machines, storage, networking, and security options that can meet the requirements of SAP HANA workloads. However, Azure does not offer a native high availability solution for SAP HANA systems, which means that customers need to use third-party tools or custom scripts to achieve high availability for their SAP HANA databases on Azure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SIOS LifeKeeper is a proven high availability and disaster recovery solution that can protect SAP HANA systems on Azure. SIOS LifeKeeper can monitor, detect, and recover from failures of SAP HANA instances, virtual machines, storage, network, or Azure services. SIOS LifeKeeper can also replicate data between primary and secondary SAP HANA systems, and perform automatic or manual failover and failback operations. SIOS LifeKeeper can integrate with Azure services such as Azure Load Balancer, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure Site Recovery to provide a comprehensive and reliable high availability solution for SAP HANA systems on Azure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-725324635"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before you can configure and deploy a highly available SAP HANA system on Azure using SIOS LifeKeeper, you need to have the following prerequisites:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;An Azure subscription and an Azure account with sufficient permissions to create and manage resources.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A SAP HANA license and installation media.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A SIOS LifeKeeper license and installation media.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Two or more Azure virtual machines that meet the SAP HANA hardware and software requirements. You can use the Azure Marketplace to create SAP HANA certified virtual machines.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A shared storage solution that supports SAP HANA data and log volumes. You can use Azure NetApp Files, Azure Files, or Azure Shared Disks as shared storage options.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A network solution that allows communication between the SAP HANA systems and the SIOS LifeKeeper nodes. You can use Azure Virtual Network, Azure VPN Gateway, or Azure ExpressRoute as network options.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A load balancer solution that can distribute traffic to the SAP HANA systems and the SIOS LifeKeeper nodes. You can use Azure Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway, or Azure Traffic Manager as load balancer options.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-528811130"&gt;Configuration Steps&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;After you have prepared the prerequisites, you can follow these steps to configure and deploy a highly available SAP HANA system on Azure using SIOS LifeKeeper:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Install SAP HANA on the primary virtual machine and configure the SAP HANA data and log volumes on the shared storage.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Install SAP ASCS &amp;nbsp;on the primary virtual machine and SAP ERS on Secondary Virtual Machine and /sapmnt on the shared storage.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Install SIOS LifeKeeper on the primary virtual machine and join it to a SIOS LifeKeeper cluster.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a SIOS LifeKeeper SAP HANA resource hierarchy on the primary virtual machine and configure the SAP HANA instance details and the shared storage paths.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Install SAP HANA on the secondary virtual machine and configure the SAP HANA data and log volumes on the shared storage.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Install SIOS LifeKeeper on the secondary virtual machine and join it to the same SIOS LifeKeeper cluster as the primary virtual machine.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Extend the SIOS LifeKeeper SAP HANA resource hierarchy from the primary virtual machine to the secondary virtual machine and configure the replication mode and the failover policies.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure the load balancer to direct traffic to the SAP HANA systems and the SIOS LifeKeeper nodes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Test the high availability and disaster recovery scenarios by simulating failures and verifying the failover and failback operations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Architecture Design&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

Over time, even though there may be free memory available in the Old Generation, fragmentation can prevent the JVM from allocating large contiguous memory blocks&lt;/FONT&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Long GC Pauses and Concurrent GC Phases&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We observe &lt;STRONG&gt;long GC times&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;One GC event took &lt;STRONG&gt;5.44 seconds&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;5962034&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;K&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;71890&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;K&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;(&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;7340032&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;K&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;,&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;5.4469845&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;secs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;]&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;16939193&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;K&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;13683627&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;K&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;(&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;24117248&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;K&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;,&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;5.4474075&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;secs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This long pause indicates that garbage collection is struggling to free memory, which could be due to a large number of objects being tenured (moved to Old Generation) or due to fragmentation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1202161138"&gt;Why is the Job Failing?&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even though the total heap space seems adequate, the following issues are contributing to the failure:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fragmentation in the Old Generation (CMS Collector)&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CMS is prone to &lt;STRONG&gt;fragmentation&lt;/STRONG&gt; because it doesn’t compact memory. If there is fragmentation in the Old Generation, the JVM may not be able to find a&lt;FONT color="#FFFF00"&gt; co&lt;FONT color="#339966"&gt;ntiguous block of memory large enough to allocate new objects, even though the total available memory&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color="#339966"&gt; seems sufficient.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#339966"&gt;When CMS cannot allocate memory in the Old Generation due to fragment&lt;/FONT&gt;ation, the JVM will trigger &lt;STRONG&gt;GC (Allocation Failure)&lt;/STRONG&gt; events, and eventually, if the job needs a large contiguous block of memory, it will fail.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;High Old Generation Usage&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#339966"&gt;In the logs, we see the Old Generation usage grows to about &lt;STRONG&gt;13.6 GB&lt;/STRONG&gt; (out of 16 GB). While there’s technically &lt;STRONG&gt;2.4 GB&lt;/STRONG&gt; of free space, fragmentation might prevent the JVM from allocating that space efficiently.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Young Generation Full&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#339966"&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Young Generation (ParNew)&lt;/STRONG&gt; is constantly reaching its capacity, triggering GC.

These long GC pauses indicate that the JVM is spending significant time in garbage collection and is struggling to free up space.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Concurrent Mark-Sweep Phases&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#339966"&gt;CMS phases like &lt;STRONG&gt;Initial Mark, Concurrent Mark, Preclean, Sweep&lt;/STRONG&gt; are happening continuously, which suggests high memory churn. If these phases are interrupted or fail to clear enough space, the JVM won’t have enough available memory to allocate new objects for your job.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then to get more details of memory issue, you can use jvmmon tool -- I have used&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;command: print memhist, and below is the screen from that, let's check what is in this screen?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AkumaryafirAk_0-1729843780307.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/183555iAFA69EA7C8226B5F/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="AkumaryafirAk_0-1729843780307.png" alt="AkumaryafirAk_0-1729843780307.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1005647633"&gt;Breakdown of the JVM Metrics:&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-938216847"&gt;1. &lt;STRONG&gt;heap-comm and heap-used&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;heap-comm (Committed Heap)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This is the total amount of memory reserved (or committed) for the &lt;STRONG&gt;Java heap&lt;/STRONG&gt;. In this case, it shows &lt;STRONG&gt;23.0g&lt;/STRONG&gt; (23 GB), meaning the JVM has reserved 23 GB of memory for the heap.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;heap-used (Used Heap)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This represents the amount of memory actually being used in the heap. It is shown as &lt;STRONG&gt;10.9g&lt;/STRONG&gt; (10.9 GB), meaning 10.9 GB of the 23 GB heap is currently in use.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-741703342"&gt;2. &lt;STRONG&gt;meta-comm and meta-used&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;meta-comm (Committed MetaSpace)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The &lt;STRONG&gt;MetaSpace&lt;/STRONG&gt; is an area of memory used by the JVM to store class metadata (class definitions, methods, etc.). This value represents how much MetaSpace has been reserved. It shows &lt;STRONG&gt;938m&lt;/STRONG&gt; (938 MB).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;meta-used (Used MetaSpace)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This is the amount of memory actually being used in MetaSpace. It's listed as &lt;STRONG&gt;674m&lt;/STRONG&gt; (674 MB), meaning that 674 MB of the 938 MB committed space is being used.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-545189837"&gt;3. &lt;STRONG&gt;meta-csc and meta-csu&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;meta-csc (Class Space Committed)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This represents the memory committed for storing class metadata specifically for the classes loaded by the JVM. In this case, it's &lt;STRONG&gt;117m&lt;/STRONG&gt; (117 MB).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;meta-csu (Class Space Used)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This is the amount of that space actually being used by loaded classes. The value is &lt;STRONG&gt;71m&lt;/STRONG&gt; (71 MB), meaning that 71 MB out of the 117 MB committed class space is currently in use.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-348676332"&gt;4. &lt;STRONG&gt;meta-gctr (GC Threshold)&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;meta-gctr&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This represents the &lt;STRONG&gt;GC threshold&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the MetaSpace. It's the point at which a &lt;STRONG&gt;garbage collection (GC)&lt;/STRONG&gt; will be triggered to reclaim unused class metadata. In your case, the value is &lt;STRONG&gt;1.6g&lt;/STRONG&gt; (1.6 GB). This means that when MetaSpace usage approaches this value, the JVM may trigger GC to free up unused class metadata.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-152162827"&gt;5. &lt;STRONG&gt;code (Code Cache)&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;code (Code Cache Committed)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The &lt;STRONG&gt;Code Cache&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a special region where the JVM stores compiled native code generated by the &lt;STRONG&gt;Just-In-Time (JIT)&lt;/STRONG&gt; compiler. This value represents how much space is reserved for the code cache. In this case, it's &lt;STRONG&gt;230m&lt;/STRONG&gt; (230 MB).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--44350678"&gt;6. &lt;STRONG&gt;nmt-mlc, nmt-map, nmt-gc, nmt-oth, nmt-ovh&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;These values relate to &lt;STRONG&gt;Native Memory Tracking (NMT)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a diagnostic feature of the JVM used to track memory allocation outside the Java heap.&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;nmt-mlc&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Memory allocated via the malloc function by the HotSpot JVM.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;nmt-map&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Memory allocated by memory-mapped files (mmap).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;nmt-gc&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Memory allocated due to GC overhead (malloc and mmap) by the JVM.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;nmt-oth&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Memory allocations that are categorized as "other" (such as direct byte buffers or unsafe memory allocations).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;nmt-ovh&lt;/STRONG&gt;: NMT tracking overhead.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;These fields are only populated when NMT is active, but they are not shown in this log excerpt.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--240864183"&gt;7. &lt;STRONG&gt;jthr-num and jthr-nd&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;jthr-num (Number of Java Threads)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The total number of active threads in the JVM, including both daemon and non-daemon threads. It shows &lt;STRONG&gt;391&lt;/STRONG&gt; threads in this case.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;jthr-nd (Non-Daemon Threads)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The number of &lt;STRONG&gt;non-daemon&lt;/STRONG&gt; threads (i.e., threads that prevent the JVM from shutting down when they are running). In your data, this is &lt;STRONG&gt;341&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--437377688"&gt;8. &lt;STRONG&gt;jthr-cr (Threads Created)&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;jthr-cr (Threads Created [delta])&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The number of threads created since the last measurement (delta means the change in value between two data points). In this snapshot, it is &lt;STRONG&gt;0&lt;/STRONG&gt;, meaning no new threads were created since the last check.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1131608288"&gt;9. &lt;STRONG&gt;jthr-st (Thread Stack Reserved)&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;jthr-st&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This refers to the total reserved size of Java thread stacks, which is not shown here as the [nmt] section is inactive.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1328121793"&gt;10. &lt;STRONG&gt;cldg-num and cldg-anon&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;cldg-num (Classloader Data Number)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The number of &lt;STRONG&gt;ClassLoader Data&lt;/STRONG&gt; instances in the JVM. This value indicates how many class loaders are actively managing classes. It's not displayed in this log snippet.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;cldg-anon (Anonymous ClassLoader Data)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The number of anonymous class loader data instances. These are typically used for dynamically generated classes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1524635298"&gt;11. &lt;STRONG&gt;cls-num, cls-ld, cls-uld&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;cls-num (Classes Loaded)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The total number of classes currently loaded by the JVM, including instance and array classes.

The blog is updated on a daily basis, I use it as my own Toolbox and if it helps others then that's great. The subject is so big that it spilled over in to the comments. The goal is one page so that it can be searched with CTRL-F. If you need something and cannot find it, then write in the comments what you are looking for or send me a DM and I will show you where it is and if I don't know somebody else will.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The interesting thing is, as we move towards 2026, the move to S/4HANA is no longer only about S/4HANA Private (or Public) Cloud Edition or S/4HANA Cloud Private or RISE or whatever you call it, the move to S/4 has turned into a modernisation of the whole IT Platform.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Look at this presentation of "&lt;EM&gt;Transition to S/4HANA&lt;/EM&gt;" from &lt;STRONG&gt;2017&lt;/STRONG&gt;.....&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://assets.dm.ux.sap.com/bg-sap-professional-day/pdfs/04_transition_scenarious_and_best_practices.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The Path to S/4HANA: Transition Scenarios and Best Practices&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AndySilvey_0-1758090621619.png" style="width: 768px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315617i5ACBC984569DBE09/image-dimensions/768x416/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="768" height="416" role="button" title="AndySilvey_0-1758090621619.png" alt="AndySilvey_0-1758090621619.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Back then, we were only thinking about the "&lt;EM&gt;upgrade to S/4HANA&lt;/EM&gt;", back then in 2017 the SAP Cloud Platform, now the SAP BTP Business Technology Platform was in its infancy and basically only SAP Cloud Platform Integration and Mobile Services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, let's say 9 years later, coming in to 2026, the move to S/4 is triggering a modernisation (or transformation) of the whole IT Stack/.Tool Set, the S/4 as the Core and everything around it from Data (Master Data), Integration (APIs/Events), Security (System/BTP Hardening, E2E Integration, Users RnA, Provisioning), Extension/Custom Development (Clean Core), Monitoring, User Experience,&amp;nbsp; Reporting &amp;amp; Analytics, Operations, Organisation,&amp;nbsp; and of course Innovation, where innovation is lead by AI in all of its forms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And it's not only the S/4HANA on RISE anymore, it's all of the OnPremise Editions moving to RISE Private Cloud Editions, not many years ago we were unsure of the future of products like SAP GRC AC and now we can see that SAP GRC2026 is coming and that will have the same end of life as the S/4HANA, currently 2040, and where will we be running that, as a Private Cloud Edition on RISE ECS. And it's the same for the rest of the products like GTS, ATTP etc, if their end of life is 2040 then they will be moving to PCE RISE ECS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And what about the BW's ?&amp;nbsp; Our legacy BW's BW on HANA, BW/4HANA are going to move to the BDC Business Data Cloud as PCE Private Cloud Editions on BDC. And so, this subject is evolving before our eyes. This is interesting, BW's are not going to RISE ECS Private Cloud, they are going to BDC Private Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What we are part of is, in my opinion, is a once in a generation, once in a lifetime technology change and learning opportunity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And so this blog, is here to help me, and others, across the holistic subject of SAP modernisation. There is so much to learn, so many new things, and the majority of it is on this page. The page is updated on a daily basis with everything new that I touch are learn.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So let's get in to it...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are so many myths and misunderstandings about RISE, hopefully this work will shine more light on the subject.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The goal of this work is to provide a SAP S/4 RISE &amp;amp; BTP "1 Pager" for all of us Customer/System Integrator side folks who are on this journey.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where you are coming from and going to as a SAP Customer and as an Individual...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="RISE with SAP Transforming to SAP Business Suite.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/229146iB4C9C9D4A1C926D8/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="RISE with SAP Transforming to SAP Business Suite.png" alt="RISE with SAP Transforming to SAP Business Suite.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Business Suite Advantage&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/pdf/asset/preview/mEz8n1W?h=&amp;amp;ltr=a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/pdf/asset/preview/mEz8n1W?h=&amp;amp;ltr=a&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For me, there are at least five high level dimensions to this S/4 RISE BTP journey:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;SAP Next Generation ERP - Getting to S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;SAP Managed Cloud Infrastructure -&amp;nbsp;

Intelligent Technologies &amp;amp; Automation &amp;amp; New Innovations &amp;amp; RoadMap Opportunities - get them as soon as possible across all dimensions - functions - units&amp;nbsp; - domains - processes&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All five of the dimensions, and more, are covered in this 1 pager.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Moving quickly from those five high level dimensions and down in to the lower level engine room impact of the S/4HANA RISE BTP journey,&amp;nbsp; it must be clearly understood,&amp;nbsp; that, an S/4HANA RISE Program is actually all of this and more....&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Project Management / Program Management Transformation&amp;nbsp; - the program is huge and has a specific proven approach, Activate, which people need to learn&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Data Transformation - the Data is changing, and the structures&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Process Transformation - processes are changing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Technical Basis Transformation - Basis technologies are changing and how you do Basis&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;an Integration Transformation - integrations (API Events) and the tools (Broker) are changing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Hosting Transformation - hosting is changing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a User Experience Transformation - User Experience and User Interfacee is changing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;an Operations Transformation - how you do Operations is changing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Security Transformation - Security is changing, eg how to secure end to end API integrations across Authentication and Authorisation at all layers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Monitoring Transformation - monitoring is changing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Tools Transformation - the tools you use are changing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Custom Development (Extensions) Transformation - how you do extensions and where is changing&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;an Organisational Transformation (whether you like it or not) - your organisation will have to change, the old set up will be inefficient&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Roles &amp;amp; Responsibilities Transformation - roles will change&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a People Transformation - people will need new skills&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a Testing Transformation - there will be so much testing required - end to end&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a New Technology Transformation - there will be so much new tech starting with Joule....&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a to-be-architecture Legacy System transformation - as in legacy which remains as transition or part of the to-be will need to adapt&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How to solve that ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;The very first thing to do is read and digest SAP's &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/04/084bb1a5-6a7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;10 Underlying Quality Principles.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Implementing and Migrating to and Running S/4 PCE on RISE for the last three years, there is so much to learn and the SAP technology is changing faster these days than I have seen in my whole career, there is so much to keep up with, and similarly for the BTP, having been doing BTP (or as it was the SAP Cloud Platform) for 7 years, the BTP is moving very fast, new Services, existing Services evolving.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The two subjects are combined, SAP S/4HANA PCE on RISE with BTP, because in my eyes the two go hand in hand, S/4HANA PCE on RISE is the next generation of the previous On-Premise ERP offerings from SAP, and the BTP contains the next generation of Applications which we will all use with the S/4HANA PCE on RISE.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And then, since we are on this RISE journey, we are going to need to change our SAP CoE organisation, the existing SAP CoE setup will not be optimal for working with RISE/ECS, and so there's a section on SAP Organisational Change Management, SAP Center of Excellence, and SAP North Star Architecture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP North Star Architecture Service will safe guard the whole journey, from evaluation to run and everything in between, if you have the money, it's a must have, on the other hand, can you afford to go on the S/4 RISE BTP journey and not invest in safe guarding with the SAP North Star Architecture Service ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And then, the final section is lessons learned :-), what can we learn from previous implementations and bring to the next implementation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In my whole career I have never seen the pace of new SAP Technology move so fast and so wide. One of the phenomena which never ceases to amaze me these days is as the front end and user experience becomes easier, the back complexity goes up exponentially, as we make the front end &lt;A

RISE&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;The goal of this section is to help the SAP Customer who is thinking about RISE to build a clear picture and understanding of what the responsibilities are and what the segregation of duties are.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;A lot of people seem to think that on RISE the Customer won't need a Basis Team, well, far from it, on RISE the Customer obviously won't need so many Basis people, but, and the big but is, the Customer will need exceptionally qualified and experienced Basis people who at the same time have a very good maturity and discipline in their behaviour. One of my biggest lessons, and there are many many learnings, has been, with RISE, due to the nature of the shared responsibilities, there is very little room for trial and error in the Basis Domain, and the Basis Team need to put massive effort in to proper planning and preparation of activities and understand who will do what bases upon the segregation of duties between SAP and the Customer. There is no room for trial and error when doing new things in the Basis area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;So, we could write a book about that, but we are here to share useful documentation, so here it comes...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition Security and Compliance&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;Don't be deceived by the title, this document contains some golden information, anybody wanting to understand who does what with RISE, here are pictures you need, these picture show where your responsibilities are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;We start with a higher level view which is from the RISE OnBoarding Handbook&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://d.dam.sap.com/a/aW26pWQ/Onboarding%20Handbook%20.pdf?rc=10&amp;amp;inline=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Onboarding Handbook .pdf&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SAP ECS RISE Enterprise Cloud Responsibilities Shared and Collaboration S4HANA PCE.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/194920i900C0BE2D593C546/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SAP ECS RISE Enterprise Cloud Responsibilities Shared and Collaboration S4HANA PCE.png" alt="SAP ECS RISE Enterprise Cloud Responsibilities Shared and Collaboration S4HANA PCE.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;In my opinion the above picture is not detailed enough, it doesn't communicated really how much responsibility the Customer SAP Basis Team will have.

I find that more and more Non-SAP systems are calling OData API's on the S/4HANA and we need to be able to size for API calls, we need to think of a calling System as a User and the API as a Transaction and we need to understand the frequency of API calls, the complexity of the business logic behind the API call and the volume of the data being posted or gotten...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://assets.dm.ux.sap.com/TechEd/TechEd_Vegas2019/pdf/CAA303_Presentation.pdf?source=social-Global-brandteched-YOUTUBE-MarketingCampaign-Developers-SAPS4HANACloud-SAPTechEd-SAPTechEd20-spr-3368941760&amp;amp;campaigncode=CRM-YD20-SOC-SAPTECHED20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CAA303 - Sizing for SAP S/4HANA and SAP S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sizing 20.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/211418i27486E11012A5A8F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Sizing 20.png" alt="Sizing 20.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;As is this one...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/10/28f19e4a-8f7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Introduction into Post Go-Live Sizings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;as is this one...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/10/6222114a-8f7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sizing Methods and Tools&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;and this one...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/10/822c3247-927c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Expert Sizing &amp;amp;

The BTP is a technology enabler containing all kinds of capabilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Here is the SAP BTP Strategy WhitePaper for 2025 onwards&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.asset-id-d29a141c-e47d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html?pdf-asset=d29a141c-e47d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&amp;amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform: The Innovation Engine for Your SAP Applications&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;The first thing I am going to comment on, since this is a 1 Pager for SAP Technology Architects is the Technical Architecture of the BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Ok, but first, we need to include this one...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform: The Innovation Engine for Your SAP Applications - strategy 2025&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/06/d29a141c-e47d-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform: The Innovation Engine for Your SAP Applications&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;The BTP is extremely rich and flexible in how it can be set up and configured, and this can be a good thing and a bad thing, the biggest challenge is, making foundation layer mistakes which cost time and money to correct in the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;For me to try show how complex the BTP is, we will first look at SAP's Future Ready Enterprise Framework, this is an approach to modularising maturity with the BTP and leading the Customer on a journey to BTP Architecture Excellence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;You've heard of a SAP Customer Center of Excellence, there is now a concept of SAP BTP Center of Excellence, this shows how complex and rich this subject is.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;There is a beautiful publicly available presentation here&amp;nbsp;

the first few years the SAP Cloud Platform was mainly SAP Cloud Platform Integration and a lot of people slipped in to a bad habit of associating the BTP with Integration capability, we it's a lot more than that and we all need to appreciate that.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;The following document is another useful introduction to the SAP Future Ready Enterprise Framework:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://assets.dm.ux.sap.com/webinars/2021-12-31-sap-btp-customer-value-network-global/pdfs/csp_presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Presentation Title&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;The following picture is here to show us just how complex the BTP is, and let us all reflect on where our Company's maturity level is with the BTP:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BTP Maturity Assessment 1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/195741i5F58B47A0B94E665/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="BTP Maturity Assessment 1.png" alt="BTP Maturity Assessment 1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Just spend some time to study that table and think about where your Organisation's maturity level is and whether or not it would be a good investment to buy some BTP Training and Services from SAP.

style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;In my opinion of the SAP world, it's fair to say that CALM is a new(er) product, and it is a fact that it is evolving, and the capabilities are evolving according to SAP's RoadMap and Vision for CALM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Everybody needs to keep in mind, that CALM is not a 1 to 1 replacement of SolMan, and even the planned capabilities of CALM are not yet all in place, but, according to SAP they will be.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;CALM is going to be the center or our universe, we will be "doing" the whole Program/Operation from CALM, from what I hear SAP has hundreds of programmers working on CALM, the following presentation is a great way to open this section and give a view of what CALM is in 2024 and where CALM is going....&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left :

a SAP RISE Toolbox there are links to how to do a SAP CCOE ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That's a great question, and the answer is that, most companies have been running/operating SAP the same way since 3.1h, and now with RISE the whole game is changing, the Roles and Responsibilities are changing and the Segregation of Duties is changing, between who does what, SAP, Customer, and if they have one the Customer's System Integrator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And that's why, during the S/4HANA RISE Transformation, you will be best off, if you take the opportunity and redesign how you run/operate SAP, the way you have run SAP for the ECC generation will not fit to how you run SAP in the RISE generation, and on top of this, isn't it time for "The Business" and "IT/SAP" to get closer together ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This will help with setting the scene..

7] Lessons Learned&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(this section is an ongoing work in progress)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to Avoid Delays in an S/4HANA Program&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am leading with this one, as in my opinion it is the most important and the mechanisms for avoiding delays drill down in to other areas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Delays in the S/4 Programs can run into costs of millions per month, according to the cash burn rate of the Program. There are ways to avoid and reduce the chance of delays, and that's what we're going to discuss here.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Currently on my second S/4 Program and looking forward to the third one, this has given me a deep understanding of the "procedure", and the activities, and what works and what doesn't and enables reflection how to avoid problems, and the biggest problem in my opinion is DELAYS to the Program. The S/4 Program is huge, and it is very expensive, and has a hugely expensive monthly burn rate, and delays in the S/4 Program have at least two painful impacts, the first one is the monthly extended cash burn rate, and the second is the delaying of other Programs and Projects which are dependent on the on time success of the S/4 Program and it's Releases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In my experience, Delays will become visible in SIT and UAT, this is where things will happen which will result in Delays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That does not mean that SIT and UAT are the cause of the Delays, it means the gaps / weaknesses become exposed during SIT and UAT, which actually is the purpose of SIT and UAT.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The problem is that in SIT and UAT, I see the same pattern, Defects and even Design Changes are being exposed which could have, and should have become visible earlier, which means the prior phases were not executed properly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The problem is, an S/4 Program is not a SAP Migration or Upgrade or Transformation in the classical sense, it is a Data Transformation, a Process Transformation, a Technical Basis Transformation, an Integration Transformation, a User Experience Transformation, an Operations Transformation, a User Interface Transformation, a Security Transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Invest in Training, Education, and

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-947634015"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A Glimpse into the History of Custom SAP Systems&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Consider the transport history of a small to medium-sized enterprise (SME). This record captures essential moments in the system's life - when transports occurred, who approved them, and which objects were moved into production. Such insights provide a clear picture of how the system has developed over time.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Example of ERP system workbench transport history (SME customer)" style="width: 653px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/202858i24FF964EC96E53BA/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="WorkbenchTH.png" alt="Example of ERP system workbench transport history (SME customer)" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Example of ERP system workbench transport history (SME customer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Example of ERP system customizing transport history (same SME customer)" style="width: 653px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/202859i01C306A9F29D46BA/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="CustomizingTH.png" alt="Example of ERP system customizing transport history (same SME customer)" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Example of ERP system customizing transport history (same SME customer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The volume of transported objects varies with company size. Larger enterprises often show a higher density of daily transports, reflecting more extensive system usage:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Another customer example of an SAP ECC workbench transport history.  The blue hatched area represents the density of the daily transports as additional information" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/202871i9C6A87D434E83A19/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="0006_02_PLOT__transp_history_workbench.png" alt="Another customer example of an SAP ECC workbench transport history.

The blue hatched area represents the density of the daily transports as additional information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It becomes more interesting when we take the transport history of a software package (DEVLASS) as an example for this customer and plot the individual developers and their activities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="An example software package (DEVLASS) workbench transport history of this customer" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/202884i7F5426832109DBB1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="devclass_workbench_history.png" alt="An example software package (DEVLASS) workbench transport history of this customer" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;An example software package (DEVLASS) workbench transport history of this customer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Each horizontal line represents the activity of a user  within the software package (DEVLASS).

The names of the users are grayed out for privacy reasons)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When looking at the activities based on the workbench transport history and considering the time-limited activities of users along with their simultaneous or staggered actions, we can discuss the development history and the developers involved. This makes for a good conversation starter with the relevant development manager, system administrator, or subject matter expert: "Which developer is the most experienced?", "Was knowledge able to be passed on between developers?", "Can I identify development initiatives?", "These two developers are our best procurement process experts!"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The way this information is presented is well-suited for storytelling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-751120510"&gt;Storytelling and Reconstructed History&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Storytelling transforms complex technical processes into relatable narratives. Instead of drowning stakeholders in dry details, the narrative approach fosters collaboration between IT teams and business stakeholders. When technical information is presented as a story, IT professionals can communicate their ideas more effectively, leading to richer discussions about system features and enhancements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, storytelling comes with its challenges. One risk is exaggeration or misrepresentation; presenting hypothetical scenarios as facts can create misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations. To maintain trust, it’s crucial that stories are grounded in real data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-554607005"&gt;Understanding the Evolution of Custom SAP Systems for Better Transformation&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every custom SAP system tells a story shaped by organizational decisions throughout its development. This narrative encompasses not just technical specifications but also the experiences of those involved. Analyzing this evolution helps organizations make informed decisions about their software strategies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Having spent years in Custom Development and Innovative Business Solutions (IBSO), I’ve seen firsthand how important it is to examine software evolution. The method of Software Evolution Analysis arose from the need for quick communication with clients about custom systems. This analysis captures the essence of a system's history, showing how past choices influence current functions and future developments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In future blog posts, I will go deeper into this topic, sharing examples and insights that demonstrate how storytelling can clarify the complexities of custom SAP systems. Additionally, I will showcase analyses and modeling techniques that further enhance our understanding of these systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;References&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Change and Transport System (CTS):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/tools/software-logistics-tools/change-and-transport-system.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://support.sap.com/en/tools/software-logistics-tools/change-and-transport-system.html&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lehman, M.

This tool offers many features that organizations have been anticipating, including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Registering and discovering SAP applications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Listing discovered SAP applications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Listing configurations of discovered SAP applications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integration with AWS Backup&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this article, we will introduce the basics of ssm-sap and explore how to use it to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Discover SAP systems&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Monitor SAP systems&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Perform basic operations such as starting and stopping SAP systems&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Natively, ssm-sap is CLI-based. To visualize the operations in real time, we will use powerful web based visualization tool: Streamlit. In a sequel to this blog, we plan to provide all the codes used, and discuss more advanced topics such as performing system refreshes and auto-scaling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here we will explore the integration of AWS Systems Manager for SAP (SSM-SAP) with Streamlit to create a robust and user-friendly solution for managing SAP systems. By leveraging SSM-SAP's capabilities for discovery, automation, and monitoring, combined with Streamlit's interactive web application framework, we propose a solution that automates key tasks such as system discovery, visualization of system health, and execution of essential operations like starting and stopping SAP instances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The proposed solution offers significant benefits, including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;* Simplified System Management: Streamlined processes for discovering and managing SAP systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;* Enhanced Visibility: Real-time monitoring of system health.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;* Automated Operations: Automated execution of common tasks, reducing manual effort and potential errors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;* User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive web interface for easy interaction and control.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By combining the power of SSM-SAP and Streamlit, we aim to empower SAP administrators to efficiently manage their SAP environments and improve overall system reliability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I. Introduction to ssm-sap&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AWS Systems Manager for SAP (ssm-sap)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;is a welcome addition to SAP management after Launch Wizard for SAP and AWS backup for HANA. It also integrates well with the other SAP facilities. If we provision SAP systems via Launch Wizard, ssm-sap registration and AWS backup are automatically configured during the process, as seen here from Launch Wizard screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="HongzhuQiao_0-1735516118986.png" style="width: 769px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/205819i8F54BD2C5345D1A6/image-dimensions/769x515?v=v2" width="769" height="515" role="button" title="HongzhuQiao_0-1735516118986.png" alt="HongzhuQiao_0-1735516118986.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In case that SAP servers are provisioned elsewhere, it is possible to register manually.

component.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ACTIVATED - this status has been deprecated.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;STARTING - the component is in the process of being started.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;STOPPED - the component is not running.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;STOPPING - the component is in the process of being stopped.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;RUNNING - the component is running.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;RUNNING_WITH_ERROR - one or more child component(s) of the parent component is not running.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;UNDEFINED - AWS Systems Manager for SAP cannot provide the component status based on the discovered information. Verify your SAP application.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Through ssm-sap, starting and stopping SAP become as easy as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; aws ssm-sap start-application ...&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; aws ssm-sap stop-application ...&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As seen, ssm-sap does provide comprehensive tools to discover, monitor and operate SAP systems. Nevertheless, when there are tens or hundreds of systems, it could become a daunting task to manage and monitor all by command lines. That is where visualization tool streamlit comes to the rescue.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;II. Introduction to streamlit&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share amazing custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In just a few minutes, you can build and deploy powerful data-driven applications. Streamlit is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to transform data scripts into interactive web applications without requiring extensive web development knowledge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Features,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ease of Use&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Streamlit allows you to create web apps with pure Python. No need for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Interactive Widgets&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Add interactive widgets like sliders, buttons, and text inputs with minimal code.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Real-Time Updates&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Streamlit apps update in real-time as users interact with widgets, providing immediate feedback.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Visualization&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Integrate with popular data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, and Altair.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deployment&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Easily deploy your Streamlit apps to the web using Streamlit Sharing, Docker, or cloud services like AWS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please check &lt;A href="https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;to start with streamlit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is a simple example with intro.py,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;import streamlit as st&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;import pandas as pd&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;chart_data = pd.DataFrame(&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;np.random.randn(20, 3),&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;st.line_chart(chart_data)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once kicking off "streamlit run intro.py", we have this chart,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="HongzhuQiao_0-1735561652019.png" style="width: 758px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206156i75846E980CC91C1E/image-dimensions/758x403?v=v2" width="758" height="403" role="button" title="HongzhuQiao_0-1735561652019.png" alt="HongzhuQiao_0-1735561652019.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is a whole gallery of streamlit applications in :&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://streamlit.io/gallery" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://streamlit.io/gallery&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;III. Use streamlit to monitor and perform operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By utilizing Streamlit, you can build an intuitive and interactive dashboard to monitor and operate SAP systems. This dashboard can call ssm-sap&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;to perform various management tasks, providing a seamless and user-friendly interface for SAP administrators.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Initially all applications are in stopped states:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="HongzhuQiao_0-1735558112517.png" style="width: 785px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206143iD655159063142958/image-dimensions/785x401?v=v2" width="785" height="401" role="button" title="HongzhuQiao_0-1735558112517.png" alt="HongzhuQiao_0-1735558112517.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We click button Start All&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="HongzhuQiao_0-1735562226964.png" style="width: 765px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206161iE0BE7FE19A626EF2/image-dimensions/765x306?v=v2" width="765" height="306" role="button" title="HongzhuQiao_0-1735562226964.png" alt="HongzhuQiao_0-1735562226964.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In a few minutes, we will see HANA starts first.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="HongzhuQiao_2-1735558362756.png" style="width: 765px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206146iC9CAE9ED934D9D65/image-dimensions/765x377?v=v2" width="765" height="377" role="button" title="HongzhuQiao_2-1735558362756.png" alt="HongzhuQiao_2-1735558362756.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, all starts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="HongzhuQiao_3-1735558445521.png" style="width: 766px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206148i42FA2E19D61EA5B7/image-dimensions/766x379?v=v2" width="766" height="379" role="button" title="HongzhuQiao_3-1735558445521.png" alt="HongzhuQiao_3-1735558445521.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By combining AWS Systems Manager (SSM) with Streamlit, one can create a powerful, cost-effective solution for monitoring and managing SAP environments. This setup leverages AWS’s robust management capabilities and Streamlit’s flexible visualization tools to provide a comprehensive solution that can save time and reduce costs associated with SAP system maintenance (patching and upgrade etc) and operations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In SAP, effective document management is essential for seamless business operations. Transaction code NACE serves as a critical tool for configuring and managing output determination, enabling organizations to generate and distribute documents such as invoices, purchase orders, and delivery notes. This blog provides a comprehensive overview of NACE and its applications.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In SAP, the output management process plays a crucial role in generating and distributing business documents like invoices, purchase orders, and delivery notes. One of the primary tools used for configuring these outputs is the NACE transaction code. This blog will guide you through the process of creating and customizing an output type in SAP using NACE.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;NACE T-code &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;NACE is a transaction code in SAP ABAP used for&amp;nbsp;output determination. It helps in configuring and managing the output types for various documents like purchase orders, sales orders, delivery notes, and billing documents. Here's a brief overview of its components:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Application:&lt;SPAN&gt; Defines the type of document (e.g., EF for purchase orders, V1 for sales documents).&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Output Types:&lt;SPAN&gt; Specifies the format and medium of the output (e.g., print, email, fax).&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Processing Routines: Links the output type to the driver program and the form (e.g., SAP script or Smart form) used for generating the output.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Using NACE, you can dynamically determine the output based on various conditions, making it a flexible tool for managing document outputs in SAP.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Features of NACE&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Centralized Configuration: Simplifies the setup and management of output determination for different business processes.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Support for Multiple Application Areas: Covers diverse areas such as sales (V1), purchasing (EF), and inventory management (ML).&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customizable Output Types: Allows the creation and configuration of custom output types tailored to business needs.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integration with Forms: Supports integration with SAP script, Smart Forms, and Adobe Forms for document formatting.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Output Processing – SAP Output Message with SAP NACE&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This article explains how to create a new SAP Output Message using the NACE T-code. It provides a step-by-step tutorial covering all the necessary customizations to set up a fully functional output message type from scratch.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create a new sap output message Type&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1: Call NACE T-code and Go to&amp;nbsp;Output Types&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Launch the SAP Transaction Code&amp;nbsp;NACE&amp;nbsp;for Conditions for Output Control.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;First let’s select the Output Types as following and The Application (for Sales, Application is V1) &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shyam4U_0-1735884710170.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/207071iE51CCF1DA918D4F6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shyam4U_0-1735884710170.jpeg" alt="Shyam4U_0-1735884710170.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2: Change display mode to edit mode then Create New entry&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shyam4U_1-1735884710172.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/207072i48D74859BAE3AD48/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shyam4U_1-1735884710172.jpeg" alt="Shyam4U_1-1735884710172.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3: Fill ID of SAP Output Message Type, description and access type&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shyam4U_2-1735884710174.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/207073iF4B562AF69BCAB51/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shyam4U_2-1735884710174.jpeg" alt="Shyam4U_2-1735884710174.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create the output type with a custom name starting with "Z."&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4: Set NACE Output Type Dispatch Time for? sap output message&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can process a message immediately by updating the application document or you can process it at a later time. For later processing you must use the report program&amp;nbsp;RSNAST00? or a corresponding application function.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shyam4U_0-1735885850817.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/207085iC649E69094F7C22C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shyam4U_0-1735885850817.jpeg" alt="Shyam4U_0-1735885850817.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Send with periodically scheduled job:&lt;SPAN&gt; The message is processed through report program RSNAST00. This report program can be scheduled periodically or started manually&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Send with job, with additional time specification:&lt;SPAN&gt; As in time 1, but the message contains an earliest processing date and a requested processing time. The message is ignored by report program RSNAST00 before the requested date.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Send with application own transaction:&lt;SPAN&gt; The message is selected and processed by application specific programs. Processing can take place online or in the background&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Send immediately (when saving the application): The message is processed when the application document is saved. No further processing of the message is necessary.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5: Set Message Transmission Medium Specifies how the output will be produced.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can specify, for example, that the output is printed or that it is produced and sent by other means, such as fax, electronic mail, or electronic data interchange (EDI/ IDoc). ￼&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shyam4U_0-1735886165581.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/207086i0D0CF052BE3E1324/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shyam4U_0-1735886165581.jpeg" alt="Shyam4U_0-1735886165581.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Step &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;6:&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Set Partner Function a sample list of used function &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;partner&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; in Output Type&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shyam4U_0-1735887628938.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/207099i5E8E8D7EAE057054/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shyam4U_0-1735887628938.jpeg" alt="Shyam4U_0-1735887628938.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Sold-To Party&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Bill-to Party&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SH&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Ship-To Party&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;PY&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Payer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;LS&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Logical System?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Etc.......&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Step &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;7:&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Set Processing routines&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;For each Transmission Medium, a processing routine must be configured. For this sample, the Output Type triggers an IDoc with the program&amp;nbsp;RSNASTED&amp;nbsp;within the routine&amp;nbsp;EDI_PROCESSING. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shyam4U_0-1735888962513.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/207110iCFC3E78C6D27A1BD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shyam4U_0-1735888962513.jpeg" alt="Shyam4U_0-1735888962513.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can leave all the rest of tabs blank.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When Saving, SAP will ask you for customization request.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear Guru's,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Happy New Year Everyone. Wishing Everyone a Healthy and Happy Life.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I have always faced issues or in understanding the Netweaver and EHP Versions while doing Upgrades or Netweaver Stack Upgrades.&lt;BR /&gt;Here I wanted to give a short information with respect to Netweaver Versions for understanding purpose which might help someone in getting a clear picture. Hope it Helps.&lt;BR /&gt;ECC --&amp;gt; Enterprise Core Component starts with ECC 6.0, ECC 6.0 EHP1 till ECC 6.0 EHP8.&lt;BR /&gt;NW --&amp;gt; Netweaver starts with Netweaver 7.0 till Netweaver 7.52.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Below are few information On ECC and Netweaver Versions.&lt;BR /&gt;ECC Versions with EHP8 Details:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="453px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="57px"&gt;S.No&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="57px"&gt;Year Released&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="57px"&gt;ECC Versions&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="30px"&gt;1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="30px"&gt;2016&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="30px"&gt;ECC 6 EHP8&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="30px"&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="30px"&gt;2013&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="30px"&gt;ECC 6 EHP7&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="30px"&gt;3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="30px"&gt;2011&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="30px"&gt;ECC 6 EHP6&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="30px"&gt;4&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="30px"&gt;2010&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="30px"&gt;ECC 6 EHP5&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="30px"&gt;5&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="30px"&gt;2008&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="30px"&gt;ECC 6 EHP4&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="30px"&gt;6&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="30px"&gt;2007&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="30px"&gt;ECC 6 EHP3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="30px"&gt;7&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="30px"&gt;2007&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="30px"&gt;ECC 6 EHP2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="30px"&gt;8&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="30px"&gt;2006&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="30px"&gt;ECC 6 EHP1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="63.9489px" height="25px"&gt;9&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="97.9261px" height="25px"&gt;2005&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="290.511px" height="25px"&gt;ECC 6.0&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Netweaver Versions:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="618px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="61.9508px" height="57px"&gt;S.No&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="96.9508px" height="57px"&gt;Year Released&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="138.883px" height="57px"&gt;Netweaver Versions&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="319.602px" height="57px"&gt;Comments&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="61.9508px" height="30px"&gt;1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="96.9508px" height="30px"&gt;2015&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="138.883px" height="30px"&gt;7.5 ==&amp;gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introduction: -&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;SAP’s Restful ABAP Programming Model (RAP), creating and managing complex transactional applications has become simpler and more structured. One of the powerful capabilities of RAP is Deep Insert, which allows you to handle hierarchical data structures (like headers and items) in a single API call. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios such as creating a Header item with multiple line items or managing a parent-child relationship in one transaction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we will explore Deep Insert in RAP.&amp;nbsp; We will walk through creating a RAP-based application with a deep insert to handle hierarchical data in a single request.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Steps to create the deep insert: -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1: -&lt;/STRONG&gt;Create Two Database table (One header and second item): -&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A)- Header table.&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Inside header table it must to use the data element for the field which is going to use in foreign key relationship)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@EndUserText.label : 'Header table'

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is SGEN?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(SGEN Stand for SAP Generation Tool)&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a serviceability which is &amp;nbsp;used in SAP to regenerate or upgrade the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Kernel&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Data Dictionary&lt;/STRONG&gt; objects in the system. It is run after some certain activities, such as an upgrade, system refresh, or transport of new objects to ensure that all necessary components are correctly generated and available for use in the system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why We Run SGEN:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are the some primary reasons for running the SGEN transaction in SAP:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Regenerate Repository Objects&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When we perform system changes like upgrades, kernel updates, or transport requests that involve new or modified programs and objects (like ABAP programs, function modules, or Data Dictionary objects), SGEN is used to regenerate and optimize these objects.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Speed Up the System Performance&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Running SGEN precompiles the all ABAP objects and loads them into the shared memory, improving runtime performance. It essentially optimizes the load times of various programs and helps in reducing runtime errors by ensuring that all necessary components are generated.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System Refresh&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;After performing a system copy or refresh, the system might not have all the required objects in a usable state, so running SGEN regenerates those objects to ensure they are ready for use in the new environment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Incomplete Objects&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sometimes, after transporting or performing system activities, some objects might not be fully available or need to be re-generated due to discrepancies. Running SGEN will correct these issues and make sure that everything is generated properly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Update Kernel Files and Load Programs&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SGEN helps to ensure that all kernel files (like program source code or executables) are up-to-date and optimized, which can also include various libraries or specific functions required by the SAP system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;When to Run SGEN:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;After a System Upgrade or Kernel Update&lt;/STRONG&gt;: To regenerate kernel files, programs, and objects, ensuring that all new updates are correctly applied.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;After a Transport Import&lt;/STRONG&gt;: To regenerate objects and precompile them after transports, especially those that involve new or updated ABAP programs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;After a System Refresh or Copy&lt;/STRONG&gt;: When moving the system to a new environment, SGEN will ensure that all objects are in a consistent and usable state.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;After Large-Scale Modifications&lt;/STRONG&gt;: If there are major changes to the system, such as custom developments, SGEN ensures that these are appropriately regenerated.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to Run S-Gen:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can run the SGEN tool by using transaction SGEN in the SAP GUI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note:- It runs&lt;STRONG&gt; From SAP*/DDIC user (SID did not have authorization).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Log in to SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt; and go to the SGEN transaction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="mohityadav3_0-1738906292602.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img

as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Regeneration of all repository objects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Regeneration for specific objects or areas&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="mohityadav3_1-1738906292613.png" style="width:

process&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The tool will then process the selected objects and regenerate or optimize them, depending on the settings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span

Considerations:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System Performance&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Running SGEN can be resource-intensive, so it is best done during off-peak hours to minimize performance impacts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Time Consumption&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Depending on the size of the system and the number of objects to regenerate, this process may take a significant amount of time, so planning for an appropriate window is important.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitoring&lt;/STRONG&gt;: You can monitor the progress of the SGEN job through transaction SM37 (for job monitoring) to ensure that it completes without issues.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In summary, SGEN is an important tool in SAP used to regenerate and optimize various components after system changes to ensure everything is functioning smoothly and efficiently.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope you enjoyed reading.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Conclusion-&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We discussed

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1831017622"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A purchase requisition is an internal document used in an organization to request the procurement of goods or services. In SAP, efficient management of purchase requisitions is crucial for smooth procurement operations. This blog will provide a clear guide on releasing PR documents from HOLD or PARK status using BAPIs and releasing the document for further processing.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1634504117"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Understanding Parked and Hold Documents in SAP:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;First, let's understand the PARK and HOLD options in SAP. These functionalities are essential for managing purchasing documents, allowing users to save them temporarily for later processing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hold: &lt;/STRONG&gt;If the document has incorrect or incomplete data and you want to save it temporarily to process later, use the Hold option.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Park: &lt;/STRONG&gt;If the document has complete and correct data but needs further workflow approvals or budget checks, use the Park functionality.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1437990612"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Activating Hold and Park options:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To activate the PARK and HOLD options in transactions ME51N, ME52N, and ME53N, follow these two steps:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Activate Business Functionality&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Go to T-Code SPRO.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Click on Activate Business Functions&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Activate Business Functionality.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/228250i49A6F0A5595B665A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Activate Business Functionality.jpg" alt="Activate Business Functionality.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Expand the folder Enterprise_Business_Functions and activate the functionality &lt;STRONG&gt;LOG_MM_CI_3&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Park &amp;amp; Hold - Business Functionality .jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/228249i1913B2DF4DD7F4BF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Park &amp;amp; Hold - Business Functionality .jpg" alt="Park &amp;amp; Hold - Business Functionality .jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;2.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The SAP Host Agent (Version 720 with patch level 45 and higher) provides an automatic upgrade feature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1473974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1473974 - Using the SAP Host Agent Auto Upgrade Feature - SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step-1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Maintain the below parameters in host profile and restart the Host-agent&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;DIR_NEW=&amp;lt;path to a directory&amp;gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;The directory location containing the new extracted SAP Host Agent version can be changed using this profile value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;hostexec/autoupgrade_delay=&amp;lt;minutes&amp;gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;By default, SAP Host Agent performs the check on DIR_NEW five minutes after SAP Host Agent start and then periodically every 60 minutes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This behavior can be changed using the profile value hostexec/autoupgrade_delay in the SAP Host Agent profile host_profile.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The minimum value can be 1 minute, the maximum value can be ~49 days.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, the initial wait time (5 minutes by default) will not exceed 5 minutes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Host_1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231057i5CF88A00E0741C91/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Host_1.jpg" alt="Host_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;For example&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;DIR_NEW = C:\temp\SAPHOSTAGENT&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;hostexec/autoupgrade_delay = 60&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Host_2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231060i888AC9F77F1C7A4D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Host_2.jpg" alt="Host_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Restart the Hostagent: saphostexec –restart&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Host_3.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231063i503765E129D2849D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Host_3.jpg" alt="Host_3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step-2:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create an empty file “.upgrading” in the location &lt;STRONG&gt;C:\temp\SAPHOSTAGENT&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To avoid that SAP Host Agent starts the upgrade procedure during the extraction of the .SAR (with the consequence that only partially the new version of SAP Host Agent will be used for an upgrade) you should create an empty file called &lt;STRONG&gt;.upgrading &lt;/STRONG&gt;in the directory &lt;EM&gt;DIR_NEW&lt;/EM&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You may need to manually add your SAP systems to the Maintenance Planner in a number of different scenarios. For instance, if your Solman isn't working properly or if high security settings prohibit this. To compute your update stacks for the systems and subsequently patch the systems, you require the most recent system data in the Maintenance Planner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;For ABAP Based Systems:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step-1: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Generate the Stack XML file by using SPAM T-code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MP_1.jpg" style="width: 850px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231069i6206E9C5B9F3B187/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MP_1.jpg" alt="MP_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MP_2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231071iADB65D2A752B8C8F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MP_2.jpg" alt="MP_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step-2:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Support Portal Home&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;–&amp;gt;Maintenance&amp;nbsp;–&amp;gt; Maintenance Planner –&amp;gt; Access Maintenance Planner –&amp;gt;Explore Systems –&amp;gt; Add system &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MP_3.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231073i49E2122B17E0AC7C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MP_3.jpg" alt="MP_3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Double click on the Explore Systems&amp;nbsp;tile&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MP_4.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231078iAAA20CA83E59AE6C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MP_4.jpg" alt="MP_4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Choose&amp;nbsp;Add System&amp;nbsp;button placed on the top right-hand corner of the view.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An&amp;nbsp;Add System&amp;nbsp;dialog box is displayed with information about adding systems using the automated data replication of SAP Solution Manager.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MP_5.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231079i7C1C71975EFE7DAA/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MP_5.jpg" alt="MP_5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Read the information and provide your confirmation by selecting the&amp;nbsp;I Accept.&amp;nbsp;checkbox and choose&amp;nbsp;Next.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MP_6.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231084iA8385B6EAB08FFB4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MP_6.jpg" alt="MP_6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Upload the system information XML of your choice in the following ways:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Choose the&amp;nbsp;Browse…&amp;nbsp;button to upload any system information XML.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can proceed further once the system successfully validates the selected system information XML.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MP_7.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231087iC3AF1F558DE2F343/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MP_7.jpg" alt="MP_7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MP_8.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231090iD6B7AA0303E0D114/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MP_8.jpg" alt="MP_8.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MP_9.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/231091i65C60A1DF8588613/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MP_9.jpg" alt="MP_9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Choose&amp;nbsp;Next.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello, BASIS Team.&lt;BR /&gt;In this article, I'd like to discuss the SPS update procedure from the scratch for ABAP systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To obtain approval to carry out the activity, we must first prepare the technical plan document.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Plan_1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/239629iADA08BFE35AACD54/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Plan_1.jpg" alt="Plan_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Plan_2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/240756i49123A9805B07D5E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Plan_2.jpg" alt="Plan_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pre-requisites:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1.

For database types of ASE: sapsa, sapsso, and sa users' credentials.&lt;BR /&gt;HANA: system user credentials.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Process:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1.Create a

the media files to the server, ensuring suitable permissions and ownership.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Disk space in the file system for the SUM directory, the download directory, and directory DIR_TRANS.&lt;BR /&gt;The space required depends on the product you are updating.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP suggested at least 40 GB of free space for both the SUM and download directories, as well as 20 GB for the DIR_TRANS directory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Software Update Manager calculates the database's space requirements. The required amount of free space ranges from 50 to 200 GB.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our case we placed at &lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;lt;Drive&amp;gt;:usr\sap\SID\Downloads&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dow_1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/240446i096D2CA2B782889D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Dow_1.jpg" alt="Dow_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Move the sum.sar file from downloads to &lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;lt;Drive&amp;gt;:usr\sap\SID&lt;/STRONG&gt; and extract the sum.sar file with sapcar&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After successful extraction, a new directory will be created under the name SUM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dow_2.jpg" style="width: 832px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/240447i9263842AF122627F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Dow_2.jpg" alt="Dow_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dow_3.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/240448i95CC2D13AFCC1A20/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Dow_3.jpg" alt="Dow_3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. Launch the SUM tool with the following command.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dow_4.jpg" style="width: 978px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/240450i303089E1CEF19734/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Dow_4.jpg" alt="Dow_4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Paste the above URL in any web browser.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;https://&amp;lt;fully qualified hostname&amp;gt;:1129/lmsl/sumabap/&amp;lt;SID&amp;gt;/slui&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Enter the sidadm user credentials and click on the sign in button.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If there is an issue with launching the SUM URL.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It might be attributed primarily to the SAP host agent. (Faulty installation, incorrect permissions, etc.). Dev_saphostexec and sapstartsrv.log (found in the /work directory) are crucial logs for resolving common UI issues on the SAP host agent side.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If no apparent problem is observed in these logs, try increasing their trace level by following.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Open the SAP Host Agent profile ( host_profile ) which is located in the exe directory of the SAP Host Agent (/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/ or C:\Program Files\SAP\hostctrl\exe\).&lt;BR /&gt;Add or modify the required values, for example:&lt;BR /&gt;hostexec/trace = 3&lt;BR /&gt;service/trace = 3&lt;BR /&gt;Restart SAP Host Agent by executing saphostexec -restart.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SPS_4.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/235085i93B3DB6F0E1F9BA6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SPS_4.jpg" alt="SPS_4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Hostagent_1.jpg" style="width: 943px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/240757i5923A94DF3CD2ACC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Hostagent_1.jpg" alt="Hostagent_1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Hostagent_2.jpg" style="width: 937px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/240758iC96B1D57C866DF38/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Hostagent_2.jpg" alt="Hostagent_2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resolution can be found from the below KBA's&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2475146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2475146 - SUM : logon via SAP Host Agent is failing "Unable to locate the requested resource" or "&amp;lt;hostname&amp;gt;\&amp;lt;sidadm&amp;gt; is not authorized to process the operation ExecuteOperation" - SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Software Update Manager internally calls the SAPup executable.

It affects all job-run phases, including long runtime ones such as DBCLONE (in update situations), ACT_UPG and PARDIST in uptime, and XPRAs in downtime.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The DBCLONE phase has a technical restriction of 10 parallel processes at most, therefore increasing the number would not assist.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SQL Processes (Uptime &amp;amp; Downtime):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This option specifies the number of parallel SQL statements to be executed on the database at the same time. This setting is especially beneficial for the DDL (data definition language) phases, such as MVNTAB and PARCONV, where commands like "create table," "alter table," "create index," and others are executed. This parameter is also used by the phases that construct aliases/synonyms for the shadow system (SCEXEC_GRANT + SCEXEC_ALIAS), albeit to a lesser extent. The recommended value is the total number of physical CPUs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;R3trans Processes (Uptime &amp;amp; Downtime):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This parameter is used for tp and R3trans transport tools in parallel during the phases where support packages are imported (DDIC_UPG, SHADOW_IMPORT*, and TABIM_UPG).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recommended value is 1 to 2 times the CPU, with a maximum of 50 CPUs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If your CPU is multi-core, the SAP system will treat it as a physical, available CPU.&lt;BR /&gt;For example, if you have four quad-core CPUs, the SAP system will recognize them as sixteen CPUs in ST06. In this situation, you can put '16' for both the UPTIME and DOWNTIME R3TRANS PROCESSES fields (note that standard transport requests import may still occur during uptime, and they share the same tp/R3trans resources). So, avoid importing requests during upgrades.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;R3load Processes (Uptime &amp;amp; Downtime):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This parameter guides the upgrade tool how many R3load processes will be executed during phases EU_IMPORT* (in system releases upgrade) and DMO (data migration option) scenarios to transfer data from the old database to the new HANA one. Because R3load uses modest CPU processing, you can safely specify a large value for this parameter: 3 to 5 times the number of CPUs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select the radio button &lt;STRONG&gt;Automated batch job distribution&lt;/STRONG&gt; (If you have multiple instances and batch job load scheduling is scheduled)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SPS_17.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/235098iFC6118BB4BE3A1AD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SPS_17.jpg" alt="SPS_17.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SPS_18.jpg" style="width: 885px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/235099i9D26ED0F2DD37EE3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SPS_18.jpg" alt="SPS_18.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SPS_19.jpg" style="width: 714px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/235100i061DBDE742730457/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SPS_19.jpg" alt="SPS_19.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SPS_20.jpg" style="width: 721px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/235101i1AFE9CAE880B69BC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SPS_20.jpg" alt="SPS_20.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our case, select the radio button &lt;STRONG&gt;HOSTNAME_SID_&amp;lt;nn&amp;gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Uncheck the Start ABAP Load Generation During Update checkbox and then click the Next button.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="SAR_4.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/235371i01A19C81CD86CACE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SAR_4.jpg" alt="SAR_4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Load Generator (SGEN) is a transaction that compiles ABAP repository objects that are newly supplied into the system, either through an installation or an upgrade/support package import. The term "Load" refers to an ABAP runtime object used in ABAP settings.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The ABAP objects are stored on their source code in table &lt;STRONG&gt;REPOSRC&lt;/STRONG&gt; and on their runtime state in table &lt;STRONG&gt;REPOLOAD.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you selected the Advanced pre-configuration mode in SUM, you would get the following prompt&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Choose an execution strategy for transaction SGEN.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Do not start ABAP load generation during the update&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you plan to apply a high number of relevant changes to your system in the form of SPS updates or upgrades. We recommend that you generate the ABAP loads manually at end of post-processing phase.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Generate ABAP loads on shadow system during uptime.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this option, the Software Update Manager uses the maximum number of processes entered below to generate the loads in the shadow instance during the uptime in the update phase SUBMOD_SHD2_RUN/RUN_RSGEN.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Usually, the shadow SGEN prolongs the uptime part of the update procedure or several hours. If you run into unexpected time issues with your update schedule and you want to save the SGEN time, you can abort a running shadow SGEN by executing the report RSUPG_SGEN_ABORT_SHADOW in the shadow system.

The Software Update Manager initiates background processes to copy the necessary tables for the shadow system's operation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Depending on your system and your hardware, this operation can take several hours. These background jobs are executed on the background server that is configured with the BATCH HOST parameter. The number of jobs is determined by the parameter MAX BATCH PROCESSES. It cannot be higher than nine or the number of background processes configured on the background server.&lt;BR /&gt;Each table is copied with a single INSERT statement. Therefore, the administrator has to take care that the undo-logs can grow accordingly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each cloning job writes a log file called DBCLONE&amp;lt;NUMBER&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;SID&amp;gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;At the end of the phase, all errors found in these log files are collected in the DBCLONE.ELG file.&lt;BR /&gt;The information in the DBCLONE.ELG file is rather sparse.

You can manually start or&lt;BR /&gt;stop the shadow instance using the commands SAPup startshd or SAPup stopshd.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;To lock or unlock the shadow instance, use the commands SAPup lockshd or SAPup unlockshd.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;To perform SPDD modifications, proceed as follows:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. The Software Update Manager prompts you to confirm that you want to perform a modification adjustment.&lt;BR /&gt;2. Add an entry for the shadow instance to the SAP Logon. For the server and system ID, use the values from the original system&lt;BR /&gt;For the instance number, use the value you specified in the preparation units for the shadow instance. The default value is the instance number of the original system plus one.&lt;BR /&gt;Since the original system is still running if you use the scenario strategy Standard or Downtime-optimized, you can also log on to the shadow instance in transaction SM59 with the RFC connection&lt;STRONG&gt; SAP_UPGRADE_SHADOW_SYSTEM.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shadow_RFC.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/240759i4F41114A9F126108/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shadow_RFC.jpg" alt="Shadow_RFC.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Log into the shadow instance as user DDIC with the DDIC password of the original system.&lt;BR /&gt;Only the users DDIC and SAP* exist in the shadow instance.&lt;BR /&gt;4. To set the system change option, call transaction SE06. Perform the following actions&lt;BR /&gt;Set the global setting to Modifiable.&lt;BR /&gt;Set the change option for the software components to Modifiable or Restricted modifiable.&lt;BR /&gt;Set the SAP namespace to Modifiable.&lt;BR /&gt;5. Call transaction SU01 to create one or more users to perform the modification adjustment. The new users exist only on the shadow instance and are not copied to the original system.&lt;BR /&gt;Release upgrade only: Copy the user DDIC of client 000. SPS update: Since all users of client 000 are copied in the DBCLONE phase to the shadow instance, any of them can be used for the modification adjustment.&lt;BR /&gt;6. Log into the shadow instance with one of the new users. Modification adjustment of ABAP Dictionary objects has to be performed in client 000.&lt;BR /&gt;7.

While some BEx components (BEx Query Designer, BEx WAD) will continue in maintenance mode until 2027 or 2030, the Excel-dependent tools face a &lt;STRONG&gt;hard stop&lt;/STRONG&gt;, leaving many customers exposed if no action is taken.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While many organizations are already moving forward with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Datasphere adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt; or planning their &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BW/4HANA conversion&lt;/STRONG&gt;, those still operating on &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BW 7.x&lt;/STRONG&gt; must urgently assess their current &lt;STRONG&gt;BEx tool usage&lt;/STRONG&gt; to avoid disruptions and ensure long-term supportability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this article, we break down:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What BEx tools are affected and when&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to check if your system still relies on BEx Tools approaching end of support&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Available replacements like SAP Analysis for Office and SAP Analytics Cloud&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP's mass conversion tools and services to ease your transition&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For answers to the most frequently asked questions (FAQ) about the BEx tools sunset, check out the dedicated FAQ:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sunset-of-bex-tools-frequently-asked-questions-and-answers-faq/ba-p/14112165" target="_new"&gt;Sunset of BEx Tools – Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (FAQ)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whether you have already started migrating or are still evaluating your next steps, this article will help you understand the risks, available options with existing BEx tools usage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1533967905"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BEx Solutions Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;SAP offers a range of BEx-related tools and components, each serving different roles in the reporting and analysis workflow. These solutions fall into two broad categories; those &lt;STRONG&gt;dependent on Microsoft Excel&lt;/STRONG&gt; and those that are &lt;STRONG&gt;web-based or standalone&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BEx tools can be classified in two broader categories:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Excel-Dependent (Impacted by both BEx sunset and Office lifecycle)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;BEx Analyzer&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;BEx Workbooks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;BEx Broadcaster&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standalone/Web-Based (Independent of Office support)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;BEx Query Designer&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;BEx Queries&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;BEx Web Application Designer&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;BEx tools that rely on Excel only work with specific versions of Microsoft Office. The last versions supported by BEx tools are Office 2016 and Office 2019. Since Microsoft's decision to stop supporting Office 2016 &amp;amp; 2019 versions by&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;October 14, 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;, this poses a hard limit on the support timelines for the excel based BEx reporting tools as well, and after that &lt;STRONG&gt;BEx tools dependent on Excel will no longer be supported too by SAP.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;BEx tools that don’t rely on Microsoft Office (i.e. BEx Query Designer, BEx Queries, BEx WAD) can still be used and supported until 2027 (standard support) or 2030 (extended support), in line with BW 7.50 maintenance timelines. These tools are now in maintenance-only mode, meaning SAP will only provide basic support for fixing issues in BW 7.5 with no new development, innovation or new features planned for these BEx tools. However, BEx Analyzer, BEx Workbooks, and BEx Broadcaster are dependent on Microsoft Office, so they can only be supported until October 14, 2025, when Microsoft stops supporting Office 2016 and 2019.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1337454400"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BEx Tools – Supportability Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Following table provides the End of Support for the BEx related products based on SAP NetWeaver or BEx End of Life timelines:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tanuj_G_0-1747680898930.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/263369i178DDFB38B9F89AF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Tanuj_G_0-1747680898930.png" alt="Tanuj_G_0-1747680898930.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key References and Support Notes for BEx Transition&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The End of support for BEx (excel based tools) is reinforced by external dependencies, such as Microsoft’s end of support for Office 2016 and 2019, which directly impacts the usability and security of BEx Analyzer and Workbooks and BEx Broadcaster.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has formally communicated the BEx sunset through multiple channels, including official SAP Notes and blogs dating back as early as 2016. The references below serve as key evidence points supporting the urgency and inevitability of moving to modern alternatives like SAP Analysis for Office (AO) or SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/end-of-support-for-office-2016-and-office-2019-818c68bc-d5e5-47e5-b52f-ddf636cf8e16#id0ebbd=office_2016_or_office_2019_at_home" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Microsoft Support link&lt;/A&gt; - Microsoft will &lt;STRONG&gt;no longer provide technical support, bug fixes, or security fixes&lt;/STRONG&gt; for Office 2016 and Office 2019 vulnerabilities which may be subsequently reported or discovered.&lt;STRONG&gt; This includes security updates which can help protect your PC from harmful viruses, spyware, and other malicious software&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Announcements for BEx sunset was announced through the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-business-explorer-maintenance-and-support-policy/ba-p/13304715" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/A&gt; -&amp;nbsp; Announced in 2016&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2609031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Note 2609031 &lt;/A&gt;- Sunset of BW Business Explorer (BEx) – Announced in 2018&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additional References:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1973324" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Note 1973324&lt;/A&gt; - BEx support for Microsoft Office 365 - Client Excel 2013 and&amp;nbsp; 2016&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3474912" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Note 3474912&lt;/A&gt; – BEx Query Designer support for BW 7.50&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3590297" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Note 3590297&lt;/A&gt; - SAP BW NetWeaver Cloud: Information about maintenance availability in private cloud editions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1995532" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Note 1995532&lt;/A&gt; - BI 7.x tools - HW\SW requirements and Compatibility of Microsoft Operating Systems and Office Products&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1140940895"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BEx Sunset Adoption Gaps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As part of SAP’s long-term strategy to modernize its business intelligence tooling landscape, the sunset of BEx (Business Explorer) tools has been formally announced, encouraging customers to transition to more advanced and supported alternatives such as SAP Analysis for Office (AO) and SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, many SAP BW 7.x customers are at varying stages of adoption readiness, and significant gaps remain in fully realizing this transition. We observed these customers in following categories:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transition Planned but BEx Still in Use&lt;/STRONG&gt;: BW 7.x customers who have &lt;STRONG&gt;already planned the transition&lt;/STRONG&gt; from BEx tools to modern alternatives such as &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Analysis for Office (AO)&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Users have been &lt;STRONG&gt;informed about the BEx sunset&lt;/STRONG&gt; through communication efforts like end-user trainings, replacement solutions and awareness sessions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Despite these efforts, &lt;STRONG&gt;end users continue to use BEx tools&lt;/STRONG&gt; (e.g., BEx Analyzer, BEx Workbooks) for their reporting activities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Unaware of BEx Sunset&lt;/STRONG&gt;: BW 7.x customers who are &lt;STRONG&gt;not aware of the &lt;/STRONG&gt;sunset of BEx tools.&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BEx continues to be the primary reporting tool&lt;/STRONG&gt; for all business use cases, as users are not informed of alternative solutions or the transition roadmap&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-944427390"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What SAP Products are impacted:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BW 7.5 or lower:&lt;/STRONG&gt; BEx Analyzer/Workbooks can be the primary reporting front-end for classic BW systems&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Embedded BW (in SAP ECC or ERP):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Even though Embedded BW is typically used for operational reporting, BEx Analyzer/Workbooks can still used in some implementations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SCM (Supply Chain Management): &lt;/STRONG&gt;SCM systems with APO or SNP modules often have their own BW instance or rely on Embedded BW&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While BEx is closely associated with SAP BW, its footprint extends into nearly every corner of the SAP ecosystem i.e. from legacy CRM and SRM systems to industry-specific solutions like IS-U and IS-Retail. Any system with a BW component or an integration to BW for analytics could potentially be generating BEx usage worth monitoring.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-747913885"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to identify the impact in SAP BW system:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are few potential options to check it in the system or EWA if BEx Analyzer or BEx Broadcaster is still used in the SAP BW system:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-551400380"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Option 1: &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP EarlyWatch Alert (EWA) report&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a &lt;STRONG&gt;proactive monitoring tool&lt;/STRONG&gt; provided by SAP that delivers a &lt;STRONG&gt;comprehensive technical health check&lt;/STRONG&gt; of your SAP system. It is part of SAP’s support offering and is typically generated &lt;STRONG&gt;weekly&lt;/STRONG&gt; to help detect and prevent potential issues before they impact system performance or availability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Check section “&lt;STRONG&gt;Frontend Distribution” &lt;/STRONG&gt;in BW EarlyWatch Alert reports. This section provides an overview of BW query executions, segmented by frontend tools, for the period covered in the EarlyWatch Alert (EWA) report. The data is sourced from the RSDDSTAT_OLAP view in the BW system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The availability and data for the section depends on the configuration of the EarlyWatch Alert report for BW system: e.g.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tanuj_G_0-1747615170324.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/262754iC55F9E1E9AB2056C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Tanuj_G_0-1747615170324.png" alt="Tanuj_G_0-1747615170324.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ACTION REQUIRED:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt; If there are any entries in BEx Analyzer 7.x and/or BEx Broadcaster, it is critical to initiate remediation steps to mitigate the impact of BEx End of support&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The statistics in EarlyWatch Alert report are extracted from the RSDDSTAT_OLAP view. Accuracy of the data relies on the proper enablement and execution of detailed statistics collection through transaction RSDDSTAT in SAP BW system, which must be activated for Workbooks, Queries, and InfoProviders to capture the statistics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-354886875"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Option 2:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;If EarlyWatch alert is not activated, you can login to the BW Production system, and manually check BEx tool usage accessing transaction SE16, and table RSDDSTAT_OLAP:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;BEx Analyzer / Workbook&lt;/STRONG&gt; usage:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use selection “BEX” as STEPTP field and “3200”&amp;nbsp; as EVENTID.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Number of entries &amp;gt; 0 show the usage of BEx Analyzer / Workbooks in the system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;BEx Broadcaster&lt;/STRONG&gt; usage:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use “14601”, “14611” and “14671” as EVENTID.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Number of entries &amp;gt; 0 show the usage of BEx Broadcaster (Pre-calc server) in the system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;USERID&lt;/STRONG&gt; field in the results will identify which users are actively using BEx tools&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ACTION REQUIRED:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt; &amp;nbsp;If there are any entries in either of the above cases, it is critical to initiate remediation steps to mitigate the impact of BEx end of support.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Additional Consideration&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This analysis is not limited to standalone BW systems. You can also perform this check in SAP systems with the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP_BW component&lt;/STRONG&gt;, such as &lt;STRONG&gt;ECC, SCM, or CRM etc&lt;/STRONG&gt;. While most customers leverage standalone BW for central reporting, embedded BW capabilities in source systems allow the creation and use of BEx queries locally; another area that must be assessed during BEx deprecation planning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-158373370"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;How can SAP Services help?&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-220025303"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color="#003366"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BEx Workbooks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;To ensure continuity and supportability, all BEx Workbooks should be migrated to SAP Analysis for Microsoft Office (AO). For customers with &lt;STRONG&gt;only a few BEx Workbooks&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESSOBJECTS_ANALYSIS_OFFICE/ca9c58444d64420d99d6c136a3207632/f272193a6c9b1014bf2c9a7eb0e91070.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;manual migration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; may be more practical.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For customers with a &lt;STRONG&gt;large number of BEx Workbooks&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP offers a tool for&amp;nbsp;Automated Mass Conversion Tool to accelerate and facilitate the conversion process from BEx (Analyzer) Workbooks to Analysis for Office Workbooks. The Automated Mass Conversion Tool is 6x to 8x faster than the manual conversion method, conversion of 100 Workbooks take around 5-6 Minutes, compared to at least 30 seconds per one workbook in case of manual conversion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tanuj_G_0-1747600430151.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/262747iA03B298C2E4A8BB4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Tanuj_G_0-1747600430151.png" alt="Tanuj_G_0-1747600430151.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This service is available for both&amp;nbsp;MaxAttention (Premium Engagement)&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Professional Services customers, if you would like to request it or find out more about it please contact your&amp;nbsp;Engagement Architect,&amp;nbsp;Technical Quality Manager,&amp;nbsp;Account Manager&amp;nbsp;or you can reach out to us via the&amp;nbsp;email:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="mailto:PremiumHubCoE_BExtoAO_Migration@sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;A href="mailto:PremiumHubCoE_BExtoAO_Migration@sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;PremiumHubCoE_BExtoAO_Migration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--474205297"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BEx Broadcaster (Pre-calculation)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unlike BEx Workbooks, which benefit from SAP’s Mass Conversion Tool for migration to Analysis for Office, BEx Broadcaster (Pre-calculation) presents a different challenge. There are following replacement options available:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Analysis for Microsoft Office (AO) with Scheduling via BI Platform&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) Publication&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is no automated conversion tool available for migrating broadcasting scenarios to replacement alternatives. Customers must manually rebuild scheduling and distribution logic from scratch using supported replacement options.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--83912788"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;&lt;U&gt;Conclusion&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The sunset of BEx tools marks the end of an era. While many customers have already transitioned to modern alternatives, there are customers who still rely on BEx tools particularly BEx Workbooks and Broadcaster for critical reporting and scheduling needs. With the hard deadline of October 14’ 2025 fast approaching, it is essential for customers to take care of their current BEx usage across the SAP ecosystem, especially within SAP BW environments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Organizations with a significant footprint of BEx Workbooks should be aware that migrating to SAP Analysis for Office can require substantial time and manual effort. SAP offers a Mass Conversion Tool and expert services through SAP MaxAttention and the CoE teams to accelerate this process and reduce the operational burden.
