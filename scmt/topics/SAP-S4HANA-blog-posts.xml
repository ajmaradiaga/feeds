    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;New ABAP AI capabilities keep coming&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule for Developers, ABAP AI capabilities remain free of charge&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Availability of ABAP AI in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition in release 2025 is ahead of us&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP AI will be available in older releases of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition as well, details and updates expected at TechEd.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In February 2025, we started the first chapter of ABAP AI and announced that &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-speaks-abap/ba-p/14018226" target="_blank"&gt;Joule speaks ABAP&lt;/A&gt;. Now, it’s time to get ready for chapter 2!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the past months, we have been delivering&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; more Joule skills to speed up ABAP Cloud development, and we are now able to create RAP business objects – from the database table up to the UI service powered by generative AI. We can create unit tests, explain code, complete code in the editor, implement validations and determinations, and much more (see also our &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/02/b4f714de-f57e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;public slide deck&lt;/A&gt;). All these skills are part of the 2508 release of SAP BTP ABAP Environment and SAP Cloud ERP (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition), and they will be included in the SAP Cloud ERP Private (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition) in the 2025 release. Please check out our &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-rap120/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;updated tutorial&lt;/A&gt; on ABAP AI capabilities. In addition, we will continue to expand our AI scope and will deliver on the transformation aspect of our AI strategy. This starts with the 2025 delivery for SAP Cloud ERP Private, followed by AI capabilities in the custom code migration app in SAP BTP ABAP Environment 2602. Please visit our &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cross-product/roadmap-info/genai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;roadmap&lt;/A&gt; to keep track of our deliveries.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let’s continue with commercials&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and keep it short: The free promotions we introduced at the beginning of the year &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/unlock-sap-joule-for-developers-claim-your-free-access-today/ba-p/14183158" target="_blank"&gt;have been extended&lt;/A&gt; until further notice! We are convinced that, in the current situation, we don’t want to put any commercial barriers on our offering and let all customers and partners benefit from AI-driven development. The corresponding material numbers for customers 8019124&amp;nbsp;and TDD partners 8019541&amp;nbsp;remain the same and can be ordered again. For those who started before the extension of the promotion, note that a re-ordering of the material is required. The procedure for the SAP BTP ABAP Environment and SAP Cloud ERP remains the same as well, and the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-speaks-abap/ba-p/14018226" target="_blank"&gt;initial blog post&lt;/A&gt; has been updated to reflect this, as well as &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3571857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Note 3571857&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;For SAP Cloud ERP Private, as of release 2025, the material numbers are also valid. However, the configuration will need to be done manually by you. Detailed information on this will follow.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;But that is not enough. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Will ABAP AI capabilities become available also for older releases of SAP Cloud ERP Private? Yes!&lt;BR /&gt;Imagine an ABAP AI service running side-by-side to your ABAP instance, providing full access to ABAP AI capabilities across hybrid landscapes. This includes SAP BTP ABAP Environment, SAP Cloud ERP, and SAP Cloud ERP Private. New AI innovations become available independently of release upgrades or support packages, allowing immediate leveraging. &amp;nbsp;Best of all, this ABAP AI service can also be connected to older releases of SAP Cloud ERP Private.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sounds like a dream? Let’s find out – stay tuned for TechEd 2025 to receive all the news and updates!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

This app is intended for administrators to troubleshoot the EWA process. This blog will provide a more detailed description of the Status App functionality.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;EWA session data can be sent to SAP through various methods. The EWA session data can be sent directly to SAP through the HTTP destination SAP-SUPPORT_PORTAL (via SAP-SUPPORT_PARCELBOX) from either an &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/help/9b304f6aea25485192e911d8a9c026fe/3025d1eba03d48c8af97bead0b1f5129.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ABAP managed system&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; or an &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2454045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Solution Manager&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; system. Additionally, any EWA session data for systems managed by the ECS team are sent via their SAP Focused Run systems on SAP side to be processed. The following Notes and KBAs are provided for more information on all three scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/207223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;207223&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - SAP EarlyWatch Alert Processed at SAP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1684537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1684537&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - EarlyWatch Alert Not Sent to SAP: Troubleshooting Guide - SAP Solution Manager&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2930644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2930644&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - SAP Focused Run: EarlyWatch Alert Troubleshooting Guide - Guided Answer&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;After sending EWA session data through one of the available methods it can be unclear whether the EWA data was successfully received by SAP or if there was any issue with the EWA session processing. The EWA Status App allows you to follow the status of your EWA report once it’s sent to SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All EWA session data sent to SAP will be available for review in the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/ewa/status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;EWA Status App&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, here you will find various details about the EWA sessions you have sent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can see the date the EWA session data session was sent, if they have been successfully received by SAP, as well as whether the EWA session could be processed successful or has been generated and posted in the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/app/ewaworkspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;EWA workspace&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since the EWA session data packages sent to SAP are processed in randomly assigned batches for all customers it can take from a few hours to a few days for your EWA result to be available in various SAP applications like the EWA Workspace, Solution Finder, EWA Dashboard, or as a Word document available for download. Using the Status App allows you to track this process without opening a case.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The general fields available in the EWA Status App that are applicable for all system types are the following columns.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;System&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Product&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sending System Product&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data Received at SAP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Collected At&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The “System” and “Product” columns will list the long and short SID as well as the product version respectively of the EWA target system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The “Sending System Product” column, however, will display the product version of the system that transferred the session data to SAP. This is most often a Solution Manager or Focused Run system. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, the “Data Received at SAP” and “Collected at” columns document the date and time the EWA session package was received by SAP as well as when it was collected on the managed system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Griffin1_0-1757446491965.png" style="width: 917px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311910iEDAFAD810D66CB78/image-dimensions/917x399/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="917" height="399" role="button" title="Griffin1_0-1757446491965.png" alt="Griffin1_0-1757446491965.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Transfer Status Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the EWA Status App the “Data Transfer Status Details” column can have one of three status’. The status’ are Rejected, Ignored, Success. As you would expect Success simply indicates the EWA session data was successfully transferred to SAP. The other two status’ can be indicative of various errors. I will describe the most common in more detail below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;"&lt;STRONG&gt;Ignored (duplicate)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This status indicates that the EWA is sent multiple times per week for the same system. You should check to see if the EWA is being sent from both Solution Manager and the managed system. The same checks should be performed for on prem FRUN systems. The EWA could also be sent multiple times per week from the same system. All will result in the same status.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Ignored (not in allow list)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This status can be caused by a few errors. However, the most common would be that either the license or maintenance certificate for the system is expired.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Review the SLICENSE transaction in Solution Manager if used as well as the managed system to ensure both are up to date.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Rejected (system time in future)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system runs with a system time deviating from official time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The System Time can be synced manually by your system Admin. However, it is likely that this is a temporary change for testing purposes and it will sync automatically via Internet. If not working, your Admin can start this sync process at the OS Level.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Rejected (no data)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The service data that arrived at SAP is either not readable or empty or incomplete and thus important parts are completely missing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This would indicate that there are issues with EWA session data collection or service data quality. We recommend reviewing the resolution steps in the KBA &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1824881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1824881&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - Summary of Grey Rated EWA Reports - SAP Solution Manager.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Rejected (non-productive)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Only for productive and test systems the&amp;nbsp;EWA&amp;nbsp;is processed at SAP. Based on the system role the service data can be rejected. This is true for managed systems before ST-PI 740 SP23 (ST-PI 2008_1_7xx SP33) more information on the adjusted criteria can be found in SAP Note &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/207223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;207223&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - SAP EarlyWatch Alert Processed at SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Rejected (not authorized)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The technical communication user used for upload is not authorized to upload for this system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Or&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The technical communication user used for upload is not valid anymore.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Or&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The user used for upload is not a technical communication user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You will need to ensure the S user assigned to both the SAP-SUPPORT_PORTAL and SAP-SUPPORT_PACELBOX HTTP destinations is a valid technical user. The following KBA outlines the requirements for the assigned user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2174416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2174416&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - Creation and activation of Technical Communication Users - SAP for Me&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Rejected (other reason)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Create a case with component SV-SCS-EWA-GEN.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Rejected (content size exceeds limit)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The service data exceeds the size limit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Rejected (unknown system type)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supported technical system types are ABAP, HANA,&amp;nbsp;JAVA&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;BOBJ.&amp;nbsp;When extracting the leading system from the service data either no technical system type was determined, or the technical system type is not supported by EarlyWatch Alert.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recommendation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If using Solution Manager it is recommended that you review the system information maintained in LMDB. Ensure the technical system type is maintained and that it is a supported type.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, in some scenarios is may be required to replace the SDCCN service definitions. The following KBA outlines the process and under which circumstances these steps should be performed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP KBA &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1765141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1765141&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - When should the Service Definitions be completely replaced (Delete and Download) using the steps outlined in SAP Note 727998?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"Rejected (data too old)"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The service data that was sent to SAP was collected more than 112 days ago. Such old service data is not processed by SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Details on Report Status, Dashboard Status, and Solution Finder Status &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These three columns are relatively binary. The Status can either be “Success” or “Missing” / blank. In rare instances you can receive the status “Error (Initialization Failed)”. In this instance a case should be opened in the SV-SMG-SER-EWA component area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Report Status will be successful when the EWA document has been successfully generated. Until this point this column will remain blank. As mentioned previously it can take from a few hours to several days for your EWA result to be available. If the EWA session data was successfully received by SAP there is no cause for concern if the EWA report is not immediately available.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The same is true of the columns “Dashboard Status” and “Solution Finder Status”. When these applications are fully populated the EWA column status here in the Status App will change to Success. Prior to this the status will remain either blank or have the status “Missing”. Neither status is a cause for concern. If after several days the status of these columns remains unpopulated you should open a case in the SV-SMG-SER-EWA component area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2 Billion Record Limit Status and Number Range Forecast Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This column is system dependent. These checks are in reference to the maximum table size for HANA systems. The maximum table size cannot exceed 2 billion records for a HANA system without detrimental impact to the system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, the status “Missing” is most often applied to systems that do not have a HANA component. This information is not relevant to your system if you do not have a HANA Component and is not a cause for concern. You should review the EWA for the affected system to confirm that there is no associated HANA DB.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For HANA systems where this check was not successfully performed the status will instead be “No Forecast”, “Partial Success”, or “Unconfident Forecast”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These may be a cause for concern and your first steps should be to review the RTCCTOOL recommendations of both the managed system and Solution Manager. You are looking for any red warning objects related to HANA session data, ST-PI, or ST-A/PI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More information about the exact limitations of HANA are documented in the KBA &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2154870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2154870&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - How-To: Understanding and defining SAP HANA Limitations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, more information can be found in the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/forecast-in-sap-earlywatch-alert-workspace-how-to-avoid-a-table-in-a-sap/ba-p/13365651" target="_blank"&gt;HANA Sizing Blog&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

In Part 2(&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-business-data-cloud-series-part-2-extend-sap-s-4hana-managed-data/ba-p/14174030" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Business Data Cloud Series – Part 2: Extend SAP S/4HANA Managed Data Products&lt;/A&gt;) we explored on how to extend SAP S/4HANA Data Products. Now, in Part 3, we dive into the practical aspect of creating custom data products for the source SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and Share it with SAP databricks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this article, we’ll explore a common scenario where a customer has a custom CDS entity in SAP S/4HANA and wants to harmonize its data with SAP-managed data products. We’ll demonstrate how to create a custom data product based on that custom CDS entity, for example, ZCDS_CAMPAIGN and how to delta-share with SAP databricks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-291092332" id="toc-hId-1671390090"&gt;High-level Workflow for the SAP S/4HANA, Customer Managed Data Product:&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jeetendrakapase_0-1757470973135.png" style="width: 687px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311976i51D2FC53385CC525/image-dimensions/687x623/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="687" height="623" role="button" title="jeetendrakapase_0-1757470973135.png" alt="jeetendrakapase_0-1757470973135.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1669508416" id="toc-hId-1474876585"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Steps to create a SAP S/4HANA Customer Managed Data Product.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Identify, create, or extend a CDS entity: &lt;/STRONG&gt;To build a customer-managed data product in an SAP S/4HANA system, the recommended approach is to leverage CDS views/entities. In this example, we’ll create a custom CDS entity as shown below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note: &lt;EM&gt;As a best practice, customers should&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;leverage SAP-released CDS views first&lt;/STRONG&gt;, extend them where needed, and only create&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;custom CDS views&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;when business requirements demand it. This is fully permissible under the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;clean core paradigm&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as business requirements ultimately take priority.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ObjectModel.usageType.dataClass: #TRANSACTIONAL

Now let us create the customer managed data product and share with the SAP databricks. You can also share the local table from HANA Data Lake File space to HANA cloud DB space and build the models on top of it, e.g. Building a report that provides access to 5 years of worth where most recent 2 years are persisted on the storage type in-memory/disk while rest 3 years are persisted on the storage type file and union model is build to combine this data.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATASPHERE/e4059f908d16406492956e5dbcf142dc/b07e95d07a1e4569b87d9bb57b732bcf.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Creating Custom Delta Share Data Products&lt;/A&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Create a Formations Profile with Data Product visibility option as &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Formations&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jeetendrakapase_0-1757467550978.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311958i6D00AC8A9FC574C0/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jeetendrakapase_0-1757467550978.png" alt="jeetendrakapase_0-1757467550978.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jeetendrakapase_0-1757467495757.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311957i847F2827DE17D1C9/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jeetendrakapase_0-1757467495757.png" alt="jeetendrakapase_0-1757467495757.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;Context is automatically created.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jeetendrakapase_1-1757467607998.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311959iDEA2E0477BF42366/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jeetendrakapase_1-1757467607998.png" alt="jeetendrakapase_1-1757467607998.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9.

We walked through setting up prerequisites like the Cloud Connector, creating a Datasphere file space, and configuring connections. Using the &lt;STRONG&gt;bronze–silver transformation approach&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we replicated and refined campaign data for harmonization. Finally, we created and published a &lt;STRONG&gt;custom Delta Share data product&lt;/STRONG&gt;, making it discoverable in the BDC Catalog and consumable in SAP Databricks for advanced analytics and ML scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1760089728"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introduction and Overview&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog presents an end-to-end architecture for SAP Emarsys Loyalty, bringing together loyalty program design, omnichannel engagement, and closed-loop financial posting to strengthen repeat purchases and customer lifetime value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It provides a structured view of how the solution is organized—covering applications, modules, and data objects and illustrates core processes such as onboarding, plan and tier-based accrual, voucher or points redemption, and service-driven adjustments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, it explains how segmentation, personalization tokens, and analytics with Datasphere and SAC will be leveraged to operationalize loyalty programs and measure outcomes across channels.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1563576223"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Architecture&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The following reference architecture explains how SAP Emarsys Loyalty can be implemented with other SAP solutions, though it may vary for different customer implementations depending on the systems they use.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Emarsys Loyalty Architecture" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313899iB261644EAF386386/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sandeepmkh_0-1757745568012.png" alt="Emarsys Loyalty Architecture" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Emarsys Loyalty Architecture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on this reference architecture, the following SAP solutions are proposed for integration with SAP Emarsys Loyalty.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP S/4 HANA will handle loyalty points earned through transactions such as sales orders and retail purchases, with real-time posting of point accruals and redemptions to ensure financial accuracy.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Web or mobile apps may be used to let customers check their loyalty activity, view offers and exclusive access, and track points, tiers, and plans through a digital wallet.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Service Cloud will give customer service agents a complete view of the loyalty profile, including tier, balance, and past redemptions, enabling them to resolve issues like missing points, redemption problems, or upgrades.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Campaign channels such as email, mobile, and web will be used to run loyalty campaigns, encourage purchases, share offers, and update customers on their tier or points status.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Finally, SAP Datasphere and SAP Analytics Cloud will provide reports, dashboards, and stories related to loyalty performance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1367062718"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1170549213"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;End-to-End Loyalty process flow&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1103118427"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customer Registration and Loyalty on Boarding&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customer registration and loyalty onboarding start with joining the program to enjoy benefits from purchases and activities. New customers can enroll during registration, while existing customers can join anytime. For both, a hash ID must be generated and assigned to their record before they can join. Enrollment can be done through mobile apps, websites, or POS systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="sandeepmkh_0-1757744730518.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313893i5C6BF8A2A81166DC/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sandeepmkh_0-1757744730518.png" alt="sandeepmkh_0-1757744730518.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-906604922"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-710091417"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Points accrual&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Points accrual allows customers to earn loyalty points and benefits based on their purchases and activities. For purchases, data is sent from SAP ERP to Smart Insight and then to Loyalty, where points and benefits are calculated based on the customer’s plan and tier. The confirmed points are then sent back to SAP ERP/S4 HANA for financial posting.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="sandeepmkh_1-1757744730528.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313894iDC480DE3D72A520C/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sandeepmkh_1-1757744730528.png" alt="sandeepmkh_1-1757744730528.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-513577912"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Points Redemption:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At checkout, customers can either use an existing voucher they have already claimed or pay directly with their points. When a voucher is claimed, the points are redeemed at that time.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;In this blog, we’ll explore a practical use case implemented in&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA 2021 On-Premise&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where we opted for&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Business Objects (CBO)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;to enable table maintenance via Fiori with minimal development effort and also &lt;STRONG&gt;evaluate new frameworks&lt;/STRONG&gt; to achieve this in &lt;STRONG&gt;latest S4/HANA release 2023&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2018320602"&gt;&lt;FONT face="trebuchet ms,geneva"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Approach for choosing Custom Business Object&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Decision Matrix)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;CBO is based on BOPF framework which was widely used by SAP before the era of RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming), while this is still relevant, SAP has now moved to RAP based development and a new concept called custom business configuration, both will be covered later in context of data maintenance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1950889816"&gt;&lt;FONT face="trebuchet ms,geneva"&gt;Why we didn’t choose RAP or Custom business configuration for this use case.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Custom business configuration ( Business configuration maintenance object ) – This is available from S4 On-Prem 2022 onwards and the Fiori app for CUBCO is available after 2023 onwards.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;RESTful ABAP Programming – SAP has provided RAP Generator which can generate all the artefacts based on a table right from views, behavior definition , service binding , generation to Fiori app however this is also not available in On-Prem 2021, the other workaround could be to build all these artefacts manually and generate Fiori app which was going to take more development time, hence it was avoided.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Since we cannot go with above 2 options, the only 2 options left are SM30 and Custom Business object, as we want to move towards Fiori first approach, Custom business object was chosen as the Go to approach. Let us deep dive in this with the help of use- case and practical tips&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1625293592"&gt;&lt;FONT face="trebuchet ms,geneva"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is Custom Business Object –&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;With the Custom Business Objects Fiori app, you can create and manage custom business objects. A custom business object is a hierarchical set of database tables with an API for creation, retrieval, update and deletion of data.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;In The Fiori App ‘Custom Business Object’, a new BO has been defined and maintained as below.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;User can choose what options do they want as part of framework, e,g, Change document, system admin date (last change at, created at etc are added by default).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;User interface is disabled in this since it is only possible to enable if Embedded gateway is used which is not the case here.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Saurabh_Gupta1_2-1758034866616.png" style="width:

are free to choose what kind of operations, out of CUD, should be supported in the BO out of box.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline"

(Table Maintenance)-&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;As discussed above, there are 2 other ways to achieve this with minimal

Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;FONT face="tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;This is &lt;STRONG&gt;recommended &lt;/STRONG&gt;approach going forward where a business configuration maintenance object serves as primary entry point for maintenance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We have the option to use the Generate ABAP Repository Objects Wizard for Business configuration maintenance object to generate all required development objects based on a customizing table&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Based on the Business configuration maintenance object, the custom business configurations app renders a&amp;nbsp;Fiori element list report for the entities exposed by the service binding to maintain the configuration entries&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Saurabh_Gupta1_11-1758035471221.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This blog describes setup of the withholding tax using integration from &lt;/SPAN&gt;SAP &lt;SPAN&gt;Treasury and Risk Management &lt;/SPAN&gt;(treasury) &lt;SPAN&gt;to the extended withholding&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; tax in &lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Accounting&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt; Besides the calculation and accounting this integration also ensures that corresponding withholding tax information is added to the resulting accounting documents. Such documents are included in standard legal reports in a given country. There are also other possibilities to calculate and account withholding taxes, e.g. using derived flows, however the resulting documents usually lack all the necessary withholding tax information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Pre-delivered configuration in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud enables posting to supplier. However, this example scenario &lt;SPAN&gt;covers&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;withholding tax on incoming interests in money market instruments posted to customer &lt;/STRONG&gt;to describe all configuration steps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We focus on the configuration and master data related to withholding tax, we expect that &lt;SPAN&gt;you have already complete&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;d&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; general s&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;etup for &lt;/SPAN&gt;treasury and for the extended withholding tax in Financial Accounting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1630948447"&gt;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Customizing &lt;SPAN&gt;P&lt;/SPAN&gt;rerequisites&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;w&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ithholding tax code&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; and &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;tax type &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;are defined in &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Accounting&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;withholding tax code i&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;s defined as &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Payment Time&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, the system generates the withholding tax only at the time of payment in the transaction &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;F110&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; (Automatic Payment)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &lt;SPAN&gt;In this case, t&lt;/SPAN&gt;reasury generates only&lt;SPAN&gt; an&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;empty flow&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; and &lt;SPAN&gt;a &lt;/SPAN&gt;corresponding item for table WITH_ITEM with &lt;STRONG&gt;withholding&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;tax base amount&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;withholding tax code&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; is defined as &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Invoice &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;T&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ime,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; the system generates the withholding tax line item in the accounting document of the interest. Treasury &lt;SPAN&gt;then &lt;/SPAN&gt;generates &lt;SPAN&gt;a&lt;/SPAN&gt; flow with &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;withholding tax amount.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1434434942"&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Customizing in Treasury&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1367004156"&gt;2.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Define &lt;SPAN&gt;U&lt;/SPAN&gt;pdate &lt;SPAN&gt;T&lt;/SPAN&gt;ype for &lt;SPAN&gt;W&lt;/SPAN&gt;ithholding &lt;SPAN&gt;T&lt;/SPAN&gt;ax&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our example we use update type &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TAXWH01&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1170490651"&gt;2.2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Define Account &lt;SPAN&gt;D&lt;/SPAN&gt;etermination for &lt;SPAN&gt;I&lt;/SPAN&gt;nterest&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The extended withholding tax requires posting to supplier/customer, therefore it is necessary to set up account determination for interest in treasury accordingly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1103059865"&gt;2.2.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Posting &lt;SPAN&gt;S&lt;/SPAN&gt;pecification&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It c&lt;/SPAN&gt;ontains document type for posting on customer and GL account&lt;SPAN&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;/SPAN&gt;posting key for debit entry is for customer, &lt;SPAN&gt;and the &lt;/SPAN&gt;account symbol has posting category&lt;SPAN&gt; for&lt;/SPAN&gt; subledger posting in &lt;SPAN&gt;p&lt;/SPAN&gt;ayment &lt;SPAN&gt;c&lt;/SPAN&gt;urrency&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rudolf_brysa_1-1757586586005.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312899iEA99D2AC7CA2B1AC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rudolf_brysa_1-1757586586005.png" alt="rudolf_brysa_1-1757586586005.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-906546360"&gt;2.2.2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Assign &lt;SPAN&gt;U&lt;/SPAN&gt;pdate &lt;SPAN&gt;T&lt;/SPAN&gt;ype to &lt;SPAN&gt;P&lt;/SPAN&gt;osting &lt;SPAN&gt;S&lt;/SPAN&gt;pecification&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is important to mark the indication Payment Transaction in the assignment of the update type to posting specification&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rudolf_brysa_13-1757586992709.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312914i9F47D361469C74C2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rudolf_brysa_13-1757586992709.png" alt="rudolf_brysa_13-1757586992709.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-580950136"&gt;2.3&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Specify Flow Attributes for Extended Withholding Tax&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this activity we assign the withholding tax update type to the interest update type&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note.

The cash flow in &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TPM13 &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;serves as a good indication whether everything is set up correctly and the withholding tax is generated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-142150473"&gt;4.2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Post financial transaction&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The withholding tax is posted together with the interest in the transaction &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TBB1&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; (Fix, Pay, and Post Flows)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. There is a limitation in posting log, which puts withholding tax in two&lt;SPAN&gt;-&lt;/SPAN&gt;line items, whereas resulting accounting document has only one line item for withholding tax.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rudolf_brysa_9-1757586586017.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312910i52157973086814F5/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rudolf_brysa_9-1757586586017.png" alt="rudolf_brysa_9-1757586586017.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rudolf_brysa_10-1757586586019.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312911i9D50BD2B14084F0F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rudolf_brysa_10-1757586586019.png" alt="rudolf_brysa_10-1757586586019.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For more information about the&lt;/SPAN&gt; basic settings for&lt;SPAN&gt; with&lt;/SPAN&gt;h&lt;SPAN&gt;olding tax, see &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/e5ec5859d8e54df98492d80564a734c0/da3707b7b57a47ddb4702a0051b1da7c.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=DRAFT&amp;amp;version=2208.500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Withholding Tax in Treasury.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;When adopting &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SAM4U&lt;/STRONG&gt;, one of the biggest challenges customers face is handling role, profile, and authorization changes without disrupting production. This is where the &lt;STRONG&gt;Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt; brings real value, thanks to its &lt;STRONG&gt;simulation capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Customers Expect from Authorization Simulation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the simulation, customers get the ability to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Log changes at the &lt;STRONG&gt;role or profile level&lt;/STRONG&gt; on the system dataset.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Track and review roles and profiles that have been modified.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Revert changes at the role or profile level, either all at once or individually.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Modify user-to-role or user-to-profile assignments.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Perform &lt;STRONG&gt;mass unassignments&lt;/STRONG&gt; of roles and profiles (e.g., removing &lt;EM&gt;SAP_ALL&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;SAP_NEW&lt;/EM&gt;).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Identify and review changes made to users.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Revert user assignments back to their original state when needed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_01_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317554i8A3DE036559FED09/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_01_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_01_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 01 Roles and Profiles Changes Tracking&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_02_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317555iCA2DE811D6AE8C89/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_02_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_02_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 02 Roles and Profiles Mass Unassignment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_03_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317556iFCDF5954F9E81B88/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_03_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_03_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 03 Changes to the Role Detailed Review&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But that’s not all! The real power lies in managing &lt;STRONG&gt;simulation snapshots&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_04_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317557i35353604B93F864F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_04_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_04_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 04 Snapshots of Simulations on the System’s Dataset Level&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Simulation Snapshots Matter&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Simulation snapshots are created at the system dataset level, allowing you to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Save changes without applying them directly in production.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create new consolidations from modified datasets.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Avoid repetitive, time-consuming rework when changes cannot be applied immediately.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example: Working with Two Systems in Consolidation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine you are analyzing two systems in a consolidation project. You make changes to roles and users in both systems. However, due to restrictions, you cannot yet apply changes in &lt;STRONG&gt;System A&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Without losing your work, you can:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a new consolidation using the dataset from System A and the modified snapshot from System B.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Or temporarily move the snapshot from System A into the dataset, and later reapply those changes when they are ready for production.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_05_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317558i6212A14A1613138A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_05_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_05_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 05 The Power of Management Snapshots and Datasets that are Used in Consolidation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This flexibility ensures you never have to redo your work and can manage changes efficiently.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Customers Prefer the Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customers appreciate the simulation feature because it provides:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System-level flexibility&lt;/STRONG&gt; to manage changes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Easy-to-handle snapshots that can be created, reviewed, reverted, and reused.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No duplication of effort, once a change is made, it is saved and can be reapplied.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reliable validation, you can reload fresh production data and check if changes were successfully implemented.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If changes were tracked only at the consolidation level, fresh data from the system would overwrite them. This is why the Accelerator focuses on &lt;STRONG&gt;system snapshots&lt;/STRONG&gt;, giving customers full control to experiment, validate, and roll back whenever needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_06_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317559i7B381AA062ADA23C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_06_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_06_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic.06 Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption Dashboard for Simulation Results Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the &lt;STRONG&gt;Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;, simulation becomes not just a test environment, but a &lt;STRONG&gt;strategic tool for efficient and risk-free SAM4U adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Understanding Release Contracts (C0–C3) in S/4HANA Repository Objects</title>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1760923042"&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Introduction&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;This blog is the first in a short series about extension and API stability in S/4HANA. In this post I’ll explain &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;release contracts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; (also known as &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;stability contracts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;) — what they are, why SAP uses them, and how they affect the objects you work with every day.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;A &lt;STRONG&gt;Release Contract&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a classification that indicates how stable a repository object is and how it can be &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;used&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;extended&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;. It’s SAP’s formal promise that certain objects will remain stable across upgrades. The goal is to strike a balance: on one hand, SAP keeps the system flexible so development can continue; on the other, key technical elements are kept stable so consumers don’t need to rewrite code after every upgrade.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;To provide those guarantees, SAP defines different stability/release contracts (&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#00CCFF"&gt;C0, C1, C2, …&lt;/FONT&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Each contract describes the intended scope of use — for example, whether something is intended as &lt;FONT color="#99CC00"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;a safe extension point&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#339966"&gt;a stable in-system API&lt;/FONT&gt;,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;FONT color="#808000"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;a remote API for external callers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1564409537"&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Stability Contracts&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;C0 : Contract for Extensions&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;C1 : Contract for System Internal Use&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;C2 : Contract for Remote API Use&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;C3 : Manage Configuration Content&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;C4 : Use in ABAP Managed Database Procedure ( Not covered in this blog )&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;Let us look at how these Contracts apply to comman repository Objects.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;U&gt;CDS Views&lt;/U&gt; : CDS views are one of the most common repository objects you’ll come across in S/4HANA. SAP uses release contracts to make clear whether a CDS view can be &lt;SPAN&gt;extended&lt;/SPAN&gt;, &lt;SPAN&gt;consumed inside the system&lt;/SPAN&gt;, or even &lt;SPAN&gt;exposed to the outside world.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1496978751"&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;C0 - Extend&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;A C0 contract means the CDS view can be &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;safely extended&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;There are two main ways to extend&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key user Extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt; : add your own custom fields (or sometimes even make standard fields available) using the Custom Fields app in FIORI.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Developer Extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt; :&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;Use ABAP Development Tools (ADT) to create a CDS view extension.

Although there are other blogs that go deep into specific object types, this post is meant as a pre-read to give you the holistic view. And if you want to actually find released objects and their contracts, the magic lies in the &lt;STRONG&gt;System Library&lt;/STRONG&gt; in ADT — and how you configure the tree.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1760954663"&gt;Introduction:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this article, we will explore SAP Cloud Connector what it is, its purpose, and the scenarios where it becomes essential. Whether you are working with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud or connecting SAP S/4HANA on-premise systems to the cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the SAP Cloud Connector plays a critical role. We will also provide a step-by-step guide on its configuration and setup, helping you seamlessly bridge your on-premise and SAP Datasphere cloud environments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1564441158"&gt;What is SAP Cloud Connector?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/cloud-connector" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Cloud Connector&lt;/A&gt; acts as a&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;secure link between SAP Datasphere and on-premises systems&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enabling seamless integration without exposing your entire internal network (behind the firewall). It runs as an on-premises agent or middleware in a secured environment and functions as a reverse invoke proxy, providing controlled access to selected systems and resources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key benefits&lt;/STRONG&gt; include fine-grained control over which on-premises systems cloud applications can access, automatic recovery of broken connections, and audit logging of inbound traffic and configuration changes. It also supports high-availability setups for enterprise scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Compared to opening firewall ports or using DMZ reverse proxies, the Cloud Connector is easier and safer to deploy. It supports multiple protocols, including HTTP and RFC for native ABAP system access, and allows secure propagation of cloud user identities to on-premises systems. With simple installation, low TCO, and standard SAP support, it’s an efficient solution for connecting cloud and on-premises landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1367927653"&gt;Does it support data encryption ?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes,&amp;nbsp;TLS encryption is used for the tunnel&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1171414148"&gt;What are the SAP Datasphere &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATASPHERE/9f804b8efa8043539289f42f372c4862/8de01dd25c1e443e8e2de7d2fbe1364d.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;data integration features, and in which scenarios is the SAP Cloud Connector required?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Replication Flows – For example, connecting to SAP ABAP CDS views and replicating data to the cloud.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data Flows – For scenarios like extracting, transforming, and loading data from on-premises sources, including SAP ABAP CDS views.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Model Import – Importing existing ABAP CDS data models from on-premises systems into SAP Datasphere for further analytics and integration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-974900643"&gt;SAP Cloud Connector &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/cloud-connector-faq" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;FAQs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-778387138"&gt;Where can I find information about SAP Cloud Connector licensing, downloading, and installation ?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2827108/E" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2827108 -

id="toc-hId--1625547575"&gt;Summary:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we saw how the SAP Cloud Connector helps connect SAP Datasphere with on-premise systems in a secure and easy way. It supports features like Replication Flows, Data Flows, and Model Import for smooth data integration. We also looked at the benefits such as simple setup, better security, high availability, and low cost. With best practices like keeping it updated, using a dedicated server, and regular monitoring, you can ensure reliable performance. Finally, we walked through the step-by-step setup to successfully link SAP S/4HANA with SAP Datasphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Enterprises are rethinking how to connect banking capabilities with ERP processes to maximize business value. Key questions include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to make payments, reconciliation, and cash visibility seamless and fully integrated between banks and the ERP system?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to adopt innovations like real-time payments or real-time cash balances without launching a new IT project every time a banking service gets added?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to unlock the combined value of invoice and payment data in the ERP alongside the cash and financial data held by banks?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP and J.P. Morgan asked themselves the same questions. And as a result decided to collaborate and partner even closer to bring more value to shared clients by better integrating the capabilities of both by accelerating adoption of SAP Multi-Bank Connectivity (MBC) to deliver J.P. Morgan bank services embedded in ERP processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With SAP MBC, corporates get direct, standardized access to J.P. Morgan banking services directly integrated into their payment and cash processes. As a result corporates can scale new services faster, without custom builds and with minimal ongoing maintenance and benefit from the seamless and many times real time data flow to get the decision advantage crucial in todays fast and ever changing business world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What you can expect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Seamless connectivity: Integrate J.P. Morgan services via SAP Multi-Bank Connectivity to connect your SAP ERP to J.P. Morgan Payments using standardized, bank-approved channels.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automate payments and reporting: The J.P. Morgan Payments Adapter 2.0 supports file-based payments (ACH, checks, virtual cards, wires—including FX) and real-time payments across the U.S., EU, UK, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Real-time insights: Access instant reporting and reconciliation, view account balances and transaction details, and track payments through advanced APIs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Easy implementation: Prebuilt adapters and help you go live quickly and securely&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-powered treasury: Leverage SAP’s cloud data foundation and AI-driven capabilities to interact with J.P. Morgan and elevate treasury operations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Who can benefit&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;New and existing J.P. Morgan clients using SAP S/4HANA (Public Cloud, Private Cloud, or On-Premise) or SAP ECC (6.0+)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Organizations operating on J.P. Morgan Access, with support for multi-bank reporting across non–J.P. Morgan DDAs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Teams seeking flexible connection options through SAP MBC to tailor integrations to specific business needs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This collaboration meets clients where they are simplifying connectivity while strengthening control and visibility at the same time, and accelerating access to new banking innovations, all embedded in SAP ERP processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Want to know more?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Multi-Bank Connectivity&amp;nbsp;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/financial-management/multi-bank-connectivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.sap.com/germany/products/financial-management/multi-bank-connectivity.html&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_MULTI_BANK_CONNECTIVITY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_MULTI_BANK_CONNECTIVITY&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;J.P.

    <content>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Good news! With the 2508 upgrade, SAP has released 12 standard, non-customizable WalkMe flows, ideal for accountants and sales representatives (no extra license; activation needed).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP recently acquired &lt;STRONG&gt;WalkMe&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which is a digital adoption platform that overlays your application to guide users how to navigate workflows step-by-step.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hi SCN Folks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hope you guys are doing great &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note: This blog does not include execution screenshots.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This post outlines a custom development approach in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Master Data Governance (MDG) to make the Tax Number field mandatory for specific Groupings. The logic is implemented using the enhancement framework via BADI: &lt;CODE&gt;USMD_RULE_SERVICE, specifically through the method CHECK_ENTITY.&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisite: A working knowledge of BADI &lt;CODE&gt;USMD_RULE_SERVICE and ABAP development is required to follow this implementation.&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;!--   StartFragment    --&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Development Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Target Groupings: &lt;CODE&gt;ZSGP, ZSGC&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Class: &lt;CODE&gt;ZMDGS_MSG_CLASS&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Number: &lt;CODE&gt;001&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Type: &lt;CODE&gt;E&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Text: &lt;CODE&gt;Tax Number is Mandatory !!!&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BADI Method Implemented: &lt;CODE&gt;IF_EX_USMD_RULE_SERVICE~CHECK_ENTITY&amp;nbsp;&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The validation logic is written directly in the method &lt;CODE&gt;CHECK_ENTITY&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;!--   EndFragment    --&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This ensures that when the specified groupings are selected, the system enforces the presence of a Tax Number and raises a custom message if it's missing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Code:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  METHOD if_ex_usmd_rule_service~check_entity.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integrating SAP S/4 HANA with Datasphere in ECS: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In today's data-driven business landscape, seamless integration between enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and advanced analytics platforms is crucial for unlocking real-time insights and driving informed decision-making. SAP Datasphere, a cloud-based data management solution, offers powerful capabilities for data modelling, federation, and replication. SAP Datasphere integration enables SAP S/4HANA system and the organizations to harmonize data from core business operations with broader analytics workflows, all, while maintaining security and compliance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Objective of this guide is to serve as a walkthrough guide for integrating S/4HANA system &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;with SAP Datasphere. However, please note that this guide is for information purpose only and the configuration steps in customers’ responsibility should be followed up by the customers accordingly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Nik13_0-1758792701406.png" style="width: 537px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/319792iE2B72ED42049AD31/image-dimensions/537x327?v=v2" width="537" height="327" role="button" title="Nik13_0-1758792701406.png" alt="Nik13_0-1758792701406.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Architecture Diagram&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites for Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before diving into the setup, please note that, for the convenience of this guide and to be in sync with the terms, here on, we will assume S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition at ECS as S/4HANA system. Which also implies customer’s current landscape (when referred as on-premise) is ‘ECS’- a managed private cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Datasphere Service Instance&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Customer should have already completed the onboarding of SAP Datasphere. It runs on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Provisioning (DP) Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Required for handling remote table data flow between on-premise and cloud. To be requested and have it provisioned accordingly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Connector&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Required to securely expose on-premise systems to the cloud without opening firewalls (reverse invoke) used for replication and live data flow connections. To be requested and have it provisioned accordingly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Network and Access&lt;/STRONG&gt;: All applicable secure network connections between S/4HANA and Datasphere based on relevant dataflows to be taken care.&lt;BR /&gt;Ex: CC for inbound dataflows from BTP to ECS and outbound internet proxy for outbound traffic from ECS to Datasphere. Also IP allowlisting for the DP Agent server and likewise.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4.1 &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;IP allowlisting Process:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In order to connect ECS instance to datasphere tenant, it requires public IP associated with customer network’s internet proxy of the ECS servers to be added in IP allowlist tab in datasphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the public IP of their CGS proxy server. Customer can follow KBA 3643152 to get this &lt;SPAN&gt;public IP.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After getting this IP, log in to Datasphere tenant&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; System &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; Configuration &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; IP Allowlist &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; Trusted Ips&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Nik13_1-1758787870371.png" style="width: 493px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/319739i5189402A782BD79E/image-dimensions/493x223?v=v2" width="493" height="223" role="button" title="Nik13_1-1758787870371.png" alt="Nik13_1-1758787870371.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Notes and Add-ons&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Implement relevant SAP Notes (e.g., 3283282 for CDS views, 3016862 for ABAP integration) in S/4HANA system and ensure the DMIS add-on is available for replication scenarios.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SICF services for live connection &lt;/STRONG&gt;: Ensure all SICF services under the node /sap/bw/ina are activated in the S/4HANA system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User Permissions&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Administrative access in Datasphere, S/4HANA, and BTP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Steps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The integration process involves configuring connectivity, setting up agents, and creating connections in Datasphere.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In the past quarter, we continued delivering many more useful features and functions in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management, and we achieved great success stories together with our customers. This blog post continues my quarterly series and gives you an overview of some of the highlights.&amp;nbsp;In this edition, I’m covering:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ERP-Centric Transport Footprint Calculation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Footprint Results – Source Input Items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GHG Data Collection API and SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Onboarding Booster&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Other Release Highlights&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer Success Stories: KNAPP &amp;amp; Tyrolit&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Upcoming Partner Webinars&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additional Information&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1632675245"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ERP-Centric Transport Footprint Calculation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transportation can be a major contributor to Scope 3 emissions, yet calculating its impact has mostly been complex and manual. With the new ERP‑centric transport footprint calculation, SAP Sustainability Footprint Management introduces a capability that &lt;STRONG&gt;leverages your existing ERP master and transactional data to automate and scale transport emission calculations&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This means you can move from spreadsheets and estimates to actual, auditable results that integrate seamlessly into both corporate and product carbon footprints.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of building transport models from scratch, the solution now derives upstream and internal transport activities from &lt;EM&gt;Goods Receipt from Supplier&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Goods Return to Supplier&lt;/EM&gt;, and &lt;EM&gt;Goods Transfer&lt;/EM&gt; data, and then calculates the footprint per activity, route, and leg. In practical terms, a transport activity is determined as the movement of specific products in given quantities between two locations under defined conditions. The system brings together master data, transaction details, and transport settings to identify source and target locations, the mode of transport, and whether goods move under ambient or temperature-controlled conditions. It then builds optimal transport routes via connection points such as airports, seaports, inland ports, and railway stations, before applying the relevant emission factors to calculate the footprint.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_prhmps10" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the following, I’ll briefly summarize the required process steps and introduce the new apps. For detailed information, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/44aa3a11015641ee9617061584b2d6c2/b5c8b3fe5f6d4579bceb804c978437ab.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Calculating Transport Footprints Using Business Transactions&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To use the new approach, start with &lt;STRONG&gt;importing transport-relevant master data&lt;/STRONG&gt;, so routing and distances work out-of-the-box. Products now carry a &lt;EM&gt;Custom Temperature Condition&lt;/EM&gt;, and SAP provides a default mapping to &lt;EM&gt;Ambient&lt;/EM&gt;. If you need temperature-controlled transport, create your own custom conditions and map them to the standard values (&lt;EM&gt;Ambient&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;Temperature-Controlled&lt;/EM&gt;). &lt;EM&gt;Locations&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;Plants&lt;/EM&gt; now support addresses and geo-coordinates, and &lt;EM&gt;Business Partners&lt;/EM&gt; can be imported with &lt;EM&gt;Supplier&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;Carrier&lt;/EM&gt; roles, including address data tied to supplier IDs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then you can &lt;STRONG&gt;configure your inventory scope&lt;/STRONG&gt; and in &lt;EM&gt;Transport Details&lt;/EM&gt; set the Data Source to &lt;EM&gt;Standard (Business Transactions)&lt;/EM&gt;. Newly created scopes default to &lt;EM&gt;Standard&lt;/EM&gt;, while existing scopes remain on &lt;EM&gt;Classic&lt;/EM&gt; until you switch them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;maintaining transport connection points&lt;/STRONG&gt; – like seaports, inland ports, airports, railway stations – go to the &lt;EM&gt;Manage Locations&lt;/EM&gt; app, where you already find SAP-delivered content for seaports and airports to help kick-start sea and air routes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Next, &lt;STRONG&gt;configure how goods typically move in your network&lt;/STRONG&gt; with the new &lt;EM&gt;Manage Transport Settings&lt;/EM&gt; app. Define haul types and distances – short haul defaults to 1500 km and can be adapted – and specify the primary mode of transport from supplier locations to one or all plants, optionally by product group. The same supplier-to-plant mode applies to returns back to the supplier. For internal logistics, create directional settings for movements between plants.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With settings in place, use the new &lt;EM&gt;Manage Transport Activities&lt;/EM&gt; app to &lt;STRONG&gt;generate transport activities&lt;/STRONG&gt; for your chosen scope and period from the ERP transactions. Once activities are clean, generate the corresponding routes and legs. In case of inconsistencies, the app guides you with messages helping you to resolve before calculation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Emission factors&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the different modes of transport are managed in the new &lt;EM&gt;Manage Transport Operation Footprints&lt;/EM&gt; app, and you can maintain them in the UI directly or import via file.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, &lt;STRONG&gt;run the transport calculation&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the new &lt;EM&gt;Calculate Transport Footprints&lt;/EM&gt; app and review results per activity, route, and leg.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the &lt;EM&gt;Calculate Footprints&lt;/EM&gt; app, the &lt;EM&gt;Data Readiness&lt;/EM&gt; tab lists transport data as one of the data types. Transport is now a first-class citizen across the analytics experience. In organizational footprint inventories, transport data becomes mandatory whenever your scope uses &lt;EM&gt;Standard&lt;/EM&gt; and transport-relevant value chain steps are enabled. Transport footprints are created as input items to products, if a carrier is specified, the corresponding business partner footprint is used as the utilized item, otherwise the input is shown as &lt;EM&gt;Unknown Carrier&lt;/EM&gt;. You can see transport-related product and business partner items in the &lt;EM&gt;Manage Footprint Results&lt;/EM&gt; app, and analyze Scope 3.4 emissions in depth in the &lt;EM&gt;Footprint Overview&lt;/EM&gt; app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A quick note on provisioning: The new apps require explicit role assignment, role names are case-sensitive, and write access requires both read and write roles. If you’re moving from the classic transport approach, reimport your enhanced master data for &lt;EM&gt;Plants&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Business Partners&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Products&lt;/EM&gt;, and relevant &lt;EM&gt;Locations&lt;/EM&gt; via file or API, then switch your inventory scopes to &lt;EM&gt;Standard (Business Transactions)&lt;/EM&gt;. Keep scopes on &lt;EM&gt;Classic&lt;/EM&gt; if you plan to recalculate them using the classic transport apps. With these pieces in place, the new transport calculation streamlines data preparation, strengthens routing fidelity, and brings transport emissions seamlessly into your product and corporate footprint story.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1436161740"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Footprint Results – Source Input Items&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;For decarbonizing your company and products, it’s crucial to have full transparency into what’s actually driving emissions across the value chain. While total product footprints are useful, they often leave a critical question unanswered:&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Where exactly do these emissions come from?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Without that level of granularity, it’s difficult to identify hotspots, prioritize reduction efforts, or make informed decisions that lead to real impact. To address this, SAP Sustainability Footprint Management now includes a new feature in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Footprint Results&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;app:&amp;nbsp;Source Input Items. This enhancement gives you a detailed view into the specific inputs that contribute to a product’s environmental footprint – enabling smarter, data-driven strategies for decarbonization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_uxkd6nir" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Source input items&lt;/EM&gt; represent the materials, energy, transport, and other resources used at the start of a process that result in emissions. With just a click on&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Generate&lt;/EM&gt;, you can now &lt;STRONG&gt;explore these contributors for each footprint item&lt;/STRONG&gt; (excluding items of type&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;business partner&lt;/EM&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;work in progress&lt;/EM&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;production documents&lt;/EM&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;supplier&lt;/EM&gt;). Note that &lt;EM&gt;source input items &lt;/EM&gt;currently cannot yet be generated for calculation results involving cycles, this will be added in a future release.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The app provides you with various charts that instantly &lt;STRONG&gt;visualize emissions across&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;lifecycle stages&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;such as material acquisition, production, transport, and end-of-life treatment. These charts help you pinpoint the most emission-intensive stages and align your analysis with the GHG Protocol. You can also customize the view to match your specific reporting or decision-making needs. Below the chart, a consolidated table provides full transparency into each source input item.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this enhancement, SAP Sustainability Footprint Management strengthens its role as an &lt;STRONG&gt;intuitive product fact sheet&lt;/STRONG&gt;, empowering you to go beyond high-level metrics. You can now&amp;nbsp;trace emissions to their source, understand their context, and take targeted action – whether that means switching suppliers, optimizing logistics, or redesigning products. For all information, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/44aa3a11015641ee9617061584b2d6c2/f92e926c08024ddfadbb52e25cce36d0.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Viewing the Footprint Results&lt;/A&gt; on SAP Help.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1239648235"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;GHG Data Collection API and SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the recurring challenges in tracking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the complexity and scale of data collection. Sustainability teams often need to gather activity and spend data from various business units, geographies, or partner organizations. To address these hurdles, we now released the &lt;STRONG&gt;GHG Data Forms API&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This new public API empowers you to extend and tailor the GHG data collection process far beyond the core application: External workflows, survey applications, or even mobile apps can now retrieve, maintain, and push data directly into the GHG Data Forms in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management. By decentralizing and parallelizing how and where environmental data is gathered, you can drive faster, more automated, and more consistent emission data capture across your full operational or organizational boundary. For technical details and integration guidelines, refer to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/GHGDataFormsAPIV1/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;official API documentation&lt;/A&gt; on SAP Business Accelerator Hub.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One powerful example of leveraging this API is through&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt;. With SAP Build workflows, you can automate and streamline sustainability data collection across multiple locations. The process begins by triggering a workflow, either manually or on a scheduled basis, then retrieving all relevant business activities and locations from SAP Sustainability Footprint Management using the API. Through parallel subprocesses for each location, you can enable simultaneous data collection and significantly reduce cycle time. Business users receive customizable forms – survey-style via SAP Build or ticket-style via SAP Task Center – delivered directly to the right people based on responsibility rules, with built-in notifications and reminders to keep the process moving. Once data is submitted, it’s routed for approval, and after validation, posted back to SAP Sustainability Footprint Management and included into the overall footprint calculation. This approach provides flexibility, scalability, and compliance, helping sustainability teams focus on insights rather than manual tasks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_4fayn6vz" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1043134730"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Onboarding Booster&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the introduction of the Onboarding Booster, we’re &lt;STRONG&gt;speeding up the time required for setting up am SAP Sustainability Footprint Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; tenant on SAP BTP. The entire onboarding can now be completed in about 10 to 15 minutes through a guided, automated process. The booster is integrated into the SAP BTP cockpit and walks you through the essential steps: checking prerequisites, selecting the identity service, and either creating or choosing a subaccount. Once these steps are confirmed, the system takes over and performs the necessary configurations in the background. The result is a fully prepared environment that is ready for role assignment and productive use. This is more than just a time saver, it reduces complexity and lowers the barrier for customers to get started quickly and confidently.

See &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/44aa3a11015641ee9617061584b2d6c2/f8f943508363488ba184965cf4442d46.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Creating Business Activities&lt;/A&gt; for more information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, when setting your footprint inventory scope, &lt;STRONG&gt;plant assignments now ensure that only relevant forms are generated&lt;/STRONG&gt; for your selected companies and locations. This prevents the creation of irrelevant forms, enhancing efficiency and streamlining the data collection process.&amp;nbsp;Learn more here: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/44aa3a11015641ee9617061584b2d6c2/f8f943508363488ba184965cf4442d46.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Creating Business Activities&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-650107720"&gt;Customer Success Stories&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;KNAPP AG&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a global leader in intralogistics and warehouse automation, faced new challenges with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which raised the bar for ESG transparency. Instead of waiting for deadlines, KNAPP acted early, building a strong sustainability data foundation with SAP Sustainability solutions.&amp;nbsp;Partnering with KPMG Austria, KNAPP implemented SAP Sustainability Footprint Management and SAP Sustainability Control Tower to replace manual reporting with automated, integrated processes. These solutions consolidated over 200 sustainability metrics from across the business, delivering advanced carbon footprint calculations at both product and corporate levels. This gave KNAPP unprecedented visibility into emissions, resource use, and overall ESG impact.&amp;nbsp;With audit-ready reporting in place, KNAPP achieved CSRD compliance well ahead of schedule and embedded sustainability insights into daily operations and strategic planning. This proactive approach turned compliance into a catalyst for transformation, accelerating their “now4tomorrow” program and ensuring their first sustainability report complements financial disclosures.

Also facing growing demands for transparent ESG reporting under CSRD, Tyrolit needed to move beyond fragmented systems and spreadsheets that made standardization and auditability difficult.&amp;nbsp;To address this, Tyrolit deployed SAP Sustainability Footprint Management and SAP Sustainability Control Tower, integrated via SAP Business Technology Platform. This centralized ESG data collection from SAP and third-party systems, aligned sustainability reporting with financial standards, and enabled advanced analytics for benchmarking and target setting.&amp;nbsp;AI-powered automation reduced manual work, improved accuracy, and provided dashboards for 60+ managers to monitor 80+ ESG metrics. This resulted in measurable carbon reductions, less plastic packaging, and higher recycling rates. Tyrolit now uses data-driven insights to identify emission-saving opportunities and embed sustainability across the organization.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi&lt;STRONG&gt; SCN Folks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hope you guys are doing great&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note 01: This blog does not include execution screenshots.&lt;BR /&gt;Note 02: The entire code was developed and validated in the SANDBOX system, with results meeting expectations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This post outlines a custom development approach in SAP Master Data Governance (MDG) to restrict the use of special characters in the Account Holder field. The validation logic is implemented using the enhancement framework via BADI: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;USMD_RULE_SERVICE, specifically through the method CHECK_ENTITY. This ensures data consistency and compliance with formatting standards during master data creation and change processes.&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisite: A working knowledge of BADI&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;CODE&gt;USMD_RULE_SERVICE and ABAP development is required to follow this implementation.&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Development Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Class:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;CODE&gt;ZMDGS_MSG_CLASS&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Number:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;CODE&gt;002&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Type:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;CODE&gt;E&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Text:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;CODE&gt;The Account Holder field must not contain any special characters&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BADI Method Implemented:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;CODE&gt;IF_EX_USMD_RULE_SERVICE~CHECK_ENTITY&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The validation logic is written directly in the method&amp;nbsp;CHECK_ENTITY&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;P&gt;This ensures that when the Account Holder field is entered, the system validates the content to ensure it does not contain any special characters, and raises a custom message if invalid characters are found&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Code:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt; METHOD if_ex_usmd_rule_service~check_entity.
