    <content>&lt;P&gt;End of 2022 we launched ABAP Cloud and published the new &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/10/52e0cd9b-497e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ABAP extensibility guide&lt;/A&gt;. This guide is the best starting point for overview of ABAP Cloud development model and ABAP-based extensibility options for SAP S/4HANA in the cloud and on-premise. The last update of the extensibility guide took place in May 2023 where we incorporated the feedback of early adaptors of ABAP Cloud in real SAP S/4HANA systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A key concept for extensibility in S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and on-premise outlined in the ABAP extensibility guide was the 3-tier extensibility model. This model described how ABAP Cloud and classic ABAP can co-exist within a single system: tier 1 contained ABAP Cloud on-stack extensions, as well as any developments with SAP Build on SAP BTP for side-by-side extensions. Tier 2 served to address gaps, providing mechanisms to mitigate necessary publicly released SAP APIs not yet available in tier 1. Finally, tier 3 encompassed classic ABAP extensions. Only tier 1 (and tier 2, when using recommended SAP objects) was considered as clean core. In contrast, tier 3 was classified as “not clean.” The ABAP test cockpit checks for ABAP Cloud readiness controlled the usage of classic ABAP in custom extensions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The main objective of the clean core dimension &lt;EM&gt;Extensibility&lt;/EM&gt; for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA on-premise deployments is decoupling of custom extensions from SAP standard via use of ABAP Cloud and reliable development and extension technologies to reach upgrade stability. On the way to clean core, dealing with the classic ABAP custom code represents a challenge for SAP customers and partners. Multiple customer and partner interactions showed that the binary classification of custom code in the 3-tier extensibility model in “clean core” and “not clean core” and governance based on&amp;nbsp;ABAP test cockpit checks for ABAP Cloud readiness were too restrictive and not applicable for systems with a lot of existing custom code developed with classic ABAP. Besides this there are also new custom extensions which need to be implemented with classic ABAP because for example the related SAP application area is not sufficiently covered by publicly released SAP APIs or is implemented with SAP GUI based technologies and frameworks. On the other hand, many of underlying SAP classic ABAP technologies, like ABAP List Viewer for example, incorporate an implementation stability which most likely will bring minimum upgrade risks and can be still utilized in classic ABAP developments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2024/09/20aece06-d87e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Clean core extensibility&lt;/A&gt; white paper introduced by SAP incorporates evolution of the current 3-tier extensibility model with binary decisions on clean core to more detailed assessment of classic ABAP extensions based on the clean core level concept, allowing you as SAP customers and partners stepwise transformation to clean core at your own pace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In a nutshell:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Level A&lt;/STRONG&gt; are the cleanest custom extensions built either on-stack with ABAP Cloud development model or side-by-side using any option of SAP Build on SAP BTP – ABAP Cloud, CAP or low-code/no-code tools&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Levels B-D relate to all classic ABAP developments and can be reached as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Level B&lt;/STRONG&gt; can be achieved by custom extensions that comply with SAP recommendations for the use of classic ABAP development technologies and the frameworks offered as classic SAP APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Level C&lt;/STRONG&gt; contains custom extensions which cannot be qualified for Level B because of usage of arbitrary SAP internal objects. Under the condition that dedicated checks are performed before the release upgrade (following the changelog for SAP objects approach), these custom extensions can be considered conditionally clean.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Level D&lt;/STRONG&gt; is not clean core and includes custom extensions with severe violations of SAP development recommendations like modifications, usage of not recommended SAP objects or extension technologies (e.g. implicit enhancements).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Following the new clean core extensibility guidance we have updated the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/10/52e0cd9b-497e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ABAP extensibility guide&lt;/A&gt; with technical guidelines which are in line and support the clean core level concept for the classification of custom extensions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1995137509"&gt;Summary of technical ABAP extensibility guidelines for clean core&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1798624004"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ext_guide_blog_pic.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298185i9FC44E2401DBDDF1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ext_guide_blog_pic.png" alt="ext_guide_blog_pic.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1602110499"&gt;How the ABAP test cockpit (ATC) supports clean core level concept&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="cc_levels_atc.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298186i515EB58FE4135D5B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="cc_levels_atc.png" alt="cc_levels_atc.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Main updates for transformation of 3-tier extensibility model to clean core extensibility based on clean core level concept&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;(see the activity log on page 1 of the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/10/52e0cd9b-497e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ABAP extensibility guide&lt;/A&gt; for details):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Change technical guidelines for extensibility from 3-tier model to ABAP Cloud development and classic ABAP development&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Explain classic SAP APIs and their matching to clean core levels&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Provide ABAP test cockpit (ATC) recommendations for governance of classic ABAP development for clean core&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Explain relation of custom code use cases to clean core levels&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Describe changelog for SAP objects approach for assessment of upgrade stability of custom code using SAP internal objects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Change transformation options for existing custom code from 3-tier extensibility model to ABAP Cloud and classic ABAP developments&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supporting the clean core extensibility and clean core level concept with these technical guidelines for ABAP extensibility is a next significant step forward to support your clean core transformation at your own speed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have already set up the 3-tier extensibility model and are following clean core development practices, you might be wondering if the new guidance changes everything. Good news — you are already on the right track! The new clean core level concept simply provides enhanced guidance for everything you developed in tier 3 with classic ABAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you now want to learn more about the refined clean core extensibility guidance and clean core levels, read the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2024/09/20aece06-d87e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Clean core extensibility&lt;/A&gt; whitepaper.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information about ABAP Cloud and recommendations for classic ABAP developments, classic APIs, ABAP test cockpit setup and behavior for governance of clean core development supporting the clean core levels switch directly to the updated &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/10/52e0cd9b-497e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ABAP extensibility guide&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, you can also use the updated &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/04/14c64bde-6d7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ABAP Cloud - Extensibility slide deck&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;.

    <title>GIS and SAP Integration – critical for Oil and Gas Companies</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dynamic alignment sheets facilitate the maintenance process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today’s blog focuses on the midstream segment of the oil and gas industry, where the transportation of oil and gas plays a critical role. Companies aim to optimize field asset management by maintaining accurate digital twins of pipelines and related assets. Traditionally, however, different business and IT systems are used to represent these assets: SAP systems manage financial and maintenance data, while GIS systems handle technical specifications and location intelligence. To streamline asset registration and improve efficiency, it is essential to eliminate duplicate data entry, which not only wastes time but also increases the risk of errors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;VertiGIS Integrator streamlines the asset registration process by enabling efficient synchronization between GIS and SAP systems. Assets can be initially created in SAP and synchronized to GIS, where only the geographical location and select technical attributes are recorded. Conversely, for assets where GIS serves as the primary system, the integration ensures these assets are seamlessly transferred to SAP after their creation in GIS. This bi-directional workflow enables a highly efficient and integrated asset registration process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With GIS and SAP now fully integrated, businesses can leverage map-centric workflows to enhance operational efficiency. A key example is in maintenance processes, particularly the creation of notifications. For instance, when a pipeline malfunction, such as corrosion, is identified in the field, it is essential to pinpoint the exact location along the pipeline for accurate notification placement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditionally, oil and gas companies have relied on alignment sheets to document various properties or events along linear assets using linear references, such as meters or kilometers. VertiGIS has modernized this process with its VertiGIS Inline software module, bringing alignment sheets into the digital era. This module allows users to dynamically analyze pipeline-related data through a combination of standard maps and linear-referenced properties displayed below the pipeline. Using VertiGIS Studio Workflow technology, user actions can be configured through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. This enables end users to create SAP notifications at specific linear reference points (e.g., kilometer 3.2) or precise map coordinates (X, Y). This map-centric approach simplifies and improves the user experience for creating SAP notifications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="VertiGIS-Inline-SAP.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299872i95A2A16FC968B0A6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="VertiGIS-Inline-SAP.jpg" alt="VertiGIS-Inline-SAP.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The interface displays the pipeline on a map, with a dynamic alignment sheet below. Users can efficiently create SAP notifications or other custom events at specific points, such as kilometer 3.2&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, VertiGIS supports map-centric mobile workflows that integrate SAP and GIS systems. Field workers can use mobile applications, such as VertiGIS Studio Mobile, to create notifications or manage work orders directly in the field. These notifications are then automatically synced with the SAP system in near real-time, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information across business systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have any questions or would like to find out more, please contact me at&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florianbrandidohrn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/florianbrandidohrn/&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;or &lt;A href="mailto:florian.brandi-dohrn@vertigis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;florian.brandi-dohrn@vertigis.com&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;A big part of the magic behind AI, advanced analytics, and {insert tech buzzword here} is the humble API!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I remember the excitement about service-oriented architecture in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Back when most organisations had 'fat' ERPs with extensive customisation, the idea that we could split things up into different apps and connect in a standardised way was refreshing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I recently noticed a &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/sap-codejam-connecting-systems-and-services-using-sap-integration-suite/ec-p/14110686#M848" target="_self"&gt;SAP CodeJam&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the SAP community events calendar that involved connecting systems to S/4HANA using SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I thought it might be fun to build a web app and see if I could successfully connect it to S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A basic understanding of frontend to enterprise backend via cloud architecture is useful for everyone; business experts, technology experts, and people experts&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The article is broken into three parts: an introduction, a step-by-step explanation for generalists, and my build/test notes for anyone working on something similar. The third section includes details on all the test tools, and configuration settings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A couple of quick disclaimers:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I'm not an integration expert:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I don't look at integration suite vs. other solutions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I don't cover best practices, typical challenges, good use cases&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;My solution here is likely not optimal:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It's just a vanilla HTML, CSS, JS frontend&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;---&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1608011118"&gt;Part 1: introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1540580332"&gt;From web app to S/4HANA&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300221i6AE07F957A2E6A24/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-1.png" alt="integration-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The plan:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The frontend is a web page to search for data from within S/4HANA&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The web server handles communication between the frontend and SAP Cloud&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Integration Suite will route and format the message for S/4HANA&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;S/4HANA is the source of data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tools/technology:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Utilise the free trial account for SAP BTP and Integration Suite&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Build the frontend and web app ourselves&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We can't access S/4HANA. However, the CodeJam provides a S/4HANA mock server that mimics the behaviour of an API within S/4HANA.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If we use a mock system, we will need to run it locally. So, adjusting the architecture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300223iF83EF9D1F958295D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-2.png" alt="integration-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This adds SAP Cloud Connector which allows an "on-premise" application to connect with SAP Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1344066827"&gt;The front end&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The completed app offers a summary view and a detailed view. Here's a short &lt;A href="https://youtu.be/wNgAwEfLyX0" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;screen recording&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1276636041"&gt;Summary view&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a screenshot from the web browser (firefox).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-3.png" style="width: 986px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300227i15B2BBB969C15471/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-3.png" alt="integration-3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The top part of the page has a search form that allows you to search for a business partner. The bottom part of the page shows the results with a selection of key fields in a card style layout.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock system we are using allows for four different search possibilities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search for a single business partner by number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search for all business partners&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search for a single business partner by number, including address details&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search for all business partners, including address details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1080122536"&gt;Detail view&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300230iFE51F5F8AD6D02A5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-4.png" alt="integration-4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The detail view shows the results in a table. This table has a horizontal scroll bar, which can be adjusted to view all the fields. The table includes 'raw' results, so there are some 'technical' entries like `[object Object]` and some blanks, which I think is fine for this mock up stage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-883609031"&gt;Responsive view&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;For tablets and mobile, the card view resizes with the browser window.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;![the front end - summary view on mobile](/assets/images/blog/integration/integration-5.png)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-5.png" style="width: 364px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300231i01B740227C1E13DC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-5.png" alt="Integration-5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'll come back to how this front end was built after running through the integration flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-558012807"&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The value of this flow is being able to design and build a frontend to access real-time, trusted business data from S/4HANA in a standardised way. In a real-world example, our frontend could be an employee portal or supplier portal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;S/4HANA is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP's enterprise software for large organisations. It handles processes such as purchasing, manufacturing, sales, shipping, finance, etc.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;An evolution from their earlier ERP products (R/1, R/2, R/3, ECC).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A complex platform comprising thousands of programs, tables, and customisations used by many large enterprises.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;S/4HANA already comes with a web frontend called Fiori, which includes thousands of apps. However, in this example imagine we are building something for a casual user that does not require the full capability of Fiori. Or, just consider it's for fun.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further reading on S/4HANA:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[SAP help - S/4HANA](&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE?locale=en-US&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-361499302"&gt;Business partner&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock server simulates one of the business partner APIs for S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A business partner is a reference or master data record that represents a third party that an organisation works with. This includes customers, suppliers, and employees.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business partner master data is organised by key fields such as "category" and "role".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300232iDF2DB3D934F8EECC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-6.png" alt="Integration-6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All business partners have general data such as name, address, etc., then they have role-specific data, which may include, but are not limited to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Purchasing data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sales data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accounting data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And so on.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To understand how business partner data is used, consider a typical ERP process like order-to-cash:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-7.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300233i882EADCDD4912385/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-7.png" alt="Integration-7.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a summary of the order to cash process. During sales, deliveries, and billing, information from the business partner master record is utilised.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The business partner master stores long-term stable information about the customer. It's used for both reference and validation during transaction entry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This ensures there is consistency across transactions over time in terms of how they reference business partners. This is critical for reporting. Consider comparability, aggregation, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further reading on business partners:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/74b0b157c81944ffaac6ebc07245b9dc/45653b5856de0846e10000000a441470.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Help - Business Partner&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-164985797"&gt;S/4HANA Architecture&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock server simulates an S/4HANA API. Let's look inside S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-8.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300236i8B0B2CC5994D164A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-8.png" alt="Integration-8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Starting from the top right, S/4HANA has two primary ways for users to interact. The traditional SAP graphical user interface (GUI) and the modern Fiori web-based user interface.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've drawn APIs to the left of these. The APIs allow applications to interact with S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consider the data model in S/4HANA in two separate parts. The first is the traditional HANA database. This is where master data and transactional data are stored. On top of this is the virtual data model. This consists of core data services views. This is a way to define different sets of data to meet the needs of APIs and Fiori Apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this example, we are using a business partner data API. Behind the scenes, the API sources data from CDS views, which in turn connect to the HANA DB tables.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;---&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--160610427"&gt;Part 2: step by step walkthrough (for everyone)&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this section, I'll summarise the process and technology involved at each step.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-119213144"&gt;Point 1: Web communication&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-map-1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300239i27A3BC33FE94D8D7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-map-1.png" alt="integration-map-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Building an integration flow between web connected applications relies on protocols and standards for web communication. Let's run through the main concepts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--370703368"&gt;Client/server&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The terms client and server are used to describe the requester and receiver. For example, the web browser on a computer is a client, and google search is a server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Internet communications use the HTTP protocol.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;![HTTP communication](/assets/images/blog/integration/integration-10.png)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a standard protocol for communication between clients and web servers. Web pages are written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The term Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to describe an address.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--567216873"&gt;The structure of a URL&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;URLs have five key parts:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Protocol: `http://`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Domain: `&lt;A href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;www.example.com&lt;/A&gt;`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Path: `/pages/`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Query string: `?id=1&amp;amp;cat=test`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fragment: `#article` (an internal page reference, often not present)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;When it comes to APIs, the query string provides the ability to specify parameters for search and filter. In this case, the query string could include a business partner number.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--763730378"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;HTTPS uses the HTTP protocol, but it adds a secure transport layer. HTTPS means the HTTP message is encrypted before transmission.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The only part that isn't encrypted is the domain name.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--960243883"&gt;Internet protocol (IP) address&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;While URLs are designed to be human-readable. An IP is a numerical label like "192.0.2.1" that identifies a computer or network.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;URLs are used for navigation. IPs are used for routing and communication. They identify a specific device on a network (laptop, server, etc.).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An IP address can be used in place of a domain name with HTTP and HTTPS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://192.0.2.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://192.0.2.1&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While an IP address represents a computer. The term "port" is used to specific a specific input/output location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ports are identified using 4 digits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"http://{server}:{port}"&lt;BR /&gt;"&lt;A href="http://192.0.2.1:1000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://192.0.2.1:1000&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A server is often referred to by 'host'&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"http://{host}:{port}"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can access ports on your own computer by using its IP or "localhost"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:1000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:1000&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1156757388"&gt;From domain to IP&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The web browser uses a domain lookup service to translate a URL into an IP address.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.example.com&lt;/A&gt;" becomes "&lt;A href="http://192.0.2.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://192.0.2.1&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is called the Domain Name System (DNS). Popular look up services include: Cloudflare, Google DNS, and OpenDNS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1353270893"&gt;Messages&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The communications themselves can be thought of as messages. They contain a header and a body.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The header includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The URL&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The method, most commonly GET and POST&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GET sends a request without a body&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;POST sends a request with a body&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additional information on the content type and authorisation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The body includes detailed content. For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you fill in a form on a web page, it would include the form data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If a server returns a web page, it would include the web page.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1549784398"&gt;Server Responses&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;When a server receives a request, it responds with a status code and a body. Status codes include '200' representing "ok" and '404' representing 'Not Found'.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;(404 has definitely reached meme levels of fame!).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The body that's returned depends on the status and the server's purpose.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1746297903"&gt;Real life examples&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consider visiting the BBC website from a web browser, a simple GET request would return the home page.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-10-1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300240i98D1E11DB146673D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-10-1.png" alt="Integration-10-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the other hand, consider logging into the BBC website. In this case, the browser sends the login name and password. Therefore, a POST request is used, and the request includes a body.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-10-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300241i9C9D28EC27350605/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-10-2.png" alt="Integration-10-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1942811408"&gt;Web connectivity and SAP&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most SAP applications can use HTTPS communication. This is possibly one of the simplest ways we could define "Cloud" strategy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;S/4HANA Cloud Public and S/4HANA Cloud Private can both utilise HTTPS&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP BTP which includes SAP Integration Suite can utilise HTTPS&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Outside the SAP Cloud, we have systems like S/4HANA On-Premise. This is usually at an SAP customer's data centre or their 3rd party hosting service provider's data centre. On premise systems are usually not directly connected to the public internet. This is where SAP provide Cloud Connector to create a secure tunnel between on-premise and SAP Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1971141222"&gt;HTTP data transfer standards&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are further standards as to how data is transferred using HTTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are multiple standards for data transfer with HTTP. One of the earlier and more common standards is REST (Representational State Transfer).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many SAP APIs utilise OData (Open data transfer protocol).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1874251720"&gt;Point 2: S/4HANA business partner API mock server&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-map-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300244i0C0E251EDEC4B8A1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-map-2.png" alt="Integration-map-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mimic the business partner API of an S/4HANA system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is it:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A simple JavaScript server that can be run locally.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock server provided by the SAP community provides a simple way to simulate the design and test of an S/4HANA API.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The mock server mimics the business partner (A2X) API&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This is one of the S/4HANA APIs (programmed inside S/4HANA)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the case of the mock server, it's a JavaScript server&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The mock server has limited functionality, it supports:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sample data for a few business partners&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retrieve all business partners&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retrieve a single business partner&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Include additional address data in the response.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Installing and running the mock server is simple. The instructions are in part 3. When we run it our computer a local address is returned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On my computer, it runs on "&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the address for the Business Partner API. Entering this address in the web browser gives the following response:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-10-3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300247i85F8DBD3A3C0907C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-10-3.png" alt="Integration-10-3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first item refers to the business partner API. This is the first point in the exercise where we can see the path for the Business Partner API:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The API path is just appended to the host, so:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clicking on the link in the browser shows additional information about the API.

It's a central repository for APIs from SAP &amp;amp; selected partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;api.sap.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Main features&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Discover, explore, and test APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Consume integration and workflow content&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Business Partner (A2X) API that is tested here can be viewed on Business Accelerator Hub.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Login to business accelerator hub&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search 'business partner (A2X)'&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click on the entry in the results&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-12.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300265iA01898E1E22775A1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-12.png" alt="integration-12.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some features of business accelerator hub:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Try out the APIs (sandbox environment)&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Useful to view a sample of the response&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;View the API capabilities:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;'API Reference' tab, scroll down to 'Business Partner' and click on it&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This shows the list of capabilities of the API&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;View the API specification&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;'Overview' tab, scroll down to 'API Specification' and click on it&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Download OpenAPI JSON&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;View in web browser, text editor to see extensive details&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The API hub is a useful resource in terms of discovering and designing potential API use.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the mock server specification, we know it's limited to only a few capabilities. We can find the path names for each of these on API hub:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-12-1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300267iB9991B6EA91D1FC9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-12-1.png" alt="Integration-12-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This confirms the mock server only has a small fraction of the full business partner (A2X) capabilities. This makes sense given how extensive business partner data is in SAP. It's noteworthy that the mock server only supports 'read' activities. We can't test creating or changing a business partner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The details of each of these requests can be viewed by clicking into them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While there are three request paths. The address path can be added to the "all business partners" or "single business partner", so there are four possibilities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All business partners&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"/A_BusinessPartner"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All business partners with address&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"/A_BusinessPartner/to_BusinessPartnerAddress"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Single business partner&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"/A_BusinessPartner('{BusinessPartner}')"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Single business partner with address&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"/A_BusinessPartner('{BusinessPartner}')/to_BusinessPartnerAddress"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These paths describe services of the API and are appended to the base URL.For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner('{BusinessPartner}')/to_BusinessPartnerAddress" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner('{BusinessPartner}')/to_BusinessPartnerAddress&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The correct terminology for these URLs:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Base URL/host: &lt;A href="http://localhost:3005" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Base path: /sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Entity set: /A_BusinessPartner&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Key Access: ('1234567')&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigation property: /to_BusinessPartnerAddress&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;"('{business partner}')" in the example is a placeholder for a business partner number.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Updating the flow diagram with these details:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-12-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300270i7171352709F09CC3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-12-2.png" alt="Integration-12-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1438148051"&gt;Point 6: SAP Integration Suite&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-map-6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300271i8FBBDE02F7A3CF64/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-map-6.png" alt="Integration-map-6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Design and manage communications between applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is it:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A service of SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Suite is one of the services available in Business Technology Platform. Therefore, a prerequisite is to register for the BTP free trial.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Suite can then be found under 'Services Marketplace'.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Intelligent suite can be used for Cloud, on-premise, and hybrid scenarios. It includes pre-built, best-practice integration packs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technically, it's a Java based app, and utilises the Apache Camel framework.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-13.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300274iC625747A413A6229/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-13.png" alt="Integration-13.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The steps to install and set up are covered in part 3.

However, in some scenarios sender systems may be inflexible or difficult to develop on, making these transformation capabilities in Integration Suite important.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further reading on SAP Integration Suite:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/what-is-sap-integration-suite?locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Help - What is integration suite&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;- &lt;A href="https://camel.apache.org/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Apache Camel&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-427250712"&gt;Point 7.

The S/4HANA business partner mock server is a JavaScript server that runs locally on desktop/laptop and is hence considered 'on-premise' or outside the SAP Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP provides "SAP Cloud Connector" to connect on-premise applications to the SAP Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's a JavaScript application that can be installed and run locally. Part of the set-up involves entering authentication details from BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After it's set-up, Cloud Connector will accept messages from Integration Suite and forward them to the S/4HANA business partner mock server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The detailed set-up is covered in part 3.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-16.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300295i06526E809FBCA319/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-16.png" alt="Integration-16.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The screenshot above shows the "Cloud to On-Premise" mapping. A virtual host "s4-mock:3006" is mapped to the S4/HANA business partner mock server running locally on "localhost:3005".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Updating the integration flow:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-16-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300296i574EC1489A20E013/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-16-2.png" alt="Integration-16-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-230737207"&gt;Point 8: Web app&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-map-8.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300297i052F2A545DBA8042/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-map-8.png" alt="Integration-map-8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The web app is an application that uses JavaScript as a programming language. Web browsers have JavaScript engines and can run JavaScript code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are two parts to the web app. The frontend and the backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of JavaScript in two categories. frontend JavaScript and server (backend) JavaScript.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--259179305"&gt;Frontend JavaScript&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Runs in the web browser, utilising the browsers JavaScript engine&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is oriented towards manipulating web documents (HTML documents), for example:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retrieve fields from HTML (e.g. sign up form)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Update HTML (e.g. show results, dynamically add a new page)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The JavaScript engine in the browser has limitations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--455692810"&gt;Server JavaScript&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Installed on a server (can also be run on a desktop/laptop)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A popular engine is Node.js&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is oriented towards messaging, connectivity, security, authentication&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Has a lot less limitations than the web browser.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;We could try to send a request from the frontend to SAP Integration Suite, but because it comes from a browser, it will likely result in errors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I did try sending a message to Integration Suite from the browser, but received various CORS errors. CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a browser security feature that controls whether a web page on one domain can access resources from a different domain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, the frontend will send a request to the backend, which will then prepare the message and send it as a request to SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's look at the frontend first, then the backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--358803308"&gt;Point 8.1 Web app: frontend&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Search for and display business partner details on a web page.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is it:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A simple web app based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The frontend can be built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;HTML: Used to define the content of the web page&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CSS: Used to apply styles to the web page (layout, colours, font, etc.)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Javascript&amp;amp;colon; Use for programming logic, for example:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get input field values from HTML&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fetch data from the server&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Restructure data for display&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are written in their own files. They are typically in the same folder.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```&lt;BR /&gt;frontend/&lt;BR /&gt;├── index.html&lt;BR /&gt;├── styles.css&lt;BR /&gt;└── script.js&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The HTML file includes references to the 'styles.css' and 'script.js' documents. These can all be written in simple text editors, but applications like 'visual studio code' help with syntax highlighting and formatting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For demo/test these files can simply be kept on a computers hard drive. Or they could be hosted on a static web server like Netlify or GitHub pages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--555316813"&gt;Point 8.2: Web app - HTML&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Web pages are written with HTML, they are hierarchically structured documents where 'tags' are used to denote different types of element which contain content.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a simple illustration, the following would create a web page with a title, a text input field, a submit button and a space for results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;

  &amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;

    // Results go here

&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This would display:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-17.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300300i9BF0AF4B0E0552B9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-17.png" alt="Integration-17.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A simple element such as paragraph is denoted by&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;`&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;enter paragraph&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A more complex element, an input field is denoted by&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;`&amp;lt;input type="text" /&amp;gt;`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In this case, `type` is an attribute set to `text` for text field&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1045233325"&gt;Getting HTML to talk to CSS and JavaScript**&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are two attributes that allow them to work together:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"id": for example id="bp-input" (where bp-input is a variable name)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"class": for example class="bp-input" (where bp-input is a variable name)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These attributes can be added to HTML elements to allow us to access those elements with CSS and JavaScript. The difference between the two is a single "id" value is unique and should only be used once in an HTML document, while a class can be applied to multiple HTML elements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The body of the web app frontend is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;header class="header"&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's not very complex. Most of the complexity is in the CSS styling and the JavaScript programming to return the results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This segregation of content (HTML), styles (CSS), and programming logic (JS) makes working with frontend well structured.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The web app initial HTML includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A header bar with the logo, page name and home link&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A search section with search field options&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;BP number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Checkbox to get address&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Checkbox to show results in detail view&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is how this looks without styling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-18.png" style="width: 824px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300306i6242F0F51B915194/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-18.png" alt="integration-18.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The version with styling was shown at the start of the article.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is the &lt;A href="https://alexroan.com/assets/documents/integration/frontend-html" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;HTML file&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--948343823"&gt;Point 8.3: Web app - CSS&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cascading style sheets (CSS) are used to apply styles to HTML documents. Consider an HTML document with three lines of text:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p id="line-one"&amp;gt;This is text line one&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class="other-lines"&amp;gt;This is text line two&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class="other-lines"&amp;gt;This is text line three&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;These can be styled with CSS as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#line-one {
color: red;
font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.other-lines {
color: blue;
text-decoration: underline;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This would show:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-19.png" style="width: 472px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300316iF0420D2F7368485B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-19.png" alt="Integration-19.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The complete CSS for the demo/test web app is lengthy. Around 200 lines. Here is a snippet to get an idea of what it looks like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-20.png" style="width: 822px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300317i8B8CC471FF9421E6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-20.png" alt="integration-20.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CSS is easy to pick up, but challenging to master!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking at the class "bp-search". This applies to the area of the HTML document where the search fields are collected. The CSS here does things like orient those search fields in a column "flex-direction:column" and apply a border and a shadow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is how our page looks with styling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-21.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300318i0AF0854FE34C5F34/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-21.png" alt="Integration-21.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Here is the full &lt;A href="https://alexroan.com/asssets/documents/integration/frontend-css.css" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;CSS file&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--976673637"&gt;Point 8.4: Web app - JavaScript&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Frontend JavaScript is able to retrieve, edit and add elements to the HTML document. Writing the JavaScript is possibly the most challenging part of this demo/test, so I'll just summarise what the code does:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Listen for a click of the 'submit' button&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get the value of the form input elements&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Business partner number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The status of the 'include address details' checkbox&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The status of the 'show results in table' checkbox&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Check the business partner value is valid&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It has to be blank or a 7-digit number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a variable object called 'request' to track the request type&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The variable includes:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;request URL&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;request method&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;request body&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;(The ability to track multiple values in an Object is a key JS feature)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Based on the input fields, identify the request type &amp;amp; update the 'request' object.&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The combinations are:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If bp number is blank and get address isn't checked&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If bp number is blank and get address is checked&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If bp number is entered and get address isn't checked&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If bp number is entered and get address is checked.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;At this point, the request object will store a set of values based on the input selections. The values will be one of the four options listed in the earlier tables.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The JavaScript now has what it needs to send a request to SAP Integration Suite. The rest of the JavaScript handles various things:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use the JavaScript method 'fetch()' to send requests to the server&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Handle security and authorisation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Getting a token if needed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sending a token with requests&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Handling errors&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If successful, capturing the returned data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Working through the returned data and updating the HTML&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creating cards for the summary view&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creating a table for the detailed view&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is the &lt;A href="https://alexroan.com/assets/documents/integration/frontend-javascript.js" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;JavaScript.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1173187142"&gt;Point 9. Web app: backend server&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-map-9.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300319i957338C0D7C637CE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-map-9.png" alt="Integration-map-9.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Allow a web frontend to communicate with SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is it:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;A JavaScript web backend server for message formatting and routing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The backend server is locally hosted on our computer for this test/demo, but in reality would be on a web server somewhere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's written in express, which is a framework on Node.js. It's quite different from frontend JavaScript.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The logic of the backend is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Listen for communication from the frontend&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If a message is received:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do some manipulation of the message related to authorisations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Using fetch() try sending a request to SAP Integration Suite&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;More authorisation/security handling&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If successful, return the response back to the browser&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If unsuccessful, log and return the error.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is the backend &lt;A href="https://alexroan.com/assets/documents/integration/backend-javascript.js" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;JavaScript code&lt;/A&gt;. This needs to be set up as part of a Node.js server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The JavaScript server is a bit more complex than the frontend. The server folder contains:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```&lt;BR /&gt;web-app-server/&lt;BR /&gt;├── node_modules/ # created by npm install&lt;BR /&gt;├── package-lock.json # created/updated by npm install&lt;BR /&gt;├── package.json # you write this (or generate with `npm init`)&lt;BR /&gt;└── server.js # your server code&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;server.js contains the actual JavaScript code for the server.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;package.json defines project settings, dependencies, and scripts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;node_modules/ and package-lock.json are automatically generated when dependencies are installed using npm install.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The port can be specified in 'server.js'. I choose port 5000.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This means the server will run on '&lt;A href="http://localhost:5000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:5000&lt;/A&gt;'.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-24.png" style="width: 650px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300322i6AC5E5AE7259389E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-24.png" alt="Integration-24.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After writing package.json and server.js, the following steps are required in terminal to initialise the server, install express, and then start the server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;cd web-app-server&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;npm init -y&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;npm install express&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;node server.js&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can now update the flow diagram with the details for the frontend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-25.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300323iD986EC04D7C226DD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-25.png" alt="Integration-25.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1369700647"&gt;One flow, many messages&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking at the diagram, a click on the search button triggers a message that passes through four stages:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From the frontend (browser) to the backend web server&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From the web server to SAP Integration Suite&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From Integration Suite to Cloud Connector&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From Cloud Connector to the S/4HANA system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;JavaScript doesn’t normally “wait” for things to happen — it’s designed to keep running while other operations (like network requests) complete in the background.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, the fetch() function is asynchronous, which means it starts a request and immediately returns a kind of “promise” — a placeholder that will eventually be resolved when the response comes back (or if it fails).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When testing this flow, there are multiple layers where errors can occur:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The browser console (frontend logs)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The backend server console (Node.js logs)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integration Suite’s monitoring tools&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The message can fail at any step, and it sometimes takes a bit of detective work to figure out where it failed and why.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If everything works, and S/4HANA returns a successful response (status code 200), that response flows automatically back through the same chain — each layer staying in a “waiting” state until the result is passed back to the frontend and displayed to the user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Don't worry if it's not 100% clear, it took me a while to figure this out.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1566214152"&gt;Conclusions to the walkthrough&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's really fun to build your own frontend and connect it to a real enterprise grade system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A few important considerations:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Precision is needed with the integration configuration:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Host names, types, routing, transformation are all sensitive to mistakes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The JavaScript is a little complex, but it is all well established&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A JavaScript and Node.js course and some googling could enable anyone to create this.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Using the S/4HANA business partner mock server is a quick and fun way to test out a potential integration with S/4HANA. However, it is just a mock server with limited features and a build and test with a real S/4HANA system would be required.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, it's easily achievable with a little study and practice and it opens the possibility to develop a wide range of things.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The APIs brings together:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Real-time fast access to a wide range of business data thanks to S/4HANA.&lt;BR /&gt;Extreme flexibility on the frontend side thanks to modern HTML, CSS and JS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This integration could have been much simpler by just having the frontend deliver a URL in the format required for the API. We don't really need the complexity of Integration Suite for this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;---&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1469324650"&gt;Part 3: building the integration flow (for IT people)&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this section I'll share my rough notes from the process of building this front end and integration flow.

Another option is to run it inside a container.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Containers are a key concept in Cloud architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A container packages an app and all it's dependencies together so that it can run independently of the underlying computer (server, laptop, etc.).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a key concept for Cloud as it allows applications to run on different hardware and operating systems with minimal set up effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Docker is a platform to build and manage containers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Docker and container features:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Package an app and all it's dependencies&lt;BR /&gt;- A container is like a lightweight virtual machine&lt;BR /&gt;- Key terms&lt;BR /&gt;- image: blueprint (.zip) containing app, dependencies, and OS&lt;BR /&gt;- container: running instance of an image&lt;BR /&gt;- dockerfile: instructions to build image&lt;BR /&gt;- volume: how to persist data outside the container&lt;BR /&gt;- port mapping: expose internal port to machine (e.g. 8080 to 3001).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'll come back to this in the section on running the BP mock server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1452782612"&gt;Data basics&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following data standards/formats are used in this exercise:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- A lightweight, human-readable format for storing and sharing structured data&lt;BR /&gt;- Looks like nested key-value pairs (like a shopping list with categories)&lt;BR /&gt;- Commonly used in web apps and APIs for sending data between systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```JSON&lt;BR /&gt;{&lt;BR /&gt;"employee_id": "1234567",&lt;BR /&gt;"employee_name": "Alexander"&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;XPATH&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- A query language used to navigate and extract data from XML or HTML documents&lt;BR /&gt;- Lets you point to specific elements using a path-like syntax&lt;BR /&gt;- Example: find the third paragraph inside a section&lt;BR /&gt;- Used in tools like web scrapers and automation scripts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```XPATH&lt;BR /&gt;//title[contains(text(), 'Programming')]&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;XML (eXtensible Markup Language)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- A flexible, tag-based format for representing structured data&lt;BR /&gt;- Similar to HTML in appearance&lt;BR /&gt;- But used for data storage and exchange, not page display.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```XML&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;lt;book id="bk01"&amp;gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;lt;author&amp;gt;Roan, Alexander&amp;lt;/author&amp;gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Front end to S/4HANA&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HTML (HyperText Markup Language)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- The standard language for building web pages and displaying content in browsers&lt;BR /&gt;- Uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images&lt;BR /&gt;- Focused on structure and layout, not data exchange.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1256269107"&gt;Terminal&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;I worked through this demo/test on Mac so I used Terminal, which is the Mac default command line interface (CLI).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The CLI is necessary for activities such as setting up and starting servers or working with docker containers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Terminal basics&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Open a folder `cd &amp;lt;folder name&amp;gt;` (change directory)&lt;BR /&gt;- `cd` on it's own will go to the home directory&lt;BR /&gt;- (Note that `~` represents home directory in terminal)&lt;BR /&gt;- `cd ..` will go up a folder&lt;BR /&gt;- List folders `ls` (list files in the current directory)&lt;BR /&gt;- Open a file `open &amp;lt;file name&amp;gt;` (open a file)&lt;BR /&gt;- Quit sub-screen and return to terminal `q`&lt;BR /&gt;- Stop a running process hold control and c&lt;BR /&gt;- Clear terminal `clear`&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To run JavaScript servers, JavaScript runtime is required. It's easier to install and manage things like this using a package manager in Terminal. Homebrew is a popular package manager for Mac.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Homebrew&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- A package manager for Mac&lt;BR /&gt;- To install homebrew homebrew:&lt;BR /&gt;- Launch terminal (launchpad &amp;gt; other &amp;gt; terminal)&lt;BR /&gt;- Visit [Homebrew](&lt;A href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://brew.sh/&lt;/A&gt;) in your web browser&lt;BR /&gt;- Copy the installation command&lt;BR /&gt;- Paste it into terminal press enter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1227939293"&gt;Java/JavaScript&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To complete the demo/test a few different JavaScript things are needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Node.js&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- This is a JavaScript that can be installed locally to create and run web-servers and web applications&lt;BR /&gt;- Install using Homebrew&lt;BR /&gt;- In terminal, enter: `brew install node`&lt;BR /&gt;- Test the installation of Node.js&lt;BR /&gt;- In terminal, enter: `node -v`, it should return the node version number.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;NPM&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- NPM is the node package manager&lt;BR /&gt;- It's installed with Node.js&lt;BR /&gt;- It's used to run a server&lt;BR /&gt;- Install it in any directory a Node.js server sits in&lt;BR /&gt;- To check the installation of NPM&lt;BR /&gt;- In terminal, enter: `npm -v`, it should return the npm version number&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Java development kit (JDK)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Cloud Connector is a more complex application and requires JDK&lt;BR /&gt;- More notes in the Cloud Connector section.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1031425788"&gt;API client (Bruno/Postman)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The CodeJam utilised [Bruno](&lt;A href="https://www.usebruno.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.usebruno.com/&lt;/A&gt;) for API testing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the CodeJam a folder of pre-configured settings for Bruno is provided. However I'd suggest to start experimenting without the pre-configuration to build a solid understanding of the basics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'll include more notes in later sections.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1128315290"&gt;Building and testing an integration flow&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-638398778"&gt;Set up the S/4HANA business partner mock server&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Start by setting up the S/4HANA business partner mock server&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Download the mock server from [GitHub](&lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-archive/cloud-s4-sdk-book/tree/mock-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://github.com/SAP-archive/cloud-s4-sdk-book/tree/mock-server&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;BR /&gt;- Scroll down to the readme&lt;BR /&gt;- Either download the archive linked under 'How to run this server'&lt;BR /&gt;- Or if using GitHub clone the repository and checked the branch 'mock-server'&lt;BR /&gt;- Move it to a convenient folder of your choice&lt;BR /&gt;- I set it a `users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/projects/integration/cloud-s4-sdk-book`&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-441885273"&gt;Run the server: option 1: use NPM&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Node.js and the node package manager (NPM) can be used to run the server directly on a computer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Open terminal&lt;BR /&gt;- Navigate to `users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/projects/integration/cloud-s4-sdk-book`&lt;BR /&gt;- (or wherever you saved the folder)&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter: `npm install` (install node package manager in the folder)&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter: `npm start` (start the server)&lt;BR /&gt;- This should return something like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```shell&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;gt; bupa-mock-odata@1.0.0 start&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;gt; node server.js&lt;BR /&gt;Mock server started on port 3000 after 1 ms, running - stop with CTRL+C (or CMD+C)...&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Terminal tells us which port the server is running on. Port "3000" is accesible in the browser or an API client via "&lt;A href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/A&gt;".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To stop the server in terminal use `ctrl+c`.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the curious, you can look at the files that make up the mock server in the above folder. Check out:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- server.js&lt;BR /&gt;- This includes the JavaScript code for the server&lt;BR /&gt;- The code references other files such as app.js&lt;BR /&gt;- package.json&lt;BR /&gt;- This is like a configuration file for a node.js server&lt;BR /&gt;- business partner &amp;gt; business-partner-data.json&lt;BR /&gt;- This contains the demo test business partner data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Theoretically you could use this Node.js server as a template to simulate other SAP Odata APIs with some adjustments to these files.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-245371768"&gt;Run the server: option 2: use Docker&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock server can also be run as a Docker container. This is a little more convenient as after the first run we can stop and start it from the Docker desktop app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note the server already has a Dockerfile, so it's already set up to run as a container.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If we run something inside a docker container we need to interact with it via ports on the container. The application is really running contained inside a container. When we run a docker container we provide a mapping between a local port on the computer and the container port. We can then access the docker application via this mapping.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To run as a Docker container:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Launch the docker app&lt;BR /&gt;- Open terminal&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter `docker run -p 3005:8080 bp-mock-server`&lt;BR /&gt;- 3005 is the local port&lt;BR /&gt;- 8080 is the docker container port&lt;BR /&gt;- Local port can be any free port on your computer. I choose 3005&lt;BR /&gt;- The container port is 8080&lt;BR /&gt;- View the status of the container in the Docker app&lt;BR /&gt;- Use the browser to check `http//localhost:3005`&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note if there wasn't already a dockerfile we would need to create one and build the app before running it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;**A simple docker demo**&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This was my first time using docker, so I experimented by creating a simple "Hello, World!" style server from scratch. Here it is if you want to try:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Create a JS file "index.js"&lt;BR /&gt;- Add `console.log("hello from docker");`&lt;BR /&gt;- This just prints text to the console (Terminal)&lt;BR /&gt;- Create a package file "package.json"&lt;BR /&gt;- Add the following JSON to "package.json"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```json&lt;BR /&gt;{&lt;BR /&gt;"name": "hello-docker",&lt;BR /&gt;"version": "1.0.0",&lt;BR /&gt;"main": "index.js",&lt;BR /&gt;"scripts": {&lt;BR /&gt;"start": "node index.js"&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Create a dockerfile "dockerfile"&lt;BR /&gt;- Add the following to "dockerfile"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```Dockerfile&lt;BR /&gt;FROM node:18&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;WORKDIR /usr/src/app&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;COPY package*.json ./&lt;BR /&gt;RUN npm install&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;COPY . .&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CMD ["npm", "start"]&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can see Docker uses NPM, in the same way we would with a manual run, but it's installing and running NPM inside the container, not on the computer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To build and run:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Build docker container `docker build -t hello-docker .`&lt;BR /&gt;- Run docker container `docker run hello-docker`&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-342261270"&gt;Testing with the web browser&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The simplest way to test the API is running locally is to put the local address in the web browser.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- For NPM it was "http//localhost:3000"&lt;BR /&gt;- For docker image it was "http//localhost:3005"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The main domain should return the API details including the links such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3000/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3000/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;BR /&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To access the service to return the general data of all business partners we add A_BusinessPartner&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the browser, this should return a JSON document containing the list of business partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can pick a business partner number from the list and use it with the path to select a specific business partner:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner('1003764" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner('1003764&lt;/A&gt;')"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-145747765"&gt;Testing with an API client (Bruno)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rather than just using the web browser to check the API an API client can be used, this has a few benefits:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- We can build the URLs through a selection of 'input fields'&lt;BR /&gt;- We can save different requests for easy and quick re-testing&lt;BR /&gt;- We can pass data in the request body&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To test with Bruno:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Launch Bruno&lt;BR /&gt;- Use the '...' menu to create a collection&lt;BR /&gt;- Name it 'bp-mock'&lt;BR /&gt;- Specify a location.

On this page the endpoint to access the service is shown:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"https://{your trial}-cpitrial03-rt.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.com/http/request-business-partners"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1844982598"&gt;Test Cloud Integration with API client&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;At this point we can test consuming the API through SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unlike testing the local mock server, we need to deal with authentication and security. The way this works is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- We pass a "client id" and "secret" to a "token URL"&lt;BR /&gt;- BTP passes back a "token" which is valid for a certain period of time&lt;BR /&gt;- This "token" has to be attached to any requests to the API in Intelligent Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accessing security details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Navigate to your BTP trial account&lt;BR /&gt;- Expand services and click on 'instances and subscriptions'&lt;BR /&gt;- Scroll down to instances and look for your integration flow instance&lt;BR /&gt;- Integration Suite uses Cloud Foundry so the runtime will be cloud foundry&lt;BR /&gt;- It will likely be named 'default_it-rt_integration-flow'&lt;BR /&gt;- Scroll down to service keys and click on the service key, note the values for:&lt;BR /&gt;- "clientid"&lt;BR /&gt;- "clientsecret"&lt;BR /&gt;- "url"&lt;BR /&gt;- "tokenurl"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For local testing we can hardcode these values in our test tools, but be careful not to upload or share these anywhere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In production, never hardcode secrets or tokens. Use environment variables or a secure credential store.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;**Request a token with Bruno**&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Bruno create a new request:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Name: `TOKEN`&lt;BR /&gt;- Method: `POST`&lt;BR /&gt;- URL: enter the "tokenurl" from above&lt;BR /&gt;- Navigate to the Params tab:&lt;BR /&gt;- Select 'Add Param'&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter name: `grant_type` path: `client_credentials`&lt;BR /&gt;- Navigate to Auth&lt;BR /&gt;- Switch 'Inherit' to 'Basic Auth' and enter:&lt;BR /&gt;- Username: `client_id`&lt;BR /&gt;- Password: `client_secret`&lt;BR /&gt;- Save&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Send the request. This should return a JSON document with a long value in "access_token". There should also be a expiry time e.g. 4199 seconds.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When sending a request, if the token is not valid Integration Suite will return a 401 error code. This means we need to request a new token.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Within Bruno we can save this token value to a variable. This saves us from copying and pasting it into other requests.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Goto Environments &amp;gt; Configure &amp;gt; Create Environment&lt;BR /&gt;- Name: 'integration-flow'&lt;BR /&gt;- Click '+ Add Variable'&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter name: 'access_token'&lt;BR /&gt;- For value, leave it blank&lt;BR /&gt;- Save and close&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Navigate to 'scripts' under the TOKEN request. Under Post Request enter:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```JS&lt;BR /&gt;if (res.status == 200) {&lt;BR /&gt;const token = res.body.access_token;&lt;BR /&gt;bru.setEnvVar("access_token",token);&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- If the request receives a response (status 200)&lt;BR /&gt;- Get the access_token value from the response&lt;BR /&gt;- Assign to environment variable "access_token".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Save and run the TOKEN request.&lt;BR /&gt;Goto the environment and click 'configure'. You should see the access_token variable updated with the value from the response.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;**Test the API with a request with for a single BP**&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- In Bruno create a new request&lt;BR /&gt;- Name: "BP via integration suite"&lt;BR /&gt;- URL: "https://{your-trial}.it-cpitrial03-rt.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.com/http/request-business-partners"&lt;BR /&gt;- Replace the above with your actual endpoint from Intelligent Suite.&lt;BR /&gt;- Navigate to the 'Auth' tab&lt;BR /&gt;- Click on 'Inherit' and change to 'Bearer Token'&lt;BR /&gt;- In Token enter: `{{access_token}}`&lt;BR /&gt;- This eferences an environment variable in Bruno&lt;BR /&gt;- Add the request body&lt;BR /&gt;- The JSON with our employee ID&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```JSON&lt;BR /&gt;{&lt;BR /&gt;"employee_id": "1003764"&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1454690089"&gt;Building and testing a frontend&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;At this point a request to SAP Integration Suite should be successfully routed and transformed to the S/4HANA business partner mock server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The next part would be building and testing the web app. However, there is too much to cover in building and testing the frontend to cover in this post. I may produce a video on this if anyone is interested.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1651203594"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This technology stack is definitely a bit overkill for a simple 'search' portal, but it is fairly easy to put together as long as you are careful when specifying paths, hosts and port names.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you'd like to discuss further please feel free to connect on &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderroan/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;LinkedIn - Alexander Roan&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Silent Storm of Non-Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s 7:15 AM and Priya Nair, Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) at a global pharmaceutical giant, receives a regulatory update from the European Medicines Agency. She sends it to her team, already anticipating a flurry of urgent responses and braces herself for another fire drill.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;New regulations mean changes to internal controls. This means hundreds of man-hours reviewing documents, comparing frameworks, updating controls, notifying teams, and preparing for audits. All this—while staying ahead of business goals.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For Priya, and thousands like her, this is not a once-in-a-while event. This is &lt;STRONG&gt;daily life&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In today’s hyper-regulated environment, where &lt;STRONG&gt;250+ regulatory change events&lt;/STRONG&gt; occur each day, &lt;STRONG&gt;manual compliance processes are no longer sustainable&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enter: &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Process Control with Regulatory Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a breakthrough SAP GRC innovation built on &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, powered by &lt;STRONG&gt;AI and Generative AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;, that’s helping professionals like Priya flip the compliance narrative from reactive to proactive—and from cost-center to competitive edge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Compliance Conundrum: A Modern Enterprise Challenge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today’s enterprises are dealing with:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Constantly evolving regulations (think GDPR, SOX, NIST, COBIT, MaRisk…)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Siloed compliance efforts across business units&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Inconsistent control documentation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Audit fatigue&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fear of non-compliance fines, loss of reputation, and erosion of stakeholder trust&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Manual processes for control mapping, documents handling is error prone, cost intensive, and increases &lt;STRONG&gt;risks&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;burnout&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Game Changer: SAP Process Control with Regulatory Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now let’s zoom into the innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the heart of this solution lies the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Process Control&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Regulatory Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt; service—on BTP, an AI-powered application designed to &lt;STRONG&gt;interpret&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;extract, compare, and map control requirements&lt;/STRONG&gt; across evolving regulatory documents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="_CK__0-1755162733019.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300772i8CF6F25960C032D6/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="_CK__0-1755162733019.png" alt="_CK__0-1755162733019.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s break it down through personas in a real-world narrative.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Priya Nair – Chief Compliance Officer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pain Point&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Challenged and facing mounting pressure by increasingly complex regulatory landscape.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With &lt;STRONG&gt;AI-powered Regulatory Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Priya’s team can now &lt;STRONG&gt;automatically extract control requirements&lt;/STRONG&gt; from large regulatory documents using NLP and machine learning. These are uploaded through the &lt;STRONG&gt;Import Control Requirements App&lt;/STRONG&gt; into SAP Process Control.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Impact&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Hours of manual reading and interpretation reduced to minutes. Regulations are now available in GRC system as meaningful control definitions.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“It’s like having a legal expert and a data analyst rolled into one AI assistant”&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;, Priya says.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Carlos Menendez – Control Owner in Finance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pain Point&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Updating internal controls with every regulatory change&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="_CK__6-1755163656693.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300786i0C3A4D522C3C7C91/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="_CK__6-1755163656693.png" alt="_CK__6-1755163656693.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using the &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Control Requirements App&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Carlos can quickly create or update internal controls—both centrally and locally—linked to his business processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Impact&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Faster response to regulatory change. Controls are tracked, assigned, and monitored periodically.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“I no longer rely on spreadsheets and emails—I now have a control cockpit”&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;, Carlos shares.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Jennifer Shen – Internal Auditor&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pain Point&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Identifying what changed in a regulation&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="_CK__3-1755162804841.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300774i9A7415799517BF86/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="_CK__3-1755162804841.png" alt="_CK__3-1755162804841.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With &lt;STRONG&gt;Delta Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Jennifer compares two versions of a regulatory framework and instantly sees what’s added, removed, or modified.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Impact&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Audit readiness improves drastically. Summary reports help prioritize control updates and decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“What took days of manual review now takes seconds”&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;, she smiles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Frameworks Are Supported?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Currently live within SAP SE environments, the solution supports:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;C5&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;COBIT&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;FitSM&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GHB&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;MaRisk&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;NIST&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SOX&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;

– Automatically detect gaps between existing controls and new regulations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Control Coverage Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Suggest additional controls using Gen AI, ensuring better control coverage.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Process Orchestration&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Enhanced sync between SAP Process Control and Regulatory Insights, helping drive resilience.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Benefits: From Cost Center to Strategic Advantage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Significant Cost Savings&lt;/STRONG&gt;: With ~250 regulatory change events a day, savings range between &lt;STRONG&gt;USD 50K to USD 250K&lt;/STRONG&gt; just from automation and reduced manual effort.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Audit Readiness&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Continuous delta analysis means controls are always audit-ready.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Smarter Risk Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Proactively mitigate non-compliance risks and enhance stakeholder trust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Strategic Focus&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Free up experts from mundane tasks—redirect efforts toward innovation and strategic resilience.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion: Turning Compliance Into Competitive Advantage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In a world where trust is the currency of business, non-compliance is not an option.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Process Control with Regulatory Insights is not just another GRC tool—it’s a &lt;STRONG&gt;strategic partner&lt;/STRONG&gt; for organizations that want to stay compliant, agile, and ahead of change.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

of regulators.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For CCOs like Priya, Control Owners like Carlos, and Auditors like Jennifer,&amp;nbsp; it is not just about managing risks - it is about enabling &lt;STRONG&gt;trusted growth&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automate regulatory interpretation and control mapping&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Instantly compare evolving regulations and identify control changes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Save costs and person-hours through AI-powered insights&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Build resilient and audit-ready internal control environments&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Future-proof compliance strategy with AI-led innovation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Want to see how SAP GRC with Regulatory Insights can transform your compliance posture?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Chandan Kalra, Director, GRC, Product Engineering | Srinath Ganesan, Director, Finance&amp;nbsp;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SvetlanaZalutskaya28_0-1755280451620.jpeg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301554i9D8F0BCC3408441D/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SvetlanaZalutskaya28_0-1755280451620.jpeg" alt="SvetlanaZalutskaya28_0-1755280451620.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Why this matters: the upcoming changes turn what looked like a technical switch into a strategic decision that can affect your budget, compliance posture, and HCM roadmap. Activations of Business Function for SAP HCM for SAP S/4HANA directly influence whether you need additional HCM licenses, which capabilities you can keep on-premise versus in Private Cloud, and how quickly you should plan a move to SuccessFactors for certain functions. Getting ahead of this now helps you avoid unplanned costs or audit exposure, prevents disruption to HR processes tied to payroll, time, and regulatory reporting, and gives you time to align contracts, license product codes, and project timelines. The guidance below distills what’s changing and the practical steps to stay compliant while keeping your transformation on track.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Starting with&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;S/4&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;HANA &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;2025&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, the &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Business Function for SAP HCM for SAP S/4&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;HANA &lt;SPAN class=""&gt; will&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; be turned on &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;by default.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;From this release on, t&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;here is no c&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;ompatibility&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; pack &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;for HCM&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; anymore.  This technical change &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;is not&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; reversible&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;. &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;The licensing requirements are applicable when SAP HCM is &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;utilized&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; beyond the scope of the HR Mini Ma&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;ster, in&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; cases where the customer is conducting HCM processes in the system&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;For the technical details, please check the KBA &lt;A class="" href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3443536/E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;3443536 - SAP S/4HANA Release 2025 will be delivered with active H4S4_1 Business Function - SAP for Me&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Some functionality is not available in S/4HANA Private Cloud; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;e.g.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; SAP Learning Solution is available in S/4HANA &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;on-premise&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, when moving to Private Cloud, the go-to solution is SuccessFactors Learning.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;You can see the details of what features are enabled and what are disabled you can check in the following note &lt;A class="" href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3091160/E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;3091160 - SAP HCM for SAP S/4HANA – General Approach and Strategy - SAP for Me&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;A customer using the HCM compatibility pack to&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;day &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;in SAP S/4HANA &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;on-premise&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; can receive a prolongation only if they move to SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition, via a lift-and-shift (like-for-like) migration that preserves the current release. If the move includes an upgrade to the 2025 release, the H4S4_1 business function will be active by default, and the HCM compatibility pack will no longer be available, so prolongation does not apply&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;With the requested change, they would get &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;the&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; prolongation as well &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;in case&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; they &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;directly move&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; to SuccessFactors, which is our strategic intent.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;HCM License Materials and Usage Rights&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SvetlanaZalutskaya28_0-1755279472568.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301552i677F4A50D067B5D7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SvetlanaZalutskaya28_0-1755279472568.png" alt="SvetlanaZalutskaya28_0-1755279472568.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Customers must also license SAP HCM for SAP S/4HANA latest the first day after the expiry of the Compatibility Package.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Please contact your account executive to plan the license conversion as soon as possible.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I hope you found this blog post helpful.

In many cases, these changes have introduced greater complexity, requiring organizations to adapt their strategies to ensure success.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From our recent project experience and industry observations, two main drivers stand out:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More complex M&amp;amp;A scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt; – including multi-entity, multi-source, and joint-venture carve-outs, often with heightened compliance and harmonization requirements.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology disruption&lt;/STRONG&gt; – particularly the accelerated move to the cloud and the looming SAP ECC end-of-maintenance deadlines (2027, or 2030 with costly extended maintenance under SAP RISE).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this update, I will explore these emerging trends from two perspectives:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business &amp;amp; M&amp;amp;A Scenario-Driven Trends (Part I):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Harmonization of processes and structures&lt;/STRONG&gt; during the carve-out to reduce operational complexity post-transition.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-source and joint-venture carve-outs&lt;/STRONG&gt; that combine data from different systems into a consolidated environment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced compliance and legal alignment&lt;/STRONG&gt; to address stricter regulatory and contractual requirements.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Continuity and Operational Excellence&lt;/STRONG&gt; during and after go-live to keep operations running seamlessly and without any business disruption&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology-Driven Trends (Part II):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Move to cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt; – whether via hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) in private hosting, or through SAP RISE and GROW with SAP offerings.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Expanded functional and integration scope&lt;/STRONG&gt; – including SAP modules, third-party systems (Salesforce, Ariba, IBP, EDI), and rebuilt analytics landscapes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Combined carve-out and S/4HANA transformation&lt;/STRONG&gt; to deliver a modern, value-enhanced system to the buyer.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom code carve-out and clean-core modernization&lt;/STRONG&gt; to simplify future operations and reduce technical debt.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Both parts of this post build on the foundation of the original series, now enriched with current project examples and the latest industry best practices - offering a forward-looking view of what it takes to execute a successful carve-out in 2025 and beyond.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business and M&amp;amp;A Scenario–Driven Trends in Modern SAP Carve-Outs &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Harmonization of Processes and Structures&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In recent years, we have seen a growing emphasis on harmonizing processes and organizational structures during carve-outs – especially to reduce operational complexity after the transition. This is particularly common among private equity buyers, who aim to simplify process variants, adopt industry best practices over heavy customization, and standardize reporting structures across multiple acquisitions. Two main approaches are used:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Option 1: Greenfield Implementation in the Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some buyers opt for a brand-new SAP system - often in an SAP GROW public cloud environment - built entirely on standardized, industry best-practice processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Advantages: Fast to implement, provides a clean slate, and allows extensions via SAP BTP without burdening the core system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Caveats:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Historic data is typically lost, requiring separate archival for audit or business purposes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The “big bang” cutover into entirely new processes can disrupt business operations without strong change management.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach is best suited for asset deals or acquisitions of smaller, less complex entities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Option 2: Selective Data Transition (SDT)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the right Transformation Software, SDT enables you to migrate only selected data while simultaneously transforming processes, configurations, and structures. For example, in a carve-out involving multiple company codes from a highly integrated environment, intercompany relationships may need to be converted into customer-vendor-structures - requiring both process reconfiguration and master/transactional data transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SDT also allows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Changing charts of accounts, profit/cost centers, plants, and org structures.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Transforming open and historical transactional data to match new processes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Maintaining a continuity of historical data in the new environment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Trade-offs:&amp;nbsp;SDT is more complex, typically requiring 6-12 months for high-complexity projects and demanding greater involvement from both IT and business teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have seen SDT increasingly used in share deals, spin-offs, and large-scale asset divestitures with significant process complexity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Multi-Source &amp;amp; Joint-Venture Carve-Outs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another fast-growing trend involves multi-source and joint-venture carve-outs, where data from multiple ERP systems must be consolidated into one new environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Typical scenarios:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-source carve-out&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Extracting data from several ERP systems (ECC, S/4HANA, or both) within the same organization, often during ongoing SAP S/4HANA transformation projects.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joint-venture setup&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Merging data and processes from multiple partners into a shared system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Challenges include:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Harmonizing master data, processes, charts of accounts, and org structures – including historic transactional data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Managing licensing and data visibility between different corporate owners.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Separating and rebuilding formerly shared subsystems or third-party integrations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Given their complexity, these projects nearly always use SDT combined with system merge methodologies, cross-system harmonization, and automation for plant or unit reallocation - while ensuring strict data access controls between Joint-Venture partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, these projects require a significant engagement from SAP specialists to adjust and reshape processes, harmonize data and organizaional structures, properly adjust interfaces to external or cloud-based systems, and enhance data analytics and reporting. Due to the variety of skill sets needed and the urgency in a carve-out project, the setup usually requires engaging with a specialized System Integrator (SI) early in the project planning phase to ensure these topics are successfully covered.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Enhanced Compliance &amp;amp; Legal Alignment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Stricter regulations and geopolitical constraints now significantly influence carve-out planning and execution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Examples include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GDPR for companies doing business in EU-countries&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Industry-specific requirements (e.g., regulated industries like Utilities, Aerospace &amp;amp; Defense).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data sovereignty laws such as China’s DSL, CSL, and PIPL, which can require a separate, localized SAP system, to protect your global business data by keeping it separate.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Implications:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Migrate only approved data subsets, particularly personal data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensure full audit documentation of extraction, transformation, and loading.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Include technical safeguards such as log tracing, reversible deletions, and cutover checks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Modern SDT Software products - like &lt;A title="Transformation Software: cbs ET Enterprise Transformer " href="https://www.cbs-consulting.com/us/next-one/cbs-et/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;cbs ET Enterprise Transformer&lt;/A&gt; - already offer audit-grade logging for these processes, making compliance easier to prove post-project.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Vendor landscape Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the context of the SDT approach, it is worth noting that only four vendors worldwide currently provide both the specialized SDT software and the associated service capabilities needed for complex carve-out scenarios. All are members of the &lt;A title="SAP S/4HANA Selective Data Transition Engagement Program" href="https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/support-services/data-management-landscape-transformation/selective-data-transition-engagement.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Selective Data Transition Engagement Program&lt;/A&gt; and typically collaborate with other system integrators (SI) to cover the full range of services required.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At present, only &lt;A title="cbs - currently the only vendor to deliver complete end-to-end SAP Carve-Out and Divestiture projects" href="https://www.cbs-consulting.com/us/mergers-acquisitions-and-divestitures/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;one of these vendors is able to deliver the complete end-to-end&lt;/A&gt; service portfolio independently - an advantage that means fewer communication gaps, with consultants who understand the full scope of services and the role of SDT in the project, rather than working in isolated silos.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Given the sustained market demand for SDT-based initiatives - including both carve-outs and broader SAP S/4HANA transformation projects - delivery capacity can become a bottleneck. To mitigate this risk, organizations should secure delivery slots as early as possible, ideally before the transaction is finalized and the Transition Services Agreement (TSA) is signed, to ensure the resource availability and alignment with agreed project timelines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Business Continuity and Operational Excellence during and after go/live&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A successful carve-out is not just about getting the technical cutover right - it’s equally about ensuring the carved-out organization can operate smoothly from day one. One of the most significant risks during these projects is operational disruption, which both buyer and seller are highly motivated to avoid before, during, and after the system handover. Maintaining stable business operations has increasingly become therefore a central project goal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Change Management and Training&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond ensuring clean, accurate data in the new system, it is critical to prepare the business workforce for changes to their daily processes and routines. This requires structured change management and targeted training in all areas where processes are being redesigned or where new roles and responsibilities are introduced. This becomes even more important when moving to more standardized, harmonized processes - often with fewer customization and a leaner user interface than in the previous environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In such cases, acceptance grows when users understand the why behind the change and are given the tools and guidance to confidently perform their work in the new system. Proper preparation minimizes post–go-live disruption and supports long-term adoption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application Management Services (AMS)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In recent years, we have seen a strong trend toward integrating AMS into carve-out project scope from the outset. This is particularly relevant when:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The carved-out entity lacks internal SAP expertise after organizational changes or downsizing post-transaction.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The seller’s IT services under the TSA come at a premium, and the buyer seeks a faster, more cost-effective transition away from them.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The buyer needs a bridging solution until a new internal IT team is in place.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some AMS providers even offer fractional consulting for small-scale enhancements and process improvements after go-live, adding flexibility during the stabilization phase.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Choosing a provider who delivers AMS as part of a comprehensive business transformation has clear advantages, as they understand carve-out–specific requirements such as altered team responsibilities, new support structures, and heightened service continuity needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For smaller and mid-sized organizations, &lt;A title="Download PDF" href="https://middlemarketgrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SAPSupplement2022_Revised_CombinedPDF.pdf" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP’s M&amp;amp;A Ambassador Program&lt;/A&gt; can be a valuable option, particularly for PE-driven carve-outs. It equips these projects with expert partner frameworks to manage both the initial deployment and post-go-live stabilization. Unfortunately, this program does not include any provider with SDT capabilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recommendation: Define AMS scope and contracts early - including infrastructure operations, interface monitoring, patching, SLA targets, and knowledge handover - so that post-go-live operations run as smoothly as the cutover itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary of Part I and Key Takeaways&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Over the past years, my team and I have seen, and experienced with our customers, that carve-outs in 2025 are no longer purely IT-driven exercises.They are strategic business transformations requiring early leadership engagement and precise planning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the business side, the key success factors are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Early preparation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Business readiness and TSA alignment before signing prevent costly delays.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Selective Data Transition (SDT) as a game changer&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Enabling selective migration and process harmonization with minimal disruption; early partner selection is crucial given limited global capacity.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integrated service delivery&lt;/STRONG&gt;: One provider delivering end-to-end reduces communication gaps and ensures holistic understanding.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business continuity protection&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Early investment in process mapping, change management, and training ensures smoother cutovers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Built-in stabilization&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Integrating AMS from the onset speeds post–go-live recovery.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Organizational change management&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Early engagement drives faster adoption and productivity.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the technical delivery models, toolsets, and SDT-related innovations shaping carve-outs in 2025 and beyond, see Part II of this Update 2025 post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’d like to discuss your own carve-out scenario, feel free to contact me directly. @&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/741349" target="_blank"&gt;Lorenz_Praefcke2&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In today's growing CRM demand faster, more agile implementations with minimal overhead. SAP understands this need and has responded with a new generation of &lt;STRONG&gt;standard integration packages&lt;/STRONG&gt; for &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Sales &amp;amp; Service Cloud v2&lt;/STRONG&gt;, specially tailored for industries such as &lt;STRONG&gt;Utilities&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Service Management (ESM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. These pre-packaged solutions are designed for &lt;STRONG&gt;plug-and-play integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;, eliminating the need for extensive customization and ensuring rapid deployment and value realization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1737898317"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#0000FF"&gt;Why Standard Integration Packages?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditionally, integration projects have required significant customization, consulting hours, and effort. This often led to increased costs, longer go-live timelines, and higher maintenance overhead. Standard integration packages reverse this model by offering:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Preconfigured scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Best practice processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Certified integration content&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Zero or minimal customization requirements&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These benefits help organizations streamline operations, reduce IT complexity, and accelerate time-to-value.&lt;span

    <title>Driving Resilience Through Intelligent Supply Chain Orchestration</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In today’s global economy, supply chains are under greater pressure than ever before. Shifting trade regulations, evolving geopolitical landscapes, labor shortages, and rising customer expectations are driving unprecedented complexity. Many organizations are realizing that traditional, siloed approaches to supply chain management are no longer enough to remain competitive—or to simply keep pace with disruption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The stakes are high: one weak link can set off ripple effects across operations, manufacturing, logistics, and customer delivery. For businesses that rely on complex supplier networks and face unpredictable market dynamics, resilience can’t be an afterthought, it must be designed into the supply chain itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That’s where&amp;nbsp;supply chain orchestration&amp;nbsp;comes in. Rather than focusing on isolated improvements within functional areas, orchestration integrates processes, data, and decision-making across the entire value chain. With the right strategy, companies can transform supply chains from reactive networks into connected ecosystems that anticipate shifts, adapt rapidly to disruptions, and deliver on customer promises.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To help you explore how orchestration creates more effective and future-ready supply chains,&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&amp;amp;eventid=5020561&amp;amp;sessionid=1&amp;amp;key=57E9F6DDDA69192982DCB4CDB97E69A5&amp;amp;groupId=6247340&amp;amp;partnerref=blog&amp;amp;sourcepage=register" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP, HP, and Accenture&amp;nbsp;are hosting a&amp;nbsp; webinar&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;designed for supply chain and operations leaders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The session will showcase the opportunities orchestration brings to organizations across industries, and offer practical ways to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve agility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and mitigate disruption with aligned, end-to-end processes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhance visibility and execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;for faster, smarter, AI-supported decisions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Strengthen coordination&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;with suppliers and partners while building a foundation for scalable, proactive operations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Join my guests:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antoine Colin, &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Senior VP, Supply Chain Transformation and Resilience, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;HP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sid Gudal, &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Managing Director, Partner, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accenture&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sudy Bharadwaj, &lt;/STRONG&gt;Global VP, Strategic Engagements, Intelligent Spend and Business Networks SAP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&amp;amp;eventid=5020561&amp;amp;sessionid=1&amp;amp;key=57E9F6DDDA69192982DCB4CDB97E69A5&amp;amp;groupId=6247340&amp;amp;partnerref=blog&amp;amp;sourcepage=register" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Driving Resilience Through Intelligent Supply Chain Orchestration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tuesday, September 02, 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This blog post was prompted by a recent issue in SAP customer support for SAP Fiori apps. I want to share the background, hoping it helps prevent a similar situation in your environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1609646920"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Browser and Platform Support&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP's &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/pam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Product Availability Matrix (PAM)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides the single source of truth for SAP software releases, including platform availability on browsers and operating systems. Regarding SAPUI5, note that SAPUI5 is not a product of its own, so please check the PAM for the product you're using SAPUI5 with. For more information, see SAP Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1716423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1716423&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Browsers constantly evolve across devices to offer new capabilities and address newly detected security issues. Upgrades of browsers may introduce changes that are not backward compatible, affecting SAPUI5 and SAP software behavior. Browser upgrades may also require specific platform or operating system versions for all end users. Vendors do not provide (security) updates for browsers or platforms that are out of maintenance, which then are severe risk to productive environments.&amp;nbsp;Keep in mind that SAP has no control over browser upgrades, their capabilities, or maintenance duration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In other words: In Web development, especially with browsers: &lt;STRONG&gt;"Never touch a running system" is *NOT* an option&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1413133415"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Browsers for SAPUI5&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAPUI5 applications in productive SAP products require a minimum browser version to ensure full availability and security. This also lets SAPUI5 use current industry standards, such as &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/0cb44d7a147640a0890cefa5fd7c7f8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ECMAScript&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, to deliver a modern and intuitive experience for SAP Business Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="293385_GettyImages-177504059_large_jpg.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304999iED2B76D7D454CE95/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="293385_GettyImages-177504059_large_jpg.jpg" alt="293385_GettyImages-177504059_large_jpg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Based on my own experience in the SAPUI5 team, I can confirm missing this requirement is a real-life risk. My conversations with customer support colleagues confirm this: productive SAP customers experienced outages because end users worked with browsers that were out of maintenance. One example can be seen in SAP Note &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3639059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3639059 - Blank home screen in SAP Fiori Launchpad - SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, which prompted this blog post. Using an outdated browser, end users saw a blank screen; developers got an error "Promise.withResolvers is not a function" in the console. The resolution for such cases is to update to the latest browser version, which in some cases may even require a costly operating system upgrade for all business users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, I recommend monitoring the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/pam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Product Availability Matrix (PAM)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; and specifically the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/74b59efa0eef48988d3b716bd0ecc933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAPUI5 Browser and Platform Support&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;For any MRO organization (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations), kitting and staging is a core warehouse activity. On the surface, it seems simple. But in reality, it's a web of complexity, often managed by years of accumulated custom code and custom business process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1960883375"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introducing Standard Kitting &amp;amp; Staging in S/4HANA 2023&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;With the release of&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA 2023 FPS02&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the struggle with custom kitting solutions is over. SAP has delivered a standard, industry-focused solution designed specifically for the intricacies of MRO:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;End-to-End Kitting &amp;amp; Staging with SAP Field Logistics.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This solution was co-designed with customers to address the real-world challenges you face every day. It’s built on six core principles to deliver a unified, streamlined process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Centralize Kitting for Remote Operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Efficiently to build, stage, and dispatch kits from a central warehouse directly to remote or field locations, ensuring the right parts are in the right place at the right time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Handle All Types of Goods Seamlessly&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Support not only inventory managed materials, but also non inventory stock, rental equipment and supplier provided items as part of services, ensuring full visibility and control across all goods movements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Empower Your Field Locations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Don’t just ship parts—ship capability. Remote sites can now receive kits, manage kits, add locally held components, and issue the completed kit directly to a maintenance order.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Simplify and Standardize Your Processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Whether you operate a single, streamlined plant or manage a complex network of remote locations supported by a supply base, this solution provides a standard, repeatable process to eliminate guesswork and create one version of the truth for your kitting and staging operations.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Gain End-to-End Visibility in a Single Place&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Stop chasing information across different systems. The entire kitting lifecycle—from creation and staging to dispatch and final issuance—is tracked in a single, accessible repository, giving you unprecedented control and insight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Scale for Your Environment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This isn't a rigid, one-size-fits-all tool. The solution is designed to scale and adapt, supporting various warehouse management setups including Inventory Management (IM), Extended Warehouse Management (EWM), and even hybrid combinations depending on your organisation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1764369870"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Future-Proof Foundation for Your MRO Warehouse&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;By embedding this critical MRO process directly into the S/4HANA core, SAP has delivered a solution that is robust, scalable, and future proof. You can finally retire that aging custom code, move forward with confidence using a standard SAP solution at the base.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This is more than just a new feature; it's a new foundation for operational excellence in your MRO supply chain.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_1-1755517944567.png" style="width: 936px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301947i655D233314DDE929/image-dimensions/936x520?v=v2" width="936" height="520" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_1-1755517944567.png" alt="simon_thomson99_1-1755517944567.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1438773646"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;From Order to Staged Kit: A Look at the New Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;So, how does it actually work? The entire process is designed to be intuitive and integrated with maintenance and project business process.&amp;nbsp; And it all begins exactly where it should: with the demand from the field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1: The Kit is Born from the Demand Signal&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;It all starts with a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Work Order&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;or&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Network Order;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;the kit is automatically created and updated. As the requested materials arrive at the &lt;STRONG&gt;Supply Base&lt;/STRONG&gt;, using the Field Logistics Cross-Docking process, the system automatically triggers the tracking milestones and begins the process of bringing everything together.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;What truly sets this solution apart is its flexibility in defining the kit. You are no longer locked into a single method like in the past. At the demand plant level, you can define a kit based:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Work Order/Network Order Header:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Perfect for bundling all materials where work is planned and scheduled at the header.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Work Order/Network Order Operation:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Ideal for creating kits for specific phases or tasks within a more detailed &lt;/FONT&gt;planning and scheduling environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A flexible definition via BAdI:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;For unique business requirements, this allows you to implement custom logic while remaining within the standard framework.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2: Augment the Kit with Local Inventory&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The process doesn't stop with the initial cross dock. If required, you can easily supplement the base kit by adding stock directly from local base inventory or as more cross docking occurs. This hybrid approach allows you to combine centrally sourced materials with locally available parts for maximum efficiency, speed and tracking.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3: Pack, Stage, and Track with Precision&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Once complete, the kit can be packed into standard Field Logistics objects like&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Containers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;or &lt;STRONG&gt;Packages&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;Crucially, every object—including the delivery items —can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin via a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard field &lt;/STRONG&gt;via the&lt;STRONG&gt; Pack Containers &lt;/STRONG&gt;(&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F5786')/S30PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F5786&lt;/A&gt;)app. This eliminates guesswork and "lost" kits. The result is pinpoint accuracy on the warehouse floor, where everyone knows exactly what a kit contains, where it is, and which job it’s for.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_5-1755523335642.png" style="width: 935px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301986i6D29E1BC05A41826/image-dimensions/935x520?v=v2" width="935" height="520" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_5-1755523335642.png" alt="simon_thomson99_5-1755523335642.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1242260141"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Flexibility at the Edge: Managing Kits Upon Arrival&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;The journey doesn't end when the kit leaves the central warehouse. A core strength of SAP Field Logistics is its ability to track the Supply Chain end to end. The solution is designed to handle several common scenarios:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1174829355"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario 1: The "Base Kit" Handover&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;In this model, all components have been kitted at the central base. The kit arrives at the remote location fully prepared. The process here is built for speed and simplicity:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Receive:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The remote site performs a simple goods receipt for the complete kit.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stage:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The kit is stored, ready for the job.&amp;nbsp; The kit can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin via a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard field.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-978315850"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario 2: The "Remote Kit" Assembly&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This scenario is common in industries like Mining or Land-Based Operations where remote sites are highly self-sufficient. Here, no physical goods are shipped from the base. Instead:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Demand Signal:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The demand is to be supplied fully from the remote site.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Local Assembly:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The kit is assembled and managed&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;entirely&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;at the remote location using its locally held inventory. This empowers the remote team to take full ownership of the kitting process and support the operations stocking strategy.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stage:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The kit is stored, ready for the job.&amp;nbsp; The kit can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin via a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard field.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-781802345"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario 3: The "Re-Kit" Hybrid Model&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This flexible, hybrid approach offers the best of both worlds. A base kit containing centrally sourced or specialized parts is shipped from the main warehouse. Upon arrival:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Receive Base Kit:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The initial kit is received at the remote location.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Augment Locally:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The remote team then adds further components to the kit directly from their local inventory to create the final package.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stage:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The kit is stored, ready for the job.&amp;nbsp; The kit can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin via a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard field.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This adaptability—from a simple handover to full remote assembly—ensures that no matter your operational model, the system supports your reality on the ground.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_6-1755525355616.png" style="width: 936px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301994iADB91607C7B6A538/image-dimensions/936x530?v=v2" width="936" height="530" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_6-1755525355616.png" alt="simon_thomson99_6-1755525355616.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-456206121"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mastering "The Last Mile": Detailed Tracking at the Remote Site&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;The final journey of a kit—from the remote warehouse shelf to the hands of a technician—is often a logistical black box. This critical phase, aptly named&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"The Last Mile,"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;is where parts get misplaced, jobs get delayed, and efficiency breaks down. A common problem is the lack of real-time visibility once a kit is "in the system" but not yet in use.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;SAP Field Logistics solves this by introducing key tracking milestones for the entire "Last Mile" lifecycle. Now, users can pinpoint exactly where everything is in real-time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Stage -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;Once a kit item is received or assembled at the remote location, its status is set to&amp;nbsp;Staged. It is officially logged as staged and ready for the job. The kit can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin using a dedicated standard field. The warehouse knows exactly what is ready and precisely where to find it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Drop -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;As the job start time approaches, the kit needs to move closer to the point of work. When this happens, its status is updated to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dropped&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It can then be assigned to a nominated drop point—like a specific laydown yard or workshop area—again using a &lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard location field&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Issue -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This is the final, crucial handover. The kits items status is updated to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Issued&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;at the moment the technician formally receives the complete kit. This closes the loop on the logistics process, providing a clear and simple audit trail. It confirms that the right parts were delivered to the right person at the right time, minimizing disputes and ensuring the job can begin without delay.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_4-1755518069378.png" style="width: 936px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301950i773F64581600DAA2/image-dimensions/936x504?v=v2" width="936" height="504" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_4-1755518069378.png" alt="simon_thomson99_4-1755518069378.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-259692616"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Unlocking Total Visibility: Answering "Where Is My Stuff?"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;In any MRO operation, the question "Where is my stuff?" is asked daily. But "stuff" can mean anything—an individual component, a complex kit for a shutdown, or all the materials for a week's worth of routine maintenance. Answering this question accurately and in real-time has always been a major challenge.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;SAP Field Logistics answers this question by tracking every item against extensive, standard milestones, it provides a single source of truth. This critical information is no longer buried in spreadsheets or system tables; it is visualized in intuitive Fiori applications and via exposed API's.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;While day-to-day operations are handled in the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Kits &lt;/STRONG&gt;(&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F8005')/S30PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F8005&lt;/A&gt;)&amp;nbsp;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Logistics &lt;/STRONG&gt;(&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F5082')/S30PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F5082&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;) apps, the consolidated view of this new visibility comes to life in the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Logistics Tracking &lt;/STRONG&gt;(&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F7382')/S30PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F7382&lt;/A&gt;) app.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;First delivered with S/4HANA 2023 FPS00, the Logistics Tracking App has now been specifically enhanced to include the key kitting milestones. This means the "Last Mile" statuses—&lt;STRONG&gt;Stage, Drop, and Issue&lt;/STRONG&gt;—are now surfaced directly in this central dashboard.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;The result is a single view where planners, supervisors, and technicians can see the real-time status of any component or kit, from the central warehouse all the way to the point of use. The question is no longer "Where is my stuff?" but "What do I need to look at next?"&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_7-1755525467499.png" style="width: 940px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301995i238FDB14748A46B3/image-dimensions/940x506?v=v2" width="940" height="506" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_7-1755525467499.png" alt="simon_thomson99_7-1755525467499.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-63179111"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Five Core Capabilities That Transform MRO Logistics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;Having walked through the end-to-end process, from the central warehouse to the final handover, we can see how SAP Field Logistics delivers a set of transformative capabilities that directly address the core challenges of MRO supply chains.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. A Single, Standardized Process from Warehouse to Worksite&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;For the first time, a single, standard process governs the entire kitting lifecycle. From the initial build in a supply base to augmenting a kit at a remote site and issuing it to a technician, the system provides one unified framework. This eliminates process variations, reduces training overhead, and establishes a foundation for operational excellence across the entire organization.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Real-Time, End-to-End Visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The question "Where is my stuff?" is definitively answered. Through the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Logistics Tracking App&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and dedicated Fiori dashboards, you have a single source of truth. By tracking key milestones like&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Staged, Dropped, and Issued&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you gain complete, real-time visibility into the "Last Mile," enabling better decision-making and proactive control.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Flexibility for Real-World Operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is not a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution. It is built to adapt to your reality. Whether you need to define a kit by an entire work order or a specific operation, or whether you manage kits centrally, remotely, or through a hybrid model, the solution provides the flexibility to support your specific business needs.&amp;nbsp; For example - your operation does not drop but issues directly from staging, this is supported.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Integration with Core Maintenance and Warehouse Processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SAP Field Logistics is not a standalone module; it is woven into the digital core. It integrates seamlessly with Maintenance Orders, Network Orders, Logistics Execution (LE), Inventory Management (IM), and Extended Warehouse Management (EWM). This ensures data consistency, prevents information silos, and creates a smooth, automated flow from maintenance planning to field execution.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Finally Retire Custom Code and Embrace a Clean Core&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Perhaps the most strategic benefit is the ability to finally retire your expensive, high-risk custom kitting solutions. By moving this critical functionality into the S/4HANA standard, you can eliminate technical debt, simplify future upgrades, and fully embrace a "clean core" strategy. This reduces your total cost of ownership and positions your organization on a future-proof platform for years to come.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--208565763"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion: The Future is Standard&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;For years, managing MRO kitting has meant a compromise. Organizations were forced to choose between a standard SAP process that didn't fully meet their needs or investing heavily in complex, custom-coded solutions that created technical debt and upgrade risk. These "Z-solutions," while functional, were brittle, expensive to maintain, and operated in a silo with each customer to define everything including integration.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;With the introduction of SAP Field Logistics in S/4HANA, that era is over.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;The journey from a fragmented, high-maintenance custom process to a powerful, flexible, and standard solution is no longer a future ambition—it is a present reality. We have seen how Field Logistics provides a single, unified framework to:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Define and build&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;kits with flexibility.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;them across diverse remote site scenarios.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Track&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;them through "The Last Mile."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Visualize&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;their status in real-time for all stakeholders.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This is more than a new module; it is a fundamental shift in strategy.

    <title>The Smart Path to S/4HANA EWM</title>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="ember57" id="toc-hId-1759052961"&gt;Overview of the current four solutions&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;There are currently four SAP solutions to help you manage your warehouse: Stockroom Management; Warehouse Management; EWM Basic; and EWM Advanced. Below, we’ll look at the differences between them. Note that there will be no further development of the first two, as SAP is positioning EWM on S/4HANA as the strategic choice going forward. Its key benefits include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Better warehouse performance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Complete process and stock transparency&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Preconfigured best practice content&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Clear roadmap of future developments&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supported by latest technologies and continuous innovation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Scalability and flexible extension options&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lowest TCO&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember60" id="toc-hId-1562539456"&gt;Can Stockroom Management replace a transition to EWM?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;You probably know that SAP introduced SAP Stockroom Management in 2020, running on S/4HANA. This solution is helpful for small warehouses with predominantly manual processes that only require a few basic functions, such as storage bin management. However, it isn’t suited to industrial companies looking to streamline their logistical processes across the board. For example, Stockroom Management doesn’t include functions such as task and resource management; value-added services; cross-docking; picking waves; or WM-LSR. As noted above, this product will not be developed any further.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember62" id="toc-hId-1366025951"&gt;Choosing the right EWM solution for you&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Now that we’ve established that most companies will likely want to transition to EWM, let’s look at the options available. In terms of the solutions embedded in S/4HANA, you can choose between EWM Basic Warehousing and EWM Advanced Warehousing, for which an additional license is required.&amp;nbsp; If you prefer a decentralized solution, SAP offers the extended cloud variant of EWM as well as the decentralized version on S/4HANA. It’s important for companies to look into the features and functions they need for their processes and what could be dropped. Here’s an overview to make your selection easier.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;Overview of features and functions in SAP WM offerings&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember65" id="toc-hId-1169512446"&gt;SDT: the optimal migration approach for EWM&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Unlike an ECC to S/4HANA transition, migrating to EWM is a little more complex in that the previous system was part of SCM as opposed to ECC. As such, a classic brownfield migration using automatic system conversion isn’t available. One solution would be to start from scratch with a new system (greenfield), although this involves redesigning your processes. Selective data transformation is clearly the better option here, as it enables you to reuse your business and historical data while updating your existing processes. This migration concept is available from SAP as well as its SDT partners: Natuvion, cbs, and SNP.&amp;nbsp; These offer specialized migration and mapping tools that accelerate the process of data analysis, selection, and verification.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember67" id="toc-hId-972998941"&gt;The importance of dealing with transactional data&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Customers using EWM 9.x can use the SAP Migration Cockpit to move to S/4HANA, although the cockpit doesn’t handle transactional data, cross-client customizing or user authentication so companies would need to look after those aspects themselves or work with their SAP SDT partner. If they are unable to leave the old transactional data behind, they could use SAP’s SDT partners’ tools to transfer it to the central control system, then to map and update the transactional data prior to migrating it to the new EWM system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember69" id="toc-hId-776485436"&gt;Deciding what to migrate and what to archive&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Many companies find the process complex as they often use highly specialized processes, making it difficult to decide what to transfer and what to leave behind. In addition, there may be legal considerations such as a requirement to retain data for a certain number of years. SAP and its SDT partners can assist with this process, particularly with regard to reducing the size of the database to be migrated. S/4HANA databases can be expensive to maintain if they are large and continue to grow. Archiving solutions are available that enable you to keep and access the old data for auditing and research purposes, while only transferring currently useful data. This approach offers big benefits in terms of cost and performance for the new system while preserving and protecting the historical data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember71" id="toc-hId-579971931"&gt;Three key aspects to consider before starting an EWM migration&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The first element&lt;/STRONG&gt;to consider is dealing with the custom code – repository objects – as many warehouses have very specific hardware and structures. The Custom Code Impact Analysis service can help here, as it highlights whether and how this data will be affected by the move to the new infrastructure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The second aspect&lt;/STRONG&gt;is closing the old documents. A prerequisite of S/4HANA is that docs are closed before being moved. Yet some documents can’t be closed, especially quality inspection documents and others that have to be open all the time. The SDT approach helps here as it will move both open and closed documents. This applies whether you’re choosing the embedded or the decentralized SAP EWM solution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Last but not least, downtime.&lt;/STRONG&gt;Greenfield projects require several shorter downtime incidences, while SDT usually only requires one. Near-zero downtime may not be possible given the specificities of warehouse systems, but the right tools, like those offered by the SAP SDT partners can make a significant contribution to reducing the impact on business continuity.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember73" id="toc-hId-383458426"&gt;Decentralized option for better performance&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP and its SDT partners have estimated that 90-95% of their customers decide on a decentralized EWM system on S/4HANA in preference to the embedded variant. This is because it’s the strategic platform and more future-proof from a data volume perspective, especially for customers with large databases and warehouse systems.&amp;nbsp; In addition, if someone else in your company is doing some heavy-duty data extraction on the ERP system, there may be a slowdown effect on an EWM embedded in the ERP system that would not arise with a decentralized option.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember75" id="toc-hId-186944921"&gt;Talk to us!&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Despite the complexities of moving from an SCM-based solution to EWM on S/4HANA, SAP and its SDT partners have the tools and experience to smooth the path for its customers.

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1608668661" id="toc-hId-1608933702"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Service Entry Sheet (SES)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;is used to confirm that services ordered through a purchase order have been rendered by the vendor. Once accepted, the SES triggers the posting of a service receipt in the system, which serves as the basis for vendor invoicing and financial postings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accruals&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;in the context of SES ensure that expenses for services received but not yet invoiced are recognized in the correct accounting period. This is critical for accurate&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;period-end closing&lt;/STRONG&gt;, aligning with accrual-based accounting principles. In SAP S/4HANA, the system can automatically generate accrual postings for unbilled services, recording them in&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;GR/IR (Goods Receipt/Invoice Receipt)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;or specific accrual accounts, depending on configuration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The process typically involves:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Creation of Purchase Order (PO)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Entry of&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Service Entry Sheet and Send for Approval&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatic Posting for Accrual&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;at period-end for unapproved SES items.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Service Entry Sheet Accrual&lt;/STRONG&gt;, organizations benefit from:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Embedded&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fiori apps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for SES creation, approval, and accrual management.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integration with&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance (FI)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Materials Management (MM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;modules for seamless tracking.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Real-time reporting capabilities to monitor open SES accruals.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Compliance with IFRS/GAAP through precise period-based expense recognition.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This functionality ensures&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;financial accuracy&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enhances&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;transparency&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and supports&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;audit readiness&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;by maintaining a clear link between service receipt, accrual recognition, and final settlement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1412155156"

The result? Smoother month-ends, stronger compliance, and cleaner insights for smarter decision-making&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Summary&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog post describes how to build a planning monitoring tool to evaluate and manage the MRP results for multiple materials. This tool can show per material the historical consumption data – &lt;EM&gt;consumption-based planning&lt;/EM&gt; – together with the stocks and requirements information – &lt;EM&gt;material requirements planning&lt;/EM&gt; –, and the corresponding MRP created receipt elements to cover the shortages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The target audience for this blog post will be consulting people, project team members, key users, and subject matter experts who are interested on the visualization of the MRP results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Introduction&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A typical customer requirement is to &lt;U&gt;visualize the result of the MRP run for several materials in a report format&lt;/U&gt;, that is, they want MD04 for every material on a plant in a single screen. The purpose is to have an easy and fast way of identification of critical materials where the planner needs to take an action, and then being able to select the specific material and drill down into the stock, requirements and planning elements details. There is not a standard report available that would show a detailed display of stock/requirements list for multiple materials.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A &lt;U&gt;collective MRP results view&lt;/U&gt; is normally something very difficult to build, as companies have thousands of materials per plant with different business cases concerning procurement types, planning strategies, production types, origin of the requirements, etc… Furthermore, the target information to be displayed is different depending on the user role:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As a production supervisor, buyer, sales executive or MRP controller, you want to access information on the stock/requirements situation of the material, and then gain an overview of the development of stock and requirements in the coming weeks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As a production supervisor, you want to gain an overview of the MRP elements for in-house production (planned orders, production orders, dependent reservations) or of the MRP elements for a particular production line.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As a buyer, you want to check which purchase orders and purchase requisitions exist for a material for a particular vendor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As a sales executive, you are only interested in the current sales orders for a particular customer for a material.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As an MRP controller, you are interested in available quantities based on sales orders that have actually been received and not on the basis of the planned independent requirements. You therefore want the planned independent requirements to be displayed, but do not want to change the available quantity if sales order exists.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As an MRP controller, you want to be informed about the requirements of bulk materials or materials that are planned using consumption-based planning, to check whether these requirements occur continually.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another issue to consider is the requirement of some customers to manage historical consumption data together with the requirements information, thus allowing them to &lt;U&gt;compare future needs with past consumptions&lt;/U&gt; on the same periods in the same single screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, having all these requirements and conditions in mind, we may think that building a collective tool to evaluate and manage the MRP results for multiple materials becomes a great challenge. This blog explains how this collective planning tool can be built for isolated and specific planning scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Evaluating the Planning Run on SAP S/4HANA&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Classic MRP&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the available tools for checking the planning results are the following:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Stock/Requirements List&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;MRP List&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Evaluation of the Planning Situation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Evaluation of the Planning Result&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Planning Table for repetitive manufacturing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the planning run, the system analyzes the requirements that exist for the planned materials and creates procurement or manufacturing elements to cover these requirements. The evaluations on these tools show all&amp;nbsp;receipt and issue elements&amp;nbsp;for a material in tabular form and enable you to gain a quick&amp;nbsp;overview&amp;nbsp;of the stock/requirements situation for the material as well as to branch into the&amp;nbsp;processing&amp;nbsp;function for the MRP elements for this material.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the &lt;STRONG&gt;stock/requirements list&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;most up-to-date stock and requirements situation&amp;nbsp;is displayed. Changes that are made after the planning date are displayed directly, so the list is &lt;U&gt;dynamic&lt;/U&gt;. The &lt;STRONG&gt;MRP list&lt;/STRONG&gt; always displays the stock/requirements situation&amp;nbsp;at the time of the last&amp;nbsp;planning run. Changes that are made after the planning date are not taken into consideration, so the list is&amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;static&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;planning situation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;takes all changes in stock, receipts and issues that occur between planning runs into account (as in the&amp;nbsp;stock/requirements list). The&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;planning result&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;displays the result of the last planning run (as in the&amp;nbsp;MRP list). The main difference is that you set up a&amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;special evaluation layout&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the formatting of the data in the planning result and planning situation. This layout defines which receipt and issue elements are displayed at which level of aggregation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;MRP Live&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; is used, and we also have the MRP Cockpit Fiori Apps and the MPR Situation Handling. MRP Lists are gone with MRP Live due to the considerable performance improvement. The several available MRP Cockpit Fiori Apps display an overview of materials with possible stock shortages, and you can also drill down into a specific material to see the stock/requirements situation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new Fiori Apps for MRP evaluation are more visually appealing, and they contain features only available in Fiori, such as Demand-Driven MRP (DDMRP) and Predictive MRP (pMRP). Moreover, they are also supported in mobile devices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On below table you can find a summary of the abovementioned MRP transactions or Fiori Apps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Description&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transaction MD04&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Display Individual Stock/Requirements Situation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transaction MD07&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Display Collective Stock/Requirements Situation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transaction MD05&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Individual Display of MRP List&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transaction MD06&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Collective Display of MRP List&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transaction MD44&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Planning Situation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transaction MD47&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Collective Display for Planning Situation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transaction MD45&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Planning Result&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transaction MD46&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Collective Display for Planning Result&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transaction MD48&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Multi-Plant Planning Situation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fiori App F0251A&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Manage Material Coverage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="136.997px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fiori App F2101A&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="340.99px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Monitor Material Coverage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Customer Requirement for a Collective Evaluation of the MRP Planning Results&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customer business case was a small-sized food company with mainly a mass production environment using discrete manufacturing. Main finished products were fresh products sent to retailers to be sold on the supermarket’s shelf. Therefore, demand was seasonal but also with a special focus on daily consumption pattern. &amp;nbsp;The customer was interested on running the MRP with &lt;U&gt;requirements based on forecast demand&lt;/U&gt;, but also considering the &lt;U&gt;historical consumption&lt;/U&gt; of the last four weeks per day, to have the whole picture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since it was just a small company, there were only two main MRP responsible for the whole of the planning process and availability control for purchasing products, intermediate production and final product production. The two main areas of responsibility were &lt;STRONG&gt;MPS products&lt;/STRONG&gt;, covering the final products to sale, and &lt;STRONG&gt;MRP products&lt;/STRONG&gt;, covering the products for purchasing and intermediate production. On this blog we will focus on the MRP products.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The customer used a &lt;STRONG&gt;make-to-stock production&lt;/STRONG&gt; (goods sold from stock) because of the following reasons:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The materials were produced independently of the sales orders.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The materials were not assigned to specific sales orders (not segregated).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Costs was required to be tracked at material level, and not at sales order level.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The main objective was to quickly provide the clients with goods from the stock. The &lt;U&gt;main constraint&lt;/U&gt; was that real sales orders were often received from clients only for one day, and normally with just one day in advance or even the same day. Therefore, customer needed to produce goods without having the sales orders, as expecting the clients demand in future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On this make-to-stock scenario, to avoid unreasonably high stock levels, a production plan is created in advance, and then you decide whether sales orders exceeding your plan are to affect production or not. Receiving sales orders as early as possible (using scheduling agreements, for example) also contributes to minimize high stock levels, but it was unrealistic on this customer, so a smooth demand forecast was key.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The production was determined by a &lt;STRONG&gt;production plan&lt;/STRONG&gt; based on &lt;STRONG&gt;demand forecast&lt;/STRONG&gt; (demand management), and only sales orders for first day exceeding the plan directly influenced production. If available, sales order information for subsequent days was required to be displayed for information purposes only (as normally info was uncompleted), but forecast was the demand driver except for the first day. Therefore, &lt;U&gt;planning strategy&lt;/U&gt; used was &lt;STRONG&gt;net requirements planning on plant level (strategy 10)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which allows to smooth the demand program.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another very important considerations of the customer for achieving an effective materials planning were the following:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer wanted to &lt;STRONG&gt;expedite material planning&lt;/STRONG&gt; with a more detailed collective material overview than the one provided by standard SAP S/4HANA MRP apps.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer requested to analyze materials on a &lt;STRONG&gt;dynamic periodic basis&lt;/STRONG&gt;, mainly &lt;STRONG&gt;daily&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but also &lt;STRONG&gt;weekly&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;monthly&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The operative planning is usually managed by day, meanwhile medium-term planning should be managed by week/month.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer requested a calculation of &lt;STRONG&gt;stock coverage&lt;/STRONG&gt; for every period displayed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer worked with &lt;STRONG&gt;two planning modes&lt;/STRONG&gt;: the &lt;U&gt;real-time mode&lt;/U&gt;, like MD04 with the&amp;nbsp;most up-to-date stock and requirements situation, and the &lt;U&gt;fix-photo mode&lt;/U&gt;, similar to MD05 (MRP-List) with a snapshot at the beginning of the day with the situation of initial stock, requirements and receipts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer did not plan materials at MRP areas level.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer needed a more &lt;STRONG&gt;flexible material selection&lt;/STRONG&gt; by using the typical grouping fields available on material master.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer needed a flexible visualization of quantities in &lt;STRONG&gt;several units of measure&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customer requirement for MRP monitoring was to build a new &lt;U&gt;collective tool to evaluate and manage the MRP results for multiple materials&lt;/U&gt;. On this tool, future requirements would be displayed together with historical data, thus allowing the customer to compare &lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;future needs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; with &lt;U&gt;past consumptions&lt;/U&gt; on the same period. Initial stock and final stock situation for every period based on total requirements and receipts were also required to be displayed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Final decision was to create two similar planning monitoring tools: one focused on MPS products, the MPS Production Planning Monitor, and other focused on MRP products, the MRP Purchasing Planning Monitor. On this blog we will focus on the &lt;STRONG&gt;MRP Purchasing Planning Monitor&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which is described in detail down below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Juan_Ventura_0-1756548936365.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306881i8D9D03371797EEA3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Juan_Ventura_0-1756548936365.png" alt="Juan_Ventura_0-1756548936365.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 1&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;: Material Scope for MRP Live run with MPS/MRP materials.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Purchasing Planning Monitor MRP&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Purchasing Planning Monitor MRP was intended for displaying the&amp;nbsp;stock/requirements/receipts situation for a particular or a series of materials, from the point of view of purchasing or intermediate production. The prerequisite was the MRP Live (operative production plan MPS &amp;amp; MRP) previously executed for the corresponding plant, and this was automatically done daily at night by a background job.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The evaluations on this Monitor display all&amp;nbsp;receipt and issue elements&amp;nbsp;for the materials in the form of a table and enable the planner to gain a quick&amp;nbsp;overview&amp;nbsp;of the stock/requirements/receipts situation for the material, as well as to branch into the detail list for the different MRP elements for this material. After a normal MPS&amp;amp;MRP run, the planner checks the stock/requirements/receipts situation for the materials, make necessary changes and ensures the availability of the materials for the next days, by creating purchase or production orders. The tool also allowed working by fixing the planning elements either purchase requisitions or planned orders, but customer planners used to directly create the purchase or production orders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As planners of this customer were old-school heavy users of SAP systems, this Monitor was developed in form of ALV list by using the BAPI_MATERIAL_STOCK_REQ_LIST function.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Selection Screen for Purchasing Planning Monitor MRP&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The selection screen of the new Purchasing Planning Monitor MRP tool is displayed on below image (Figure 2):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Juan_Ventura_1-1756548936369.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306882iA345BA572EE28529/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Juan_Ventura_1-1756548936369.png" alt="Juan_Ventura_1-1756548936369.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 2&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;: Selection Screen of the Purchasing Planning Monitor MRP tool.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The period to be considered must be selected using the fields “Date From” and “Date To”. One week is proposed by default.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Requirements/receipts can be shown by &lt;U&gt;day&lt;/U&gt;, by &lt;U&gt;week&lt;/U&gt; or by &lt;U&gt;month&lt;/U&gt;: this is managed by field “Period Type”. The operative planning (short-term planning) is usually managed by day, while medium-term planning should be managed by week/month.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The materials to be shown can be selected by material type, material group, MRP controller and/or material code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The default “Planning Mode” is executed by using the fix photo of the initial stock (“Planning Fix-Photo”). Using this mode the entire requirements of the day and the entire purchase orders are shown. The other mode is the online planning which uses the current available stock on real-time (“Planning Real-Time”). Using this other mode only the pending requirements of the day and the pending purchase orders are shown.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The quantities shown can be displayed on any unit of measure available in the materials. The monitor allows to select the base unit of measure of the material, the kilograms or an alternative unit of measure to be entered by the user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The total percentage of loss of the materials can be displayed as scrap (internal SAP), but also as drop or yield. This is just a percentage related to food processing to be considered by the planner during the evaluation process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The calculation of stock coverage on periods can be dynamically changed to consider or not the “-Expired stock” and the “+Purchases”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, consumption history can be shown together with MRP data, for 1 period only or for 4 periods.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Output List for Purchasing Planning Monitor MRP&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An example of the &lt;SPAN&gt;output list of the new Purchasing Planning Monitor MRP tool is displayed on below image (Figure 3):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Juan_Ventura_2-1756548936416.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306883i8F4D13C08C4A52C4/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Juan_Ventura_2-1756548936416.png" alt="Juan_Ventura_2-1756548936416.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 3&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;: Output List of the Purchasing Planning Monitor MRP tool.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This new monitoring tool allows to display at the same time the following data:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;U&gt;MRP planning results&lt;/U&gt; over sales &amp;amp; forecast (future).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;U&gt;Consumption history&lt;/U&gt; (past).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The MRP evaluation on this Monitor displays all&amp;nbsp;receipt and issue elements&amp;nbsp;for every material in the form of a table and enable the planner to gain a quick&amp;nbsp;overview&amp;nbsp;of the stock/requirements/receipts situation for the material. Moreover, for every period the historical consumption for the material is shown for the fourth previous periods, and also the average. This allows the planner to compare future needs with past consumptions on the same period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Requirements are shown in negative - quantity and receipts in positive + quantity, in order to ease the coverage understanding.

The default planning mode is executed by using the fix photo of the initial stock (“Planning Fix-Photo”). Using this mode, the entire requirements of the day and the entire receipts (purchase and manufacturing) are shown. The other mode is the online planning which uses the current available stock on real-time (“Planning Real-Time”). Using this other mode, only the pending requirements of the day and the pending purchase/manufacturing orders are shown.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Juan_Ventura_13-1756548936650.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306893i10B631D640B17B2E/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Juan_Ventura_13-1756548936650.png" alt="Juan_Ventura_13-1756548936650.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 14&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;: Output List of the Monitor for the different Planning Modes.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Juan_Ventura_14-1756548936681.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306894iD9649B91D37A2EC5/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Juan_Ventura_14-1756548936681.png" alt="Juan_Ventura_14-1756548936681.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 15&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;: Output List with Details for the different Planning Modes.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The monitor can display the quantities on any unit of measure available in the materials. The monitor allows to select the base unit of measure of the material, the kilograms or an alternative unit of measure to be entered by the user. This can be done either on the selection screen or directly on the main screen, as well as the planning mode.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Juan_Ventura_15-1756548936704.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306898iB1438B96B76445A3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Juan_Ventura_15-1756548936704.png" alt="Juan_Ventura_15-1756548936704.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 16&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;: Output List of the Monitor showing quantities in different units of measure.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, the Monitor can display the total percentage of loss of the materials as scrap, like standard SAP, but also as drop or yield. This is just a percentage related to food processing loss, but very relevant for the planner when taking purchase decisions during the evaluation process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Juan_Ventura_16-1756548936714.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306896i272DBBD7A30342A7/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Juan_Ventura_16-1756548936714.png" alt="Juan_Ventura_16-1756548936714.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 17&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;: Output List of the Monitor showing total percentage of loss by different ways.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Action Buttons for Purchasing Planning Monitor MRP&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Monitor has an action button to create a new purchase order. Furthermore, on the different screens with the details list of receipts, when clicking on the purchase or production order, the monitor navigates to the corresponding maintenance application, where the user can directly edit the date and/or the quantity. This considerably improves the number of clicks required to perform those actions compared to use new modes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Juan_Ventura_0-1756549800706.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306901i4D91CEBF7720DB91/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Juan_Ventura_0-1756549800706.png" alt="Juan_Ventura_0-1756549800706.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 18&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;: Output List of the Monitor with the action button “Create New Purchase Order”.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Helpful Links&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/fe39e10a9a864a8f8dc9537704f0fa13/a084b853dcfcb44ce10000000a174cb4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Materials Requirements Planning (SAP Help Portal)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/fe39e10a9a864a8f8dc9537704f0fa13/6c24c55368511f4be10000000a174cb4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Evaluating the Planning Run (SAP Help Portal)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;[&lt;STRONG&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Written by Juan Ventura (&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/juanventurasap" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt;).

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP field service management operations set up for any new company settings requires careful planning, which has become much easier with the help of built in cloud AI features. With the help of these smart tools companies in FSM helps with much better decision making. Which also helps the technicians to complete their work more efficiently since they will be getting real-time support, faster &amp;amp; for instance access to the information which they require and smart scheduling. This results in lesser delays, and much improved service quality.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Prerequisites for SAP Cloud FSM: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Must have a valid license for&amp;nbsp;SAP AI Units.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Premium AI features must be activated in FSM tenant.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sufficient Historical Data (1000 activities with the execution Stage should be equal to&amp;nbsp;CLOSE status in order to train the system)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key AI Features in SAP FSM:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Below is the breakdown of the core AI functionalities available&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Intelligent Filtering&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Assignment Duration Prediction&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Activity Summary&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Equipment Summary&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;-&amp;gt; Intelligent Filtering:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Intelligent Filtering will help by showing the&amp;nbsp;most relevant technicians only for the job and automatically sorting. which is like having a smart assistant that understands the input.&amp;nbsp;Instead of checking each customer manually system will sort them based on the requirements of the job, then you will be getting a list of customers who passed the requirements which leads to lesser time consumption and better accuracy.&lt;BR /&gt;For example, imagine you're a dispatcher in FSM who is trying to assign a technician to a service job, you have list of technicians, but not all of them are suitable for all tasks, some might be far away, some might not be having the right skills, and others might already busy with other service jobs assigned previously. so based on the below points we can perform the intelligent filtering.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What the job needs (Like skills, tools, etc.)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Which technicians are available to perform the service task&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Who is nearby&amp;nbsp;to perform the service task&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Who has done the similar job well previously.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Why It’s Useful:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lesser time consumption: No need to manually check the list of all customers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduced errors: Selects only technicians who are qualified and are available.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Improved customer service: Faster and better matches which results in the quicker resolutions for the tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Steps to Enable:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Raise an Incident:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Go to your SAP support portal.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a request under the component:&amp;nbsp;CEC-SRV-FSM-AI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mention that you have a valid license and want to activate&amp;nbsp;Intelligent Filtering.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Will Enable the Feature:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Once the request is processed, SAP will activate the feature in your FSM environment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Verify in the FSM Portal:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigate to the&amp;nbsp;Planning &amp;amp; Dispatching&amp;nbsp;module.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You’ll see technician suggestions ranked intelligently when assigning service calls.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shreya_C_K_0-1755700541606.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303002i213805EAA75881BF/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Shreya_C_K_0-1755700541606.png" alt="Shreya_C_K_0-1755700541606.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Compared to the older&amp;nbsp;Best Matching Technician plugin,&amp;nbsp;Intelligent Filtering&amp;nbsp;is smarter and much easier to use. The old plugin works based on business rules which has been set up for every company, like checking technician skills or distance. whereas Intelligent Filtering in FSM uses the AI&amp;nbsp;to understand what exactly dispatcher is looking for in the technicians and it automatically suggests the best technicians available for the service task.&amp;nbsp; It is much faster, that means it supports&amp;nbsp;natural language searches. And it also gives the extra insights like past equipment history (which is not available in the old plugin doesn’t offer).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Assignment Duration Prediction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Assignment Duration Prediction can be seen during the dispatching of an activity which will provide the overview like how long it will take to complete the current service task, which technician will be suitable for this activity rather than dispatcher guessing how long it might take to complete the current service tasks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;It uses the data like below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The&amp;nbsp;type of service task which needs to be assigned&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The&amp;nbsp;technician’s past performance on the service tasks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Historical data which are similar to the current service task&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Job priority and some other requirements&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This will help the dispatchers to plan accurately and helps to avoid the delay.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Why It’s Useful:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Better scheduling: can avoid the overloading the technicians.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lesser delays during the assignment of service tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Steps to Enable:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Training the (AI Model) system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;You can do this in two easy ways:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Option A: Use the Settings Screen&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Go to&amp;nbsp;Settings and Configuration&amp;nbsp;in FSM.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click on&amp;nbsp;Assignment Duration Prediction.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select your training data and click&amp;nbsp;Train.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shreya_C_K_1-1755700541614.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303001iC813040515B7A137/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Shreya_C_K_1-1755700541614.png" alt="Shreya_C_K_1-1755700541614.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Option B: Use a Sample Business Rule&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Download the sample rule from SAP Help.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Upload it to your FSM system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Add your technical contact and adjust the date range if needed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Run the rule to train the model.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Activate the Feature&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Go to: Settings and Configuration → Planning and Dispatching → General Settings → Activity Planning → Additional Settings&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Turn on the checkbox:&lt;BR /&gt;“Allow assignment duration prediction for semi and fully automated scheduling”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Start Using It&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use features like&amp;nbsp;Auto-Scheduling&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;Best Matching Technician.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The system will now use&amp;nbsp;predicted durations&amp;nbsp;instead of planned ones when assigning jobs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I will share the details of the issue, troubleshooting steps, and the solution that helped me resolve&amp;nbsp; the long running phase: PREP_IMPORT/TOOLIMP_I during conversion in SUM tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During a recent &lt;STRONG&gt;ECC to SAP S/4HANA 2023 conversion&lt;/STRONG&gt; project using &lt;STRONG&gt;DMOVE to S/4 using DoDMO&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we encountered a major performance bottleneck.&lt;BR /&gt;The SUM phase &lt;STRONG&gt;PREP_IMPORT/TOOLIMP_I&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which typically should not take very long, ended up running for more than &lt;STRONG&gt;30 hours&lt;/STRONG&gt; without completing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Source system:&lt;/STRONG&gt; ECC 6 EHP 8 on DB2 v11.5.9.0&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Target system:&lt;/STRONG&gt; S/4HANA 2023 FPS01&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SUM version:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SUM 2.0 SP23&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Method:&lt;/STRONG&gt; DMOVE to S/4 using DoDMO&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OS version&lt;/STRONG&gt;: SLES 15 SP05 (both Source and target)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The conversion was progressing smoothly until the phase &lt;STRONG&gt;PREP_IMPORT/TOOLIMP_I&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Issue:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the conversion, &lt;STRONG&gt;Software Update Manager (SUM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; entered the phase &lt;STRONG&gt;PREP_IMPORT/TOOLIMP_I&lt;/STRONG&gt; and it was running very slow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This phase is part of the &lt;STRONG&gt;preparation import&lt;/STRONG&gt; steps and is mainly responsible for:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Importing tool-related transport objects into the shadow system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;These objects are necessary for SUM to run subsequent phases.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It typically involves &lt;STRONG&gt;R3trans&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;tp&lt;/STRONG&gt; calls that execute DDIC and tool transports.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Expected Behavior&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Normally, this step should finish within &lt;STRONG&gt;a few min to hour&lt;/STRONG&gt; (depending on system size and DB performance).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The logs (TOOLIMP_I.LOG) should show a sequence of transport requests being imported with steady progress.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How we Overcame the Issue&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After confirming that the &lt;STRONG&gt;TOOLIMP_I&lt;/STRONG&gt; phase was progressing extremely slowly with no obvious system bottleneck, I decided to take corrective action. Below are the exact steps that resolved the issue.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Terminate Processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Killed all &lt;STRONG&gt;R3trans&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;tp put&lt;/STRONG&gt; processes running on the &lt;STRONG&gt;Additional Application Server (AAS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; where SUM was initiated.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Also killed the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAPup&lt;/STRONG&gt; process on the AAS to terminate the running phase PREP_IMPORT/TOOLIMP_I.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ensure DIR_PUT Consistency&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The parameter &lt;STRONG&gt;DIR_PUT&lt;/STRONG&gt; (checked in transaction RZ11) must be consistent between the &lt;STRONG&gt;Primary Application Server (PAS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and the AAS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Example: DIR_PUT = /usr/sap/&amp;lt;SID&amp;gt;/SUM/abap&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;In my case, SUM was started from a different mount point on AAS:&lt;BR /&gt;/Migration/SUM&lt;BR /&gt;To fix this, I created a &lt;STRONG&gt;soft link&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; under /usr/sap/&amp;lt;SID&amp;gt;/SUM pointing to the /Migration/SUM directory.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Copy SUM Directory&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Copied the entire SUM directory from the &lt;STRONG&gt;AAS&lt;/STRONG&gt; to PAS on below location&lt;BR /&gt;/usr/sap/&amp;lt;SID&amp;gt;/&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adjust TOOLIMPI.TPP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Edit the file: /usr/sap/&amp;lt;SID&amp;gt;/SUM/abap/var/TOOLIMPI.TPP on the PAS and make sure its points correctly to PAS folders and files.

By carefully analyzing SUM behavior, ensuring environment consistency, and using controlled manual intervention, I was able to resolve an issue that had stalled for more than 30 hours and guide SUM back on track. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding SUM’s internal processes, maintaining flexibility in troubleshooting, and always preparing for unexpected challenges during complex system conversions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks &amp;amp; Regards&lt;BR /&gt;Abhinav Mitra&lt;BR /&gt;SAP Technology Consultant&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This article is part of a series exploring SAP's Selective Data Transition Engagement (SDTE). In a &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-members/accelerate-your-sap-s-4hana-journey-with-selective-data-transition/ba-p/14143295" target="_self"&gt;previous blog&lt;/A&gt;, we provided an overview and the main value drivers of the SDT transition approach. In this article, we will discuss the optimal selection of an SDT scenario. Upcoming instalments will delve into methodology, tools, and more to clarify SDTE and showcase its benefits.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1605058986"&gt;Transformation requirements&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enterprises operating on SAP ERP and considering a transition to SAP S/4HANA may have varying starting points and needs. Some may see the transition as a move to the next generation of software with minimal changes in system functionality and data. Others may use the SAP S/4HANA transition to revamp their system's foundation to better support current and future business needs, eliminating obsolete data and developments while introducing new features and innovations. Transformation requirements often depend on:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How long ago and how optimally the SAP ERP systems were implemented, and how significantly business models, structures, and processes have changed since then.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How prepared the current systems are to support business strategy, growth, and innovations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The roadmap chosen by the enterprise for transformation, including investments planned before, during, and after the transition to SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Selective Data Transition provides the flexibility to incorporate desired changes within the scope of the SAP S/4HANA transition project, encompassing multiple transition scenarios rather than one. Different scenarios may be optimal for different enterprises based on transformation and data migration requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ildar_akhmerov2_15-1751531340546.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282093iD88E686C486BA9AD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ildar_akhmerov2_15-1751531340546.png" alt="ildar_akhmerov2_15-1751531340546.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the following sections, we will explore these scenarios and discuss how to select the most suitable one for your specific requirements. We'll begin with an overview of options for creating the target system and then examine various data migration scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1408545481"&gt;Target system creation&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every SDT project begins with the decision on how the target SAP S/4HANA system will be created. The target system, also known as the "golden shell" or "golden template," is a system created at the start of the SDT project. It serves as the foundation for all systems within the SAP S/4HANA project and maintenance landscapes, including the future productive system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1341114695"&gt;Option 1. Shell conversion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first option, "shell conversion," is suitable if most of your current SAP ERP assets (configured solutions, developments, data) need to be preserved and transitioned to SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ildar_akhmerov2_16-1751531340553.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282091i4BFE378FBD9F011D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ildar_akhmerov2_16-1751531340553.png" alt="ildar_akhmerov2_16-1751531340553.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Using a client copy or specific tools, create an empty copy of SAP ECC with all customizing and repository (code) but without any application data. This system is called the "SAP ECC shell."&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Perform required housekeeping activities in the empty SAP ECC shell system, such as removing unnecessary company codes. Unicode conversion or upgrades may be completed to meet system conversion prerequisites if required.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Execute all activities necessary to prepare this system for conversion to SAP S/4HANA (data preparation is not required since there is no data in the system).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Convert the prepared SAP ECC shell to SAP S/4HANA using a standard conversion toolset and complete SPAU, SPDD and post-conversion activities. This system becomes the "golden shell" of SAP S/4HANA—a template for all future SAP S/4HANA systems, created as copies of the golden shell.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Implement custom code adjustments and customizing changes required for simplification items or additional business requirements in the development system (a copy of the golden shell).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Necessary data can be migrated to the copy of the configured system. More details on data migration scenarios described below.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1144601190"&gt;Option 2. Mix and Match&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second option is suitable when most processes require modifications, and it becomes necessary to substantially reimplement the system. This approach supports these changes while retaining certain investments, such as configured solutions, developments, and data, for the transition to SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this scenario, a new SAP S/4HANA system is deployed, with standard content activated as necessary. Unlike a greenfield implementation, the target system will be enhanced by transferring selected elements from SAP ECC or an intermediate ECC system. This enhancement is supported by specialized tools.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ildar_akhmerov2_17-1751531340559.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282092i0EF93F081E68B609/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ildar_akhmerov2_17-1751531340559.png" alt="ildar_akhmerov2_17-1751531340559.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The most common scenarios are illustrated in the image above.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-948087685"&gt;Option 3. Special case – Systems Consolidation&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When it is necessary to consolidate multiple SAP ECC systems into a single instance of SAP S/4HANA, and there are significant similarities among the ECC systems, variations of options 1 and 2 can be utilized to create the target system, depending on specific requirements. A typical scenario is as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select one of the consolidated systems as the main target.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create an SAP ECC shell from this system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Compare customization and repository of this SAP ECC shell with all the SAP ECC systems that will be consolidated manually or using specific tools, highlighting any identified differences.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Analyze the differences and document how to resolve conflicts, collecting mappings between settings in the source and target systems to be used in the later data migration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Consolidate customizing and repositories in the SAP ECC shell system manually or using special tools based on documented decisions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Prepare the consolidated SAP ECC shell for conversion to SAP S/4HANA and convert it into the golden shell of SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the target system is ready, an SAP S/4HANA development system is usually created as a copy to perform necessary application-specific customizing and custom-code adjustments. Completion of these prepares the system for data migration and testing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-622491461"&gt;SDT Scenarios Overview&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SDT scenarios described below represent best practices commonly used in SDTE community projects. Even if the terms or names may slightly vary among different partners, the meaning and practices remain consistent within the community. After creating the target SAP S/4HANA system, finding an optimal path for data migration addressing specific requirements is essential.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-555060675"&gt;Scenario 1. Regular SDT – table-based data migration and transformation&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this scenario, selected SAP ERP system data is migrated to SAP S/4HANA at the database table level using specialized tools. Specific considerations include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Target system creation is preferably achieved via the shell conversion.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Table-based migration enables fast data transfer, resulting in short downtime since migration occurs at the database level. Unlike posting based technology (e.g. Migration Cockpit) no application-level logic is executed for the data migration, thus careful data validation and process testing is crucial post-migration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Required transformation routines are executed in the SAP S/4HANA target system post or during migration to transform the data into the SAP S/4HANA data model.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Historical transactional data can be migrated using this approach, with filters applicable based on organizational units (e.g., data for selected company codes) or time slices (e.g., the last three years of data), or individual filters for data migration objects. Data cleansing and preparation of the migrated data in source systems may be needed (for example consistency of finance historical data).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Go-live can be scheduled at any time during the fiscal year, as all necessary data for finance reporting is usually migrated, avoiding data slicing between systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Downtime for source and target systems is usually required during the table-based migration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Transformations can be applied to migrated data based on mappings, renaming, or renumbering logic. Some S/4HANA transformation pre-projects (e.g., Business Partners creation) may be embedded in the SDT migration process. However, limitations may exist on integrating many "on-the-fly" transformations simultaneously on the same data set at the same time.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-358547170"&gt;Scenario 2. Lean SDT – selective table-based data migration without transformation requirements&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Lean Selective Data Transition is the standard solution provided by SAP for identifying and transferring relevant data during migration from SAP ECC to SAP S/4HANA using the SAP Business Transformation Center. Technically, Lean SDT resembles Option 1: shell creation is necessary, and all data migrates at the table level with organizational unit or time slice filters. However, Lean SDT offers no data transformations and no systems consolidation, whereas regular SDT provides more flexibility and broader transformation possibilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-162033665"&gt;Scenario 3. Hybrid SDT – combination of table-based data migration &amp;amp; postings&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this scenario, selected SAP ERP data for specific areas (e.g., master data, logistics, plant maintenance) migrated to SAP S/4HANA at the database table level using special tools, while postings (using tools like SAP Migration Cockpit or specific consulting tools) are used for other data objects (e.g., finance open items, balances, and inventory stocks). Specific considerations include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Postings trigger application-level validations of migrated data, increasing confidence in data quality within the target system. However, postings may take longer than table-based migration and require higher data cleansing standards.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Historical transactional data cannot be migrated using standard posting methodologies. Only current open orders, open items, balances, and stocks can be transferred to the target instance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Go-live is advisable at the beginning of the fiscal year, as data needed for finance reporting may be sliced between systems otherwise, impacting migration scope and efforts (P&amp;amp;L, assets).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Postings occur through data re-creation using API (BAPI) in the target system considering local system settings. Therefore, postings provide a simplified option to redesign functional and structural changes, at the expense of loss of historical data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--163562559"&gt;SDT Scenario Selection&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Selecting an optimal SDT scenario is primarily driven by transformation and data migration requirements and includes decisions on the target system creation option and data migration approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Decision on a target system creation option depends on the changes needed in the system functionality and structures. This influences the scope of the transformation. The shell creation approach predominantly reuses current SAP ERP system customizing and repository, indicating that migrated data mostly fits the new system as it is in the source. The Mix and Match approach suggests that primarily spot solutions will remain unchanged in the future SAP S/4HANA compared to the current SAP ERP, starting from a new fresh system reducing the data migration scope/volume and increasing complexity of transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To select an optimal data migration strategy, it is essential to identify, at least at a high level, the mandatory and desired functional and structural changes (transformations) that will occur in the new SAP S/4HANA system compared to the existing SAP ERP. This question is closely related to data migration scope. Migrating historical transactional data means all required transformations must occur within this data, which can be complex and challenging for certain transformations and data objects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ildar_akhmerov2_18-1751531340567.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282095iCA54353968C63DA4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ildar_akhmerov2_18-1751531340567.png" alt="ildar_akhmerov2_18-1751531340567.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Project risks, efforts, and duration can be managed with a balanced approach between functional transformations and data migration scope. If functional transformations are driven by changes in business models and processes, they cannot usually be sacrificed and must be executed during the SAP S/4HANA transition. In such cases, data migration scope can be limited to postings of master data and open items to new structures in heavily transformed areas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Other factors influencing scenario selection include planned go-live date (beginning of fiscal year or not), systems consolidation needs, data volumes, downtime requirements, and potential for transformational pre- or post-projects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ildar_akhmerov2_19-1751531340577.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282094i3D53E627ADE90CD2/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ildar_akhmerov2_19-1751531340577.png" alt="ildar_akhmerov2_19-1751531340577.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To summarize, selecting the optimal SDT scenario requires knowledge of:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mandatory and desired functional and structural changes (transformations) in the new SAP S/4HANA system compared to the existing SAP ERP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Required data migration scope in different areas (Finance, Logistics/Operation, HR).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Downtime, go-live date, system consolidation, and other special requirements.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These topics must be discussed all together since they influence each other. A balanced approach might be required to select the most optimal SDT scenario that will provide the safest, easiest, and fastest pathway to SAP S/4HANA target architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-409664019"&gt;Success Stories&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--667058507"&gt;German manufacturer in the food sector: Selective Data Transition of the last 2 years&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The customer moved document date from the last two years from his old ECC into S/4HANA environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SDTE Properties in Action:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Shell creation: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Technical preparation of the future S/4HANA target system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Filtered selection: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Time slice level to just bring the necessary organizational structures with current and last two fiscal year into the new environment&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SDT transformation approach:&lt;/STRONG&gt; CO area restructuring (mainly merging, but also some splits), chart of accounts harmonization, introduction of New GL and New Asset Accounting, introduction of group currency&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--863572012"&gt;Energy Industry (Germany): Selective Data Transition with filtered migration&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The customer moved from his 20-year-old SAP ECC into a new SAP S/4HANA environment including a separation of energy industry specific data (SAP IS-U) from core ERP logistic and finance data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SDTE Properties in Action:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Shell creation: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Technical preparation of the future S/4HANA target system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Filtered selection: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Filter on organizational and time slice level to just bring the necessary organizational structures with current and last fiscal year into the new environment&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SDT transformation approach:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Regular SDT including transformations like a controlling area split and bringing the data into the S/4HANA data model&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--179876496"&gt;Call to Action&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;You’ve seen that selecting an optimal SDT scenario is primarily driven by transformation and data migration scope requirements and includes decisions on the target system creation option and data migration approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the next episode, we will discuss the advantages of systems consolidation and SDT usage for that purpose.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the meantime:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Explore Webinars &amp;amp; Resources&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Discover more about SDTE via official SAP Support Portal webinars or community sessions that dive deeper into the specifics.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Contact the SDTE Community&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Reach out to the expert group of SAP and its partners for an assessment of your current landscape.
