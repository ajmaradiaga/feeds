    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a fundamental component throughout the entire lifecycle of SAP products, including development, planning, and quality assurance. For &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP manages infrastructure-level security such as network protection, operating system security, and patch management. Security responsibilities requiring business-specific decisions—such as user and authorization management—are handled by the customer. In certain cases, SAP provides secure default configurations, which customers can adjust to suit specific business or integration requirements. Overall, SAP covers key security domains at the platform level, while customers are responsible for application-level security and configuration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have now added new &lt;STRONG&gt;Security and Data Protection Guidelines&lt;/STRONG&gt; within the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition (3-system landscape)&lt;/STRONG&gt; Roadmap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As an introduction to &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Activate Methodology&lt;/STRONG&gt;, The SAP Activate Roadmaps is a comprehensive, phase-based guide designed to support implementation, conversion, and upgrade projects by defining tasks, deliverables, responsibilities, and accelerators across six key phases: &lt;STRONG&gt;Discover&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Prepare&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Explore&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Realize&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Deploy&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;Run&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It provides methodology guidance, clear role and task allocation, and a rich set of accelerators such as templates and checklists to streamline activities like system provisioning, data migration, and cutover planning. Regularly updated to align with SAP’s quarterly cloud releases, the roadmap also offers specialized paths for system conversions and upgrades, and integrates with SAP Cloud ALM to enable real-time task management, progress tracking, and agile project execution, ensuring efficient and best-practice-driven project delivery.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is an overview of the topics and guidelines covered in each of the phases from a Security &amp;amp; Data Protection perspective&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prepare: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review the recommendations that help you evaluate the security of the configuration of&amp;nbsp;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&amp;nbsp;in your landscape. As part of the cloud shared responsibility model(restricted access), you're responsible for determining if any of these recommendations are relevant to your environment and to what extent.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integrate security recommendations into the overall implementation strategy, ensuring that the security plan comprehensively covers the following areas:&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Implementation Aspects – including evaluation of integration security posture, frontend protection planning, and authentication design;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Recurring Topics – such as certificate management planning, security monitoring setup, user lifecycle management design, and planning for the security and patching of external software.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These topics are critical to establishing a secure, compliant, and well-governed SAP S/4HANA Cloud environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Explore:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Conduct Data Protection Workshop&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;Define and confirm the implementation scope and configuration settings related to data protection and privacy, ensuring compliance with both general and industry-specific legal requirements. The workshop focuses on understanding SAP’s data protection concepts, identifying relevant project areas such as application design, extensibility, integration, testing, data management, and analytics, and determining where data protection measures must be applied. Key outcomes include clarifying responsibilities, reviewing system configurations, defining data retention policies, and ensuring transparency over personal data processing. The result is a comprehensive plan that outlines required actions for data protection experts and stakeholders to ensure secure and compliant system operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Plan and Design Identity and Access Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;Plan and design the Identity and Access Management (IAM) framework for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, ensuring proper authorization and secure access to applications. This involves consolidating business requirements captured during fit-to-standard workshops, defining a clear authorization concept with naming conventions, specifying required workplaces, and mapping SAP applications and business catalogs to these workplaces. All technical IAM details must be collected, documented, and approved by the customer. The authorization concept should ensure data integrity, protection against misuse, and be transparent enough for third-party verification. The finalized IAM framework also supports test planning and execution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Realize:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Initial access to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Tenants&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;Setup Integration to Corporate IdP if needed by setting up the SAP Cloud Identity Authentication Service as a proxy. Configure password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) in your IdP (Identity Authentication service or corporate IdP)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure data protection and privacy features based on the design defined during the Fit-to-Standard workshop. Key steps include defining data controllers, setting retention and residence policies for transactional and master data, managing security audit log retention, and maintaining purposes for information retrieval. Additionally, configure read access logging and consent administration if applicable.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Implement Frontend Security settings focusing on web client protection measures&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review and adapt existing Business Catalogs and Business Roles resulting from the addition of new scope items or an upgrade&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure Identity and Access Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;This task involves creating, configuring, and testing custom business roles based on approved identity and access management requirements. It includes assigning business catalogs and restriction field values according to the Application-Workplace List, creating test users, and ensuring roles cover all necessary access through completeness and negative testing. Authorization testing is coordinated across business areas, with roles refined and validated based on feedback.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deploy:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Finalize and validate all security configurations and data protection measures before the system goes live&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Run:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Security Operations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;Maintain system security, compliance, and audit readiness through continuous activities defined in the Prepare phase. Key ongoing operations include regular log monitoring (covering business data changes, user and role changes, and security audits), periodic reviews of Identity and Access Management for business and communication users, and proactive certificate management to prevent expirations and manage trust lists. Additionally, configuration monitoring is performed to ensure system integrity, collectively supporting a secure and compliant SAP environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use the tag &lt;STRONG&gt;Security-Data Protection-IAM&lt;/STRONG&gt; to access&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security, Data Protection and IAM content&lt;/STRONG&gt; in &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/roadmapviewer/group/658F507A-D6F5-4B78-9EE1-0300C5F1E40F/roadmapcontentpage/82b2db84548d41209cda972f0fac428b:t4" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition (3-system landscape)&lt;/A&gt; Roadmap&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Security and Data Privacy - Activate.png" style="width: 569px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/277939iED6327B1A8658010/image-dimensions/569x450?v=v2" width="569" height="450" role="button" title="Security and Data Privacy - Activate.png" alt="Security and Data Privacy - Activate.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can explore more SAP Activate resources in SAP Community using tag&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/topics/activate" target="_blank"&gt;#sapactivate&lt;/A&gt;, we also encourage you to consider following our sister communities SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP Cloud ALM.

    <title>How to get 10000 developers to securely deliver their software</title>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;P&gt;Let’s start with a few numbers: SAP S/4HANA contains more than 300 million lines of code, the software runs more than 90% of the world’s largest corporations and, most importantly for the scope of this article, it currently keeps about 10.000 developers at SAP busy. Those developers are spread all over the globe, covering pretty much every time zone. In this challenging setup, how do you ensure the secure delivery of software? Short answer: transparency. Long answer: continue reading.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Obviously, the answer is more complex than that. In order to ensure the security of a software that complex with that many developers in a decentralized setup, quite a few measures have to be in place in order to ensure securely written code and applications. These issues are addressed by SAP, as we have implemented a „shift-Left“ approach to security early on, including a product standard for security, a secure development and operations lifecycle (we need to secure our cloud environments, too), and, of course various tools and trainings to support developers in developing secure code in the first place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nevertheless, with 10.000 people working on the code daily, overseeing the security posture of the written code can be challenging, to say the least. This is why we have come up with the „Security Execution Dashboard“. At this point, we have to make a confession: there’s not much new stuff in the dashboard – but as with a lot of good things, it’s the combination of existing features and functions that make the dashboard so powerful – and is one of the reasons it won the prestigious CSO50 award this year, making it the second year in a row that SAP was able to win this particular award. Let’s deep dive into what made the security execution dashboard award-winning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the biggest technical hurdles was the sheer diversity of tools involved. SAP’s security landscape includes a mix of industry-standard scanners like GitHub, Blackduck, and Checkmarx, as well as SAP’s own tools like FioriDAST. Each of these tools speaks its own language—different data formats, different APIs, different update cycles. To make sense of this chaos, the team built a unified data extraction framework. Think of it as a translator that sits between the dashboard and each tool, standardizing the way data is pulled, parsed, and processed. Every tool got its own connector or adapter, ensuring that no matter how the data looked coming in, it would be clean and consistent going out.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But pulling the data was only half the battle. The next challenge was making it meaningful. Security data is only useful if it’s tied to the right team, the right product, and the right release. That meant building a harmonized data model that could map scan results to specific areas of responsibility. This wasn’t just a matter of matching names—it required defining mapping rules, building validation mechanisms, and ensuring that the same issue wasn’t counted twice or missed entirely. The result is a dashboard that doesn’t just show you what’s wrong—it shows you who needs to fix it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Performance was another sticking point. Querying live data from all these tools in real time would have brought the system to its knees. So the team implemented caching and temporary in-memory storage to keep things fast and responsive. Frequently accessed data is now stored locally, reducing the load on source systems and ensuring that developers aren’t left waiting for their dashboards to load.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data quality also proved to be a recurring issue. In the early days, scan results were often misattributed or incomplete, making it hard to trust the insights. To fix this, the team introduced a robust data quality management process. Automated validation checks, regular audits, and feedback loops with tool owners helped tighten the accuracy of the data and improve the reliability of team mappings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And then there was the human side. Convincing thousands of developers to adopt a new tool—especially one that shines a light on security gaps—is no small feat. The team tackled this with a mix of early engagement, pilot programs, and a strong internal communications push. Over time, the dashboard earned its place as the go-to source for security insights, not by mandate, but by proving its value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, the Security Execution Dashboard is more than just a reporting tool. It’s a living system that adapts to the needs of SAP’s engineering teams. It’s fast, it’s accurate, and it’s deeply integrated into the way SAP builds software. And most importantly, it’s helped shift the conversation around security—from something that happens after the fact, to something that’s embedded from the very first line of code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1734053448"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introduction&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI is SAP’s solution for &lt;STRONG&gt;secure authentication and single sign-on in SAP GUI scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The service is based on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) and supports the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/resilience-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery?version=Cloud" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;platform capabilities for high availability&lt;/A&gt; (HA).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In most cases this will be sufficient for customers, in particular as SAP Secure Login Service is only required during an end-user’s initial authentication of the day. When this is successful, an X.509 certificate is deployed on the end-user desktop, which gives her single sign-on, usually for the rest of the working day. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Still, some customers would like to go beyond the standard HA capabilities and instead &lt;STRONG&gt;implement a dedicated, multi-region failover setup&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this blog, I will describe the steps that are necessary to configure this setup. It is based on SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI, SAP Custom Domain service and Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager. Many thanks to Microsoft’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/171519"&gt;@MartinRaepple&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for helping me get started with Traffic Manager. This blog is yet another outcome of our great collaboration over the years &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1537539943"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Setting up SAP Secure Login Service for multi-region failover&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SLS HA Setup.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/280678iC2ABAAF0553513B0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SLS HA Setup.png" alt="SLS HA Setup.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Subscribe to SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI from &lt;STRONG&gt;two SAP BTP subaccounts&lt;/STRONG&gt; in different regions, in the same global account. Let us assume that the two instances of SAP Secure Login Service have the URLs sls-customer.region1.cloud.sap and sls-customer.region2.cloud.sap.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In each region, configure the same &lt;STRONG&gt;custom domain&lt;/STRONG&gt; and map it to the local SAP Secure Login Service standard route. Let us assume that the custom domain has the URL sls.customer.com. For the custom domain to work, you also need to add the OpenID Connect redirect URIs in SAP Cloud Identity Services – Identity Authentication.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Introduce a traffic management solution. In this example, we use &lt;STRONG&gt;Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Let us assume that the Traffic Manager profile has the URL sls.trafficmanager.net. Add the URLs of the two SAP Secure Login Service instances as endpoints to the Traffic Manager profile.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure the &lt;STRONG&gt;routing method&lt;/STRONG&gt;, based on which Traffic Manager will switch end points. For testing, you might use the priority of the end points, which means that the switch takes place if you change the priority in the Traffic Manager configuration. In a productive scenario, you would choose technical indicators of availability, such as performance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Traffic Manager will automatically configure the DNS record of sls.trafficmanager.net to point to the optimal endpoint, based on the routing method. Let us assume that in the beginning this is region 1.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Configure the DNS record of your custom domain&lt;/STRONG&gt; sls.customer.com so that it points to the Traffic Manager URL sls.trafficmanager.net.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enter the custom domain sls.customer.com as the SAP Secure Login Service host name in &lt;STRONG&gt;Secure Login Client&lt;/STRONG&gt; on the end-user desktop.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1341026438"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1144512933"&gt;Handling of the failover case&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SLS HA FailOver.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/280680iAF4721A636DCE79B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SLS HA FailOver.png" alt="SLS HA FailOver.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-upper-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Let us assume that due to some technical reason, SAP Secure Login Service in region 1 becomes unresponsive.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Traffic Manager checks all endpoints at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds) and detects the issue.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Traffic Manager updates the DNS record for sls.trafficmanager.net to point to sls-customer.region2.cloud.sap.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The next time Secure Login Client connects to SAP Secure Login Service, the DNS name sls.customer.com is automatically resolved to point to the service instance in region 2.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-947999428"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-751485923"&gt;Further considerations&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog covers the high-availability setup of SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI. As SAP Secure Login Service relies on an identity provider for end-user authentication, this also needs to be available at runtime. SAP’s identity provider, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services – Identity Authentication, also offers a &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/disaster-recovery-high-availability" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;multi-region setup&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;If you use a 3rd party identity provider, check the documentation of that product to learn more about options for high availability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Secure Login Service issues end-user certificates that enable authentication for SAP NetWeaver ABAP-based systems such as SAP ERP and SAP S/4HANA. During authentication, the X.509 certificate is mapped to a user account in the ABAP system, if the SNC name of that user account matches the subject name of the certificate. In the default implementation of SAP Secure Login Service, information about the region becomes part of the subject name. As a result, switching to a different region breaks the mapping.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are &lt;STRONG&gt;two options to ensure that the SNC mapping remains intact&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use parameters of the SAP Cryptographic Library to &lt;STRONG&gt;strip the region names from the certificate subject&lt;/STRONG&gt; before the mapping takes place. That way, certificates from different regions will match the same SNC name. See note&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2338952" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2338952&lt;/A&gt; for details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Change the SAP Secure Login Service configuration to &lt;STRONG&gt;use a customer-managed certificate authority&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This gives you the option to customize the subject name of the certificate so that it does not include the BTP region.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-554972418"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-358458913"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Setting up SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI for multi-region failover is easy. All you need is SAP Custom Domain service and a traffic management solution such as Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager. Thanks to the flexibility of the configuration, end-users continue to benefit from single sign-on even if SAP Secure Login Service instances are switched in the background.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-161945408"&gt;More information&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information about our SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI solution and to stay up to date on the latest developments, visit &lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/single-sign-on" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;our topic page in SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Find your way to our central blog series entry&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-members/ultimate-blog-series-sap-logserv-integration-with-microsoft-sentinel/ba-p/14126401" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;here&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dear community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Following the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-logserv-integration-with-microsoft-sentinel-for-sap-rise-customers-is/ba-p/14085387" target="_blank"&gt;product release blog&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; by SAP regarding the integration of SAP LogServ and Microsoft Sentinel, I am going to share some details on the built-in detection rules and how you can build upon them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The most discussed log in my customer conversations so far was SAP HANA database. So, let’s start with that.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1605003314"&gt;Discover the available built-in detections from the Content Hub&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find the relevant section both from the Azure or the unified Defender portal under Rule templates in the Analytics section. They are available from version 3.0.2 of the SAP LogServ solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="MartinPankraz_0-1751377056812.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/281358iEBA01CB3C314647B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MartinPankraz_0-1751377056812.png" alt="MartinPankraz_0-1751377056812.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Typical database threat scenarios involve tampering with audit log settings, admin authorizations or privileged role assignments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have taken the existing battle-proven Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP rules for HANA DB and translated them to be compatible with the LogServ schema. The raw log source is Syslog in both cases. So, the only remaining step was “unboxing” of the JSON wrapper.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To understand the individual columns of the LogServ output, see SAP’s &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/b3ee5778bc2e4a089d3299b82ec762a7/0a57444d217649bf94a19c0b68b470cc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;HANA Audit Trail Layout for Trail Target documentation&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;. For ease of use we have numbered the columns and applied the same names SAP mentions on their docs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1408489809"&gt;Activate the new rules&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Navigate to the Analytics pane and select the rule you want, click “Create Rule” from the button with the three dots and follow the configuration wizard. See the severity classification and pre-defined MITRE attack framework mapping. These mappings help streamline your SOC analysts’ triage efforts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="MartinPankraz_1-1751377056832.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/281356i19AA2ACAEDEEFE09/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MartinPankraz_1-1751377056832.png" alt="MartinPankraz_1-1751377056832.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="MartinPankraz_2-1751377056849.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/281357i9EA86347E8241054/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MartinPankraz_2-1751377056849.png" alt="MartinPankraz_2-1751377056849.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Verify the rule execution schedule and consider automated responses where feasible. Creating ServiceNow tickets for instance is a popular action. See my &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-members/from-zero-to-hero-security-coverage-with-microsoft-sentinel-for-your/ba-p/13561790" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated blog series&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; on SOAR for SAP for inspiration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the “Review + Create” section click save. Your rule is now live!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1211976304"&gt;Build upon or extend the provided analytic rules&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since the Kusto Query is fully transparent to you (see above screenshot) it is easy to derive your own tailored scenarios from it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For instance, take analytic rule “Deactivation of Audit Trail” and extend the client IP address attribute (client_ip_address__col_7) to project in plain English if that is an internal or external IP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;| extend GeoLocation= iff(ipv4_is_private(client_ip_address__col_7),
dynamic({"IsPrivate": true}),
geo_info_from_ip_address(client_ip_address__col_7))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have a feeling this might be of interest during your incident triage process &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1015462799"&gt;Final Words&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;That’s a wrap&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":burrito:"&gt;🌯&lt;/span&gt;. You saw today how to discover the built-in analytic rules of the SAP LogServ solution in Microsoft Sentinel and how easy it is to extend them for your own individual needs. The rule catalog gets extended continuously based on customer demand.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your existing investments in SAP infrastructure detections in Sentinel can easily be made compatible with the LogServ schema, because SAP simply forwards the logs unaltered as raw messages. The only required step is the unboxing of their JSON root message.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;#Kudos to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1619343"&gt;@Hemanth_Kusampudi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and team for the partnership.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Get started with your deployment from &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-logserv-integration-with-microsoft-sentinel-for-sap-rise-customers-is/bc-p/14089301" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; today&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Which detections or analytic rules for RISE do you need most?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Find your way to our central blog series entry&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-members/ultimate-blog-series-sap-logserv-integration-with-microsoft-sentinel/ba-p/14126401" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;here&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dear community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Due to the asynchronous integration between SAP LogServ and Microsoft Sentinel, it's advisable to perform a smoke test yourself before sharing your config data with SAP. This helps confirm if your receiving connector setup works and ensures the correct configuration will be shared with SAP the first time round.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1605032233"&gt;Run a smoke test for ease of mind&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the SAP LogServ push-connector is deployed on Microsoft Sentinel, you can start posting data towards its data collection endpoint. Use the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://github.com/MartinPankraz/LogServAccelerators" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;provided REST client collection&lt;/A&gt;, or scripts&lt;/SPAN&gt; to replicate the exact requests details that LogServ is performing too.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Maintain the variables as per your environment, see the LogServ sample payload and start posting. A working request shows http code 204 with no content on the response. See a sample output from the provided powershell script for reference. I prefer REST clients but people are different &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_sunglasses:"&gt;😎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="MartinPankraz_0-1751458923696.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/281782i671E08F07FB909B9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MartinPankraz_0-1751458923696.png" alt="MartinPankraz_0-1751458923696.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find the parameters from the SAP LogServ Sentinel &lt;STRONG&gt;connector wizard&lt;/STRONG&gt; on initial connect (see screenshot below). You can also get them directly from the individual resources. The data collection endpoint and data collection rule are created in the same resource group as your Log Analytics workspace underpinning Sentinel. They are prefixed with “SAPLogServ”. The app registration on Entra ID can be found from the Entra Application ID field.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="MartinPankraz_1-1751458923709.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/281781iE03B6FBB91C6BDA4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MartinPankraz_1-1751458923709.png" alt="MartinPankraz_1-1751458923709.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use the 2 KQL queries below to inspect your first data entry on the SAPLogServ_CL table in Sentinel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SAPLogServ_CL
| take 10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SAPLogServ_CL
| summarize count() by clz_dir, clz_subdir
| order by clz_dir asc, clz_subdir asc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="MartinPankraz_2-1751459555337.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/281792i2C09B46070C0EB64/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MartinPankraz_2-1751459555337.png" alt="MartinPankraz_2-1751459555337.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Wait a minute or two on first try. The population of new tables takes a short time initially.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alternatively, deploy the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP LogServ insights workbook&lt;/STRONG&gt; on Sentinel for visual oversight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/293205i51387FEFC9EF3492/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture2.png" alt="Picture2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once saved to your workspace, start looking for the smoke test result.&amp;nbsp;It covers all your observabilty needs going forward.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/293203i1EC52AF633B51536/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture1.png" alt="Picture1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1408518728"&gt;Hurray you have a functioning data collection endpoint for the SAP LogServ data&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":party_popper:"&gt;🎉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, continue your onboarding journey by sharing the config data with SAP over your chosen channel. Find the details on SAP's blog &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-logserv-integration-with-microsoft-sentinel-for-sap-rise-customers-is/bc-p/14089301" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1212005223"&gt;What if you don’t see the data entry on the LogServ table?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Verify the connection details: Did you really hit the right endpoint? Are you looking in the right tenant and log analytics workspace?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Verify selection criteria: Is your Time range filter accurate? The smoke tests create entries for NOW or 30mins earlier in UTC.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Did enough time pass on the initial table population? Consider a retry of the KQL query.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Verify the Data collection rule has not been changed to filter all results or similar. See &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-members/how-to-customize-your-sap-logserv-solution-in-microsoft-sentinel-part-2/ba-p/14110388" target="_blank"&gt;this blog part&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; and KQL snippet for more details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1144574437"&gt;Deployment fully messed up?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The simplest way to a fresh start is a delete and redeployment of the Log Analytics workspace. In case that is not an option you need to delete the LogServ connector resources to reset the LogServ solution in Sentinel. The data collection endpoint, data collection rule and entra id app registration can be deleted from the Azure portal. But the data connector itself needs to be deleted via API.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For your convenience, use this &lt;A href="https://github.com/MartinPankraz/LogServAccelerators/blob/main/SAP-LogServ-bruno-collection.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;REST API request collection&lt;/A&gt; to drop the resources. Once performed the LogServ connector UI will activate the deploy button again. In case you went fully bazooka and also deleted the SAPLogServ_CL table from your Log Analytics worksapce that needs to be reverted too. If the table had data you need to run a restore operation from &lt;A href="https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/table/restore?view=azure-cli-latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Azure CLI&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-818978213"&gt;Final Words&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;That’s a wrap&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":burrito:"&gt;🌯&lt;/span&gt;. You saw today how to streamline your onboarding experience of SAP LogServ in Microsoft Sentinel. Simple smoke tests &lt;STRONG&gt;ensure a speedy onboarding&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;confidence in the shared setup&lt;/STRONG&gt; configuration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;#Kudos to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1619343"&gt;@Hemanth_Kusampudi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and team for the partnership.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Get started with your deployment from &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-logserv-integration-with-microsoft-sentinel-for-sap-rise-customers-is/bc-p/14089301" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; today&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cheers Martin&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the second quarter of 2025, we released several new features and enhancements. Did you know that you can find all new feature announcements for SAP Cloud Identity Services in the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/what-s-new-for-identity-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services Release Notes&lt;/A&gt; on the SAP Help Portal? &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let’s take a look at some of our recent highlights! &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1734236933"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Identity Provisioning Service: Job log improvements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Job Execution Outcome&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;is now displayed on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Job Execution Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;screen and included in the job notifications. It appears when delta-read jobs and jobs that fail to read entities from the source system affect the deletion of entities in the target system.&lt;BR /&gt;For more information, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/monitor-provisioning-job-logs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Monitor Provisioning Job Logs&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can now download and view the details of all &lt;STRONG&gt;deleted entities by a provisioning job&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The APIs for process automation are quite important to building integration scenarios with processes. But many people do not know how to get started, and even experienced users do not know how to work with environments or how to handle authentication or when an API key is needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So here is a guide to the APIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;NOTE:&lt;/STRONG&gt; I assume that you already know how to work with process automation, and you know the ins and outs of creating and triggering process projects using the SAP Build UI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1734296610"&gt;What can you do with APIs&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you just use forms to trigger a process, and then the process runs with actions and approval forms, you may not need to use the APIs. But most sophisticated processes will require you to make use of the APIs. So here is a list of some of things you can do with the APIs:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Trigger a process (sending in input values)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get the status of a process instance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get the context and execution log of a process instance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Change the status of a process instance (such as suspend or cancel)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get a list of existing processes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get a list of open user tasks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Approve or reject an approval form&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Execute any form, and select which button of the form to simulate pressing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Call a decision (business rule) to get the appropriate output&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get a list of automation jobs that were run&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;... and much more&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1537783105"&gt;Where to get information on APIs&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The best place to go to get basic reference information about the APIs is, of course, the &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Accelerator Hub&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_0-1752393322153.png" style="width: 940px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285815i31BE0E141C34DC2B/image-dimensions/940x516?v=v2" width="940" height="516" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_0-1752393322153.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_0-1752393322153.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Search for &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Process Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;, and then under &lt;STRONG&gt;APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt; you will see the package of APIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_1-1752393397195.png" style="width: 980px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285816i7FE8188F9D4A6B3D/image-dimensions/980x538?v=v2" width="980" height="538" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_1-1752393397195.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_1-1752393397195.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt; package, and you will see 1 OData API and 6 REST API. The key APIs are the REST APIs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_2-1752393659529.png" style="width: 984px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285818i796681E9FACB0825/image-dimensions/984x540?v=v2" width="984" height="540" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_2-1752393659529.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_2-1752393659529.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here's a link to get to the &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/package/SAPProcessAutomation/overview" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Build Process Automation package&lt;/A&gt; directly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1341269600"&gt;Authentication and Permissions&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The most complex part of working with the APIs is the authentication, and understanding the types of authentication and what each enables you to do.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1273838814"&gt;2 Main Authentication Methods&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are 2 main ways to perform OAuth2 authentication:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Client Credentials&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where you are signing in as the service, which has essentially admin rights (but not complete access to all information)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User Token&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where you are signing in as a user (you) with whatever rights you have been given, both in terms of process automation roles and permissions in a specific SAP Build environment (more on environments later)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Because you often want to know who the user is who is calling the API. For example, when triggering a process, the user who makes the API call is the one listed in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Monitoring&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab. If that's not important, you can use client credentials with a service key.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Or, if you are retrieving workflow instances from an environment, only a member from that environment with the correct permissions can access the workflow instances. Using client credentials with the client id/secret will not work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1206408028"&gt;Client Credentials&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;To connect, with Client Credentials, you send a Client ID and Client Secret, derived from the service key.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the cockpit, where you created an instance of the SAP Build Process Automation service, you need to create a service key.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_0-1752417693081.png" style="width: 1027px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285867i8F129C07454581AE/image-dimensions/1027x462?v=v2" width="1027" height="462" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_0-1752417693081.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_0-1752417693081.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You only need supply a name for the key.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_1-1752417782846.png" style="width: 536px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285868i0FB20EA19669541A/image-dimensions/536x583?v=v2" width="536" height="583" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_1-1752417782846.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_1-1752417782846.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once you create the key, you can view the key's detail by clicking &lt;STRONG&gt;View&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_2-1752417981277.png" style="width: 632px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285869i05B3E68B5F06D623/image-dimensions/632x225?v=v2" width="632" height="225" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_2-1752417981277.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_2-1752417981277.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This displays something like this:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_4-1752418186519.png" style="width: 533px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285872iC56FF8CD5EE3E383/image-dimensions/533x353?v=v2" width="533" height="353" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_4-1752418186519.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_4-1752418186519.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You only need the following fields to log in:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;api&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The host of the APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;clientid&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Username&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;clientsecret&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Password&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;url&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Authentication URL to get the authorization token (the URL is this URL with &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;/oauth/token&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; appended)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;So if you were setting up a destination, this is how it would work:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_5-1752418574682.png" style="width: 1169px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285873iCCA2D534432A80CE/image-dimensions/1169x304?v=v2" width="1169" height="304" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_5-1752418574682.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_5-1752418574682.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1009894523"&gt;User Token&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;But many times, perhaps most times, you do not want to use a service user but you want to know who is making the call. This is important, for example, if the call is to approve the task, so only the user to whom the task is assigned should be updating the task. Or, as we mentioned above, only a real member of an environment can retrieve workflow instances from a shared environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With a destination, the only change you need to make is to change the &lt;STRONG&gt;Authentication&lt;/STRONG&gt; field to &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth2JWTBearer&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and this will make sure to retrieve and send a token for the current user. All other destination fields are the same.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_6-1752419014072.png" style="width: 958px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285878iA9507D6922882032/image-dimensions/958x353?v=v2" width="958" height="353" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_6-1752419014072.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_6-1752419014072.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-684298299"&gt;Environments&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the relatively new shared environments (i.e., all environments except &lt;STRONG&gt;Public&lt;/STRONG&gt;), you sometimes need to indicate in the API call to which environment you are making the call to. For example, a process may be deployed to multiple environments, so when you call to trigger it, you need to specify in which environment to trigger it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To do this, you add this query parameter:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;?environmentId=MyEnvironment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similarly, if you want to retrieve all the process instances from a particular environment, your API URL might look like this:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://spa-api-gateway-bpi-us-prod.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/workflow/rest/v1/workflow-instances?environmentId=danielshared&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-358702075"&gt;Try Out on Accelerator Hub&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's try to access our SAP Build Process Automation process instances from the SAP Business Accelerator Hub.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go to the GET &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/SPA_Workflow_Runtime/tryout" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;workflow-instances API&lt;/A&gt;. On the left menu, click &lt;STRONG&gt;Workflow Instances&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and then select the first API call.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_7-1752421445996.png" style="width: 1000px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285879i36710A5BC2EF2E34/image-dimensions/1000x549?v=v2" width="1000" height="549" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_7-1752421445996.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_7-1752421445996.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click &lt;STRONG&gt;Add New Environment&lt;/STRONG&gt; on the right, and fill in the details using the values from your service key.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Call the environment &lt;STRONG&gt;My Trial&amp;nbsp;BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, select the authentication domain for your tenant (for my trial account it was &lt;A href="http://authentication.us10.hana.ondemand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://authentication.us10.hana.ondemand.com/&lt;/A&gt;) and then when entering the consumer subdomain, only enter the subdomain for your subaccount.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the bottom indicate you want to save the environment for the future, and click &lt;STRONG&gt;Configure&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp;It might take a minute for the configuration to save.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_9-1752422350647.png" style="width: 1108px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285881iE4CEC3AAE3AAB9D6/image-dimensions/1108x1105?v=v2" width="1108" height="1105" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_9-1752422350647.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_9-1752422350647.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then, on the right, select the environment, and click &lt;STRONG&gt;Run&lt;/STRONG&gt;. You should get your workflow instances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Dan_Wroblewski_10-1752422443389.png" style="width: 1032px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285882iA06CA12E3F04F7CD/image-dimensions/1032x717?v=v2" width="1032" height="717" role="button" title="Dan_Wroblewski_10-1752422443389.png" alt="Dan_Wroblewski_10-1752422443389.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

This marks a clear step into the era of Agentic AI – systems that can understand context, take initiative, and drive outcomes autonomously. “SAP combines the world’s most powerful suite of business applications with uniquely rich data and the latest AI innovations to create a flywheel of customer value,” &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2025/05/sap-business-ai-reimagine-how-enterprises-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;said CEO Christian Klein&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. While this evolution opens exciting possibilities for automation and productivity, it also introduces a new layer of complexity in how we approach security. Agentic systems challenge traditional safeguards, making it essential to identify and mitigate risks early through tailored threat modeling.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At its core, threat modeling is about asking the right questions early in the development process, while the system is still being designed and built. Rather than simply looking for bugs or code flaws, it forces us to think through how a system might behave in the real world. What could go wrong if an agent’s goals are manipulated? Could someone poison its memory over time? What if an agent uses a tool in an unintended or unsafe way? How could agent-generated content be used to mislead or overload human decision-makers? What happens when agents collaborate or collide in ways that expose the system to cascading failures or manipulation?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These are not hypothetical questions. They reflect the real and emerging risks of agentic systems. The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;OWASP Agentic AI Threats &amp;amp; Mitigations Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; is a valuable resource that brings structure to this thinking. It highlights specific threats such as memory poisoning, cascading hallucinations, privilege compromise, and agent communication poisoning. For teams building these systems, it helps provide a common vocabulary and practical examples to guide threat modeling work.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To give an example of how threat modeling helps in practice, let’s take the case of goal manipulation – one of the emerging risks identified in the OWASP guide. In agentic systems, attackers don’t necessarily need to exploit traditional software flaws. Instead, they can attempt to influence an agent’s behavior over time by subtly manipulating its objectives. This might happen through indirect prompt injection, compromised data sources, or crafted tool responses. Imagine an agent responsible for prioritizing financial transactions; if adversarial inputs gradually shift its decision logic, it could start approving risky payments outside of the intended policy. In threat modeling exercises, we explore how such scenarios could play out by analyzing how the agent forms and updates its goals, how memory and feedback loops could reinforce undesired behaviors, and how downstream actions might be impacted. This helps define targeted mitigations, such as isolating goal-setting logic from external inputs, monitoring shifts in agent behavior, and adding human validation for sensitive decisions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The OWASP Agentic AI Threats &amp;amp; Mitigations Guide provides a helpful reference architecture that illustrates where these types of risks can emerge. The diagram below maps threats to key components in a typical agentic system, making it easier to visualize how threat modeling applies in practice.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="helenoakley_0-1752751657687.png" style="width: 844px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287897iD3D301C81278E582/image-dimensions/844x449?v=v2" width="844" height="449" role="button" title="helenoakley_0-1752751657687.png" alt="helenoakley_0-1752751657687.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Image Source: OWASP Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations guide, “Threat Model Summary”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At SAP, threat modeling has long been part of our &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/03/a248a699-627c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Secure Software Development and Operations Lifecycle (Secure SDOL)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, which is certified under ISO 27001. This framework ensures security is built into every phase of the product lifecycle, from design to operations. With Agentic AI, we are expanding our threat modeling approach to address risks that don’t typically appear in traditional application security. This includes analyzing agent memory behavior, reasoning patterns, system autonomy, human interaction points, and the dynamics of multi-agent ecosystems. The focus shifts from identifying static vulnerabilities to understanding how autonomy and learning can lead to unintended behaviors. From there, we define appropriate controls and mitigations to reduce those risks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The field of Agentic AI security continues to take shape. Standards like ISO 42001 and regulations such as the EU AI Act are in development, and industry best practices are actively maturing. That’s why collaboration is essential. SAP is contributing to the conversations held with industry groups focused on these challenges, including &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://genai.owasp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;OWASP GenAI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; initiatives. We’re not just adopting ideas, we’re helping shape them, working with peers and regulators to advance the state of AI security. Our teams bring deep expertise in both enterprise security and AI systems, offering a perspective that’s helping guide how the broader ecosystem approaches agentic risks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Transparency remains central to how SAP approaches product security. As we continue evolving our work with AI, we’re committed to sharing what we learn through resources like the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Trust Center&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. Security is not a one-time effort. It is a continuous process, especially with systems as dynamic as Agentic AI.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Threat modeling helps us stay ahead of these evolving risks and supports the design of systems that are both capable and safe. As Agentic AI becomes more embedded in enterprise workflows, this kind of proactive thinking becomes essential.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP is proud to contribute to shaping the future of secure AI. By collaborating across the industry and applying deep expertise from our teams, we’re helping advance practical, forward-looking approaches to securing the next generation of intelligent systems.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H3 id="ember54" id="toc-hId-1864238372"&gt;General Overview&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The Business Partner (BP) transaction is the central tool for managing customer and vendor master data in SAP S/4HANA. For many customers, this represents a transition from older transactions like XK01, FK01, and FD01. This change is part of the core data model redesign in S/4HANA, aimed at consolidating customer and vendor information into a single, unified repository. By doing so, it eliminates data redundancy and streamlines business processes. This approach is often also referred to as Customer-Vendor Integration (CVI).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;This shift has many &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Security consultants scratching their heads&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The consolidated&lt;STRONG&gt; transaction&lt;/STRONG&gt; called &lt;STRONG&gt;BP &lt;/STRONG&gt;in S/4HANA combines functionality from &lt;STRONG&gt;over 60 legacy transactions&lt;/STRONG&gt; into one powerful master transaction. While efficient, This simplification introduces a lot of complexity — particularly for security.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;When you check the SU24 data for the BP transaction, you'll find it can include anywhere from 20 to 80 authorization objects. While this extensive list provides fine-grained control over access—which is great from a security standpoint—it can also be overwhelming. Assigning the BP transaction to a PFCG role often means suddenly facing the task of maintaining values for 30 or more authorization objects, which few enjoy dealing with.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="1752683221212.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288591iE3E2CC333450130C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="1752683221212.png" alt="1752683221212.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Another challenge with the BP transaction is that, despite having a large number of authorization objects available to control access, many of these checks are inactive by default. As a result, the transaction appears to offer granular control, but in reality, it lacks many essential authorization checks—making it difficult to enforce precise access restrictions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;If your organization has a central team managing master data, you may not encounter some of the challenges mentioned earlier. However, in scenarios involving geographically distributed teams and decentralized master data management, maintaining effective authorizations for the BP transaction can become a significant issue.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Now that we’ve identified the challenges, let’s explore how to tackle them. In this blog, I’ll clarify and break down the key authorization objects you can use to manage BP authorizations more effectively.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1667724867"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;What all transactions BP replaced&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Lets start with the basics, the following transaction codes are no longer available as standalone transactions in the S/4HANA system. You can verify the updated list by checking the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;PRGN_CORR2&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;table using transaction&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SE16&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;in your system.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;FD01, FD02, FD03, FD05, FD06, FD08&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;FK01, FK02, FK03, FK05, FK06, FK08&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;MAP1, MAP2, MAP3&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;MK01, MK02, MK03, MK05, MK06, MK12, MK18, MK19&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;V-03, V-04, V-05, V-06, V-07, V-08, V-09, V-11, V+21, V+22, V+23&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;VAP1, VAP2, VAP3&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;VD01, VD02, VD03, VD05, VD06&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;XD01, XD02, XD03, XD05, XD06, XD07&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;XK01, XK02, XK03, XK05, XK06, XK07&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;It’s important to note that while you may still assign these transactions to users, executing them in S/4HANA typically redirects the user to the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;BP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;transaction, often accompanied by an informational message at the bottom of the screen "Redirecting to transaction BP"&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="1752683791327.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288592iDF0DBFB75D79B174/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="1752683791327.png" alt="1752683791327.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1471211362"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Managing the Authorizations for Business Partner transaction&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Just like restricting any other transaction in SAP, restricting BP transactions comes down to the correct restrictions across various authorization objects. We will go through these one by one. Lets start then,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;When you Execute the BP transaction you are shown this initial screen(see figure) where you can search for a Business Partner(Customer, Vendor etc) using various criterias.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;As expected an initial S_TCODE - checks for start transaction code access happens here. Nothing complicated so far,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="1752694802679.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288593i0BFCD1B29CC319E6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="1752694802679.png" alt="1752694802679.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once you select a Business Partner the details of the business partner id displayed(see figure), and a lot of authorization checks happens at this level, this is where things gets complicated as well. Lets look at these one by one :&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;B_BUPA_RLT Business Partner: BP Roles&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;This Authorization object controls what BP role a uses has, these BP Role (don't confuse these with PFCG roles) defines what functions a user can perform (ACTVT) and also controls the assignment blocks visible in the BP screen(RLTYP). For example:- If the user selects "Business Partner(Gen.)" Role from the dropdown, it allows editing of basic(general) data of the BP. But if the users switches to a different role "Customer" then some additional tabs will open up where data relevant to cutomers can be maintained.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="1752686065246.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288594i4BCE9BD70B0065C6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="1752686065246.png" alt="1752686065246.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Although, SAP Delivers some standard BP roles these can still be configured and created in SPRO img configuration by your functional team if need arises.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SPRO → Cross-Application Components → SAP Business Partner → Business Partner → Basic Settings → Business Partner Roles →Define BP Roles&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Read more about this here -&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fme%2Esap%2Ecom%2Fnotes%2F3416144&amp;amp;urlhash=aomx&amp;amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://me.sap.com/notes/3416144&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="1752685363552.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288595iBD1CEA2B870C62C7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="1752685363552.png" alt="1752685363552.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Next is,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;B_BUPA_GRP Business Partner: Authorization Groups&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;With this authorization object, you define which business partners can be edited on the basis of the authorization groups.

    <content>&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1994064908"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services (CIS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a robust suite of tools designed to manage identity and access across the SAP ecosystem. This blog explores how CIS integrates with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SuccessFactors&lt;/STRONG&gt;, focusing on hybrid integration patterns that enable seamless user authentication and identity provisioning in complex enterprise landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;There are &lt;STRONG&gt;three primary flavors&lt;/STRONG&gt; to integrating&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Standard Integration (Recommended)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Proxy Integration using CIS(external IDP as authentication provider)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Hybrid Integration using CIS (external IDP or both external IDP and CIS as authentication provider) without SF being the source of user records to CIS&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP SuccessFactors with SAP Cloud Identity Services:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1797551403"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Option 1: Integration Between SAP SuccessFactors and SAP CIS (Standard)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide1.PNG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290518i7D24CB293B1CDDD1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide1.PNG" alt="Slide1.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the most recommended method, fully aligned with SAP’s best practices for managing user identities. It involves the following steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integrate&amp;nbsp;SAP SuccessFactors&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;Identity Authentication: Run the upgrade job in the SAP SuccessFactors Upgrade Center to enable features and establish trust between SF and CIS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Confirm that user sync is set up in&amp;nbsp;Identity Provisioning&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;SAP Cloud Identity Services:&amp;nbsp;Set up sync jobs with&amp;nbsp;Identity Provisioning. Ensure that the user that is configured in the&amp;nbsp;Identity Provisioning&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review the default configurations:&amp;nbsp;Review the default configuration of the&amp;nbsp;Identity Authentication&amp;nbsp;service to determine if it meets your requirements or if additional configuration is required.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additional configuration optional features:Configuration options in&amp;nbsp;Identity Authentication&amp;nbsp;include:&amp;nbsp; Password policy settings, Single sign-on (SSO) etc&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Activate Identity Authentication (IAS): Turn on the&amp;nbsp;Identity Authentication&amp;nbsp;service&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This ensures standardized, low-effort configuration and a consistent integration experience.

Federation can be used if user records exist. Synching user records in CIS unlock features like SAC and future innovations such as SAP Joule, as they're a key prerequisite for access. Ideal for customers wanting minimal disruption to existing identity infrastructure while gaining access to SAP’s innovation roadmap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1404524393"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Option 3: Hybrid Integration — Using SAP CIS as a Proxy Without Standard SF User Sync. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further details in this blog primarily focuses on this &lt;STRONG&gt;hybrid model&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide6.PNG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290527i29BD04C542670248/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide6.PNG" alt="Slide6.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Characteristics:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP SuccessFactors is not the user provisioning source.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CIS can act as a &lt;STRONG&gt;proxy&lt;/STRONG&gt; or both proxy and IDP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;User profile data is synced to CIS from a different /external source to enable:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Access to services like &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Federated authentication via external IdPs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This method provides the flexibility to maintain external Identity manager to keep managing users in an enterprise while using SAP CIS to enabling access to SAP applications and to access new features and innovations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1208010888"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":gear:"&gt;⚙️&lt;/span&gt;Understanding Standard Integration Behavior&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP’s standard SF-to-CIS integration includes &lt;STRONG&gt;two background jobs(in case if SAC exist)&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Job 1: User Sync from SuccessFactors to IAS&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reads user data from SF.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creates users in CIS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Generates a &lt;STRONG&gt;Global User ID&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and store it in personKeyNav/GlobalUserId in SF.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Populates CustomAttribute1 if the user has SAC access permissions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Job 2: Sync to SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reads user data from SF and syncs only users with access to &lt;STRONG&gt;embedded analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt; to SAC&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Prevents SAC user creation for ineligible accounts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1011497383"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":gear:"&gt;⚙️&lt;/span&gt;Adapting the Integration for an External Data Source&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you're not syncing users from SAP SF (i.e., using an external Data source like Identity manager), the standard jobs need to be customized to use IAS as the source and SAC as the target. It is very important to make sure that only users who have permission to embedded analytics should be synched to SAC. This step can be done either inside the cync job or can be taken care at source level (making sure to populate the custom attribute only if user has permission to access SAC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":warning:"&gt;⚠️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;EM&gt;To configure this job, you can modify the existing target or create a new one.

SAP CIS supports multiple Subject Name Identifiers (SNI) per application, allowing flexibility. For scenarios where CIS login name is taken by another application as the identifier and it doesn't have the same value as username in SF then any other field supported field can be used for SNI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SuccessFactors (SF)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, it's essential to ensure that the runtime value of the SNI must align with the &lt;STRONG&gt;SF username field&lt;/STRONG&gt; to enable proper user identification.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Expression-based SNI mapping is supported, but functionality is currently limited. Use with caution and review configuration thoroughly before implementation&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide5.PNG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290528iBDB71765879457B7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide5.PNG" alt="Slide5.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2: Can SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) Work Without a Direct Sync from SF to CIS?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, Though it is recommended to sync it from SF&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAC does not require a direct user synchronization from SF&lt;/STRONG&gt;. However, there's a critical requirement to enable user access:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ensure &lt;STRONG&gt;CustomAttribute1&lt;/STRONG&gt; is correctly populated, as it is used to determine analytics access. Regardless of the data source, this attribute must be synced to SAC via CIS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3: Can CustomAttribute1 Be Replaced with Another Attribute?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Absolutely. &lt;STRONG&gt;CustomAttribute1&lt;/STRONG&gt; is just a label. In SAP CIS, custom attributes are internally stored as an array, offering flexibility in how they're used.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you choose to use a different custom attribute:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ensure the &lt;STRONG&gt;transformation logic&lt;/STRONG&gt; is updated accordingly, to confirm that &lt;STRONG&gt;consuming applications (e.g., SAC)&lt;/STRONG&gt; are configured to read the new attribute.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Update the &lt;STRONG&gt;SNI mapping&lt;/STRONG&gt; to reference the correct custom attribute.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide3.PNG" style="width: 849px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290529i5DA6B47FA95724E5/image-dimensions/849x478?v=v2" width="849" height="478" role="button" title="Slide3.PNG" alt="Slide3.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide4.PNG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290531iED44A7401AC12C91/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide4.PNG" alt="Slide4.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4: Connecting Multiple SF Tenants to a Single CIS Tenant (with SAC for Each SF)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While technically possible, connecting &lt;STRONG&gt;multiple SuccessFactors tenants&lt;/STRONG&gt; to the &lt;STRONG&gt;same CIS tenant,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;each with its own SAC instance, but it is &lt;STRONG&gt;not recommended&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp;This setup introduces significant complexity in&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Managing user states across tenants.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Integrating SAP SuccessFactors with SAP Cloud Identity Services offers flexibility, security, and alignment with SAP’s innovation roadmap. Whether through standard integration or a hybrid identity landscape using external IdPs, these methods empower organizations to centralize access control, reduce redundancy, and prepare for emerging technologies like SAP Joule.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Protect Your SAP S/4HANA from Critical Code Injection Vulnerability [CVE-2025-42957] with SAP Enterprise Threat Detection and SAP Enterprise Threat Detection, cloud edition.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;A critical ABAP code injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-42957) has been discovered in SAP S/4HANA (Private Cloud or On-Premise), exposing SAP systems to potential exploits. This vulnerability allows attackers with user privileges to inject arbitrary ABAP code, bypassing essential authorization checks and putting the entire system at risk of compromise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Details:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Vulnerability ID:&lt;/STRONG&gt; CVE-2025-42957&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CVSS v3.0 Base Score:&lt;/STRONG&gt; 9.9 / 10&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Impacted Components:&lt;/STRONG&gt; S4CORE 102 - 108&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Understanding the Threat:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;This flaw operates as a backdoor, allowing unauthorized access to SAP systems and jeopardizing confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Without immediate mitigation, your SAP S/4HANA system could be severely compromised.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitoring with SAP Enterprise Threat Detection (SAP ETD):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Enterprise Threat Detection&lt;/STRONG&gt; plays a crucial role in identifying and mitigating such vulnerabilities. By adding the function module /SLOAE/DEPLOY to the value list ABAP Blocklisted Function Modules, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Enterprise Threat Detection&lt;/STRONG&gt; can monitor and flag potential exploitation of this vulnerability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Additionally, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Enterprise Threat Detection&lt;/STRONG&gt; can be configured to track the frequency and context of calls to this critical function module. In a recent review of a production system landscape containing 34bn log events it was observed that this function module was not called at all over the last several months, validating its inclusion in threat detection parameters avoiding fals positives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Steps to Secure Your SAP System:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Patch Installation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Apply the correction instructions or support packages referenced by SAP Note &lt;A class="" href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3627998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3627998&lt;/A&gt; to eliminate code injection risks today!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Enterprise Threat Detection Monitoring:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Add /SLOAE/DEPLOY to ABAP Blocklisted Function Modules in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Enterprise Threat Detection&lt;/STRONG&gt; to monitor attempts to exploit this vulnerability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System Audits:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Regularly audit your system for unauthorized access, privileged access, fraudulat behaviour and other signs of exploitation with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Enterprise Threat Detection&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;For further information and the latest updates, refer to the SAP Security Note &lt;A class="" href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3627998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3627998&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP Enterprise Threat Detection information:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/financial-management/enterprise-threat-detection.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;sap.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Arndt&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Stay vigilant and ensure your SAP systems are protected from evolving threats.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;High traffic means more transactions—and more risk. A common misconfiguration during integrations is sending &lt;STRONG&gt;PII data in the URL of a POST request&lt;/STRONG&gt; instead of in the request body.

With IAM, organizations can establish, tailor, and monitor business roles to business needs and requirements. There are several relevant applications available for managing IAM in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP EarlyWatch Alert provides an overview of relevant information and resources to enable the effective use of IAM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1435480387"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1238966882"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deprecated Business Catalogs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is important to adapt existing Business Catalogs and Business Roles resulting from the addition of new scope items or a release upgrade. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, Business Catalogs are periodically revised. Some Business Catalogs will be deprecated and replaced by new ones. The&amp;nbsp;deprecated Business Catalogs in the system may be removed by SAP at the time of a release after it has been declared as deprecated, so it is important to review the deprecated Business Catalogs after each release along with new scope items and make the necessary changes as soon as possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this chapter, a list of deprecated business catalogs in use in the system and information how to handle this is provided.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1042453377"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Users Assigned to Many Business Roles&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP best practice is to assign only one business role to a business user. Each business role must represent a workplace and business roles should be created from scratch using the workplace approach.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For production, it is strongly recommended to build production roles manually to ensure compliance with external and internal compliance rules for access.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the this chapter, the system is checked for users that have multiple business roles assigned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-845939872"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Assignment of users to Business Role SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The role SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR is predefined by SAP and is intended only for the initial configuration of a system.&amp;nbsp;Usage of this role in production does not correspond to SAP recommendations and may lead to compliance issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system is checked for the usage of this role in this chapter to alert on the potential risk that comes along with using it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-649426367"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use of Read/Write Unrestricted&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using unrestricted fields in the maintenance of business roles allow users to have global data access, SAP best practices recommend to carefully review which users need to have restricted data access and maintain the access appropriately, e.g. ensuring employees only have access to data belonging to their sales organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This chapter informs about the number of busines roles with unrestricted write, read or value help access.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Use of Read/Write Unrestricted Result Table Example" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320467i27356E2C63440B60/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jana_pfeffer_1-1758886279904.png" alt="Use of Read/Write Unrestricted Result Table Example" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Use of Read/Write Unrestricted Result Table Example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-452912862"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Catalog Assignments&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business catalogs contain a bundle of privileges needed for accessing an app or features that are then assigned to users via business roles. This section checks for selected critical business catalogs and their assignment to business roles and users and rates this according to the valuationrules from &lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://me.sap.com/notes/863362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;863362&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;In case any critical business catalogs are assigned, additional details are presented as sub-chapters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Business Catalog Assignments Overview Table Example" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/320462i742507EE2D6597F7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jana_pfeffer_0-1758885937645.png" alt="Business Catalog Assignments Overview Table Example" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Business Catalog Assignments Overview Table Example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-256399357"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-59885852"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Communication (Inbound/Outbound)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is recommended that certificate-based communication is used for technical users involved in inbound/outbound communication when possible. Usually, it is easier to detect if a certificate is compromised than detect if a password has been compromised. This chapter identifies whether any customer managed communication arrangements do not use certificate-based authenticate and provides a list of them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--136627653"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Upcoming Certificate Expiration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In case there are any certificates where their expiration date is coming up in the next 90 days, they will be listed in this chapter to notify about this early on.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Do you want to &lt;EM&gt;learn more on how to find and use the security relevant content &lt;/EM&gt;in the SAP EarlyWatch Alert Workspace?
