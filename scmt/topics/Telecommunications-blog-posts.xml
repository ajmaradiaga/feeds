&lt;BR /&gt;
Why do people buy cars? To get around. There may be other reasons, but in the end, what people want is mobility.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Car ownership, however, comes with associated trappings. You’ll need a license and insurance. You may also need financing. And don’t forget, if you want to protect your investment, you’re on the hook for maintenance and repairs.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Or so it is with an ownership-based business model where a manufacturer makes a product (the car) and you (the customer) take it away. The rest is up to you.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1036852056"&gt;Give them mobility&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Today, however, there’s another model – one that is driven by data and technology. Call it the outcome-based model. If what customers want is mobility, then give them mobility as a service.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This is the model followed by Care by Volvo, a mobility subscription service. In the era of the “experience economy,” Volvo recognizes that at least a certain segment of its customers care less about the product and more about the overall experience of mobility. These customers don’t want to sweat the details and responsibilities of owning a car. Instead, they pay a steady monthly price in exchange for a car – upgradable every 12 months – that also includes insurance and road-side assistance.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-840338551"&gt;Blurring lines&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Care by Volvo is only one example of one company in one industry moving to outcome-based models. The fact is, organizations everywhere seek to deliver better customer experiences by crossing traditional industry lines. In the case of Care by Volvo, one line crossed is the line between auto manufacturing and insurance. Now Volvo is generating value by partnering with insurance companies to make life easier for its customers. The insight here is that customers want experiences rather than products. Companies that deliver these experiences are winning the experience economy.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
What does it take for a company to cross industry lines? Increasingly, it takes modern technology, flexible data management, and highly agile processes. By orchestrating these, companies are running on new business models that connect an ecosystem of partners together in an end-to-end value chain that makes life easier for customers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Adjacent capabilities are ripe for the picking – but companies should take a broad view on what may or may not be adjacent. For Care by Volvo, offering insurance seems obvious enough, but what about other possibilities? A few years back, Volvo &lt;A href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10708854/volvo-ericsson-concept-26-autonomous-video-streaming-ces-2016" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;announced its plans&lt;/A&gt; for a driverless car – one that envisioned a partnership with Netflix (so that you can watch videos while the car drives itself) and Ericsson (so that you’ll have a reliable signal for streaming). The flexibility to quickly collaborate with new partners helps accelerate innovation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-643825046"&gt;Enabling disruption&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Stories of companies like Airbnb, Uber, and Netflix disrupting industries with transformative business models are by now a decade old. In their place are countless stories of established companies catching on and learning how to drive market change on their own terms (as evidenced by Volvo).&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
What it takes to move forward is, first and foremost, an understanding of how customer expectations have changed. If the experience now takes precedence over the product, then companies have clear remit to make life easier for their customers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Yet, while the primacy of the customer experience underpins how companies should pursue transformation, the practical considerations on how to make it all happen remains. This is where data, technology, and processes come into play.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-447311541"&gt;SAP and the customer experience&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
At SAP we understand the need for data visibility, intelligent technologies, and agile processes. In fact, we’ve built them all into our next-generation ERP offering, SAP S/4HANA.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;: With a simplified data model that streamlines data access and management, SAP S/4HANA enables you to seize new opportunities faster. Now you have the agility required to string together new or existing business processes and plug into larger value chains. Subscription-based services, predictive maintenance, integrated financing – whatever the business model, SAP S/4HANA supports a single source of truth that gives you the visibility to understand your customers and serve them better.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Intelligent technologies&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Internet of Things (IoT) technology can be used to capture important usage data from cars, industrial machines, coffee makers, and much more. Machine learning can then be used to compare this data against historical data in real time to identify patterns that yield insight about customer behavior. Blockchain technology can be used for virtually irrefutable transaction transparency while 3D printing can help speed manufacturing and move production closer to the end customer. SAP S/4HANA is designed to work flexibly with all of these technologies and more.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agile processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;: SAP S/4HANA supports standardized processes in 25 industries. Plugging into these processes can help you break through industry boundaries and collaborate with diverse partners to deliver the value customers seek. More recently, SAP has added customer experience data to the mix with the acquisition of Qualtrics. Today, SAP can combine now combine immensely rich stores of operational data with real-time metrics on the customer experience to help you serve your customers better.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-250798036"&gt;And some help from SAP Transformation Navigator&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
If you’re implementing SAP S/4HANA, of even if you’re running it, SAP Transformation Navigator is a good place to start for blurring industry boundaries. This tool starts with your as-is environment and allows you to map out your transformation as you see fit.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Let’s say you’re a pharmacy, traditionally seen as a subset of retail. Now let’s say, you want to move toward markets in the insurance and healthcare industries. For whatever business you want to go after, you can use SAP Transformation Navigator to explore healthcare and insurance capabilities, and then import them to your retail road map.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Industry templates, meanwhile, provide a good opportunity to dive into exactly the kinds of processes your cross-industry competitors already run.&amp;nbsp; SAP Transformation Navigator also supports higher-level value maps that instantly resonate with industry audiences with a “showcase view” that highlights the most relevant and recommended capabilities. For this reason, they help engage stakeholders, facilitate buy-in, and drive transformation forward.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With SAP S/4HANA, and SAP Transformation Navigator to help guide the way, SAP customers everywhere are moving forward with digital transformation projects designed to seize new markets and blur industry boundaries.

    <title>3 Ways Unified Communications Can Improve Your Customer Service</title>

    <content>&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Contacting customer services often feels like a real chore. It’s something that we - in our roles as consumers – tend to avoid doing whenever possible. As a business owner, that’s not how you want your customers to feel about your company. You need to find a different way to approach customer service.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;What if the service you offered could win customers over from your rivals? More than that, what if it could lead your customers to recommend you to friends and relatives? The fact is that customer service truly is that &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2019/07/04/the-importance-of-great-customer-service-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;important to consumers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/02/image2-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;(&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/why-customer-service-is-so-important-to-online-shoppers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.zendesk.com/blog/why-customer-service-is-so-important-to-online-shoppers/" target="test_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.zendesk.com/blog/why-customer-service-is-so-important-to-online-shoppers/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;How, then, can you make your customer service a differentiator? How can you deliver a customer experience that sets you apart? The answer could be via &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.ringcentral.co.uk/office/unified-communications.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;unified communications&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;. Put all communications under one unified umbrella, and you can offer customers a better end-to-end service.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;There are many ways in which unified communications can boost customer service. We’re going to deal with three of the most significant below. First, though, let’s talk about precisely what the phrase ‘unified communications’ means.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-931779744"&gt;&lt;B&gt;What Does Unified Communications Mean?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Unified communications (UC) is one of those phrases that’s simpler than it first appears. UC is a new way to approach modern business communications. With a UC platform, a firm can bring together – or unify – all their different channels. You can blend all the ways you use to speak to customers, clients, and team members.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;With UC, you don't juggle email accounts, phone lines, IM services, and other channels. Instead, everything gets brought together. A UC solution helps businesses manage all their channels more effectively. It also allows for enhanced integration of those channels. That means a broader scope for collaboration both within and beyond the organization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;The overriding purpose of UC is to enhance human-to-human contact. A unified platform makes it easier for a company to communicate effectively. Unified communications, as a result, can have a profound impact on customer service.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-735266239"&gt;&lt;B&gt;Three Ways Unified Communications Can Help Your Customer Service&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2016/03/01/effective-communication-is-key-to-modern-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Effective communication&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt; is vital to customer service. Whoever your customers are, being able to interact with them efficiently is essential. UC platforms open a host of new avenues for your customer service provision. The following are three ways that UC can help you to deliver better customer service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-667835453"&gt;&lt;B&gt;Provide Better Information, More Quickly&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;When a customer contacts you, they’re looking for a swift reaction. They want their questions answered or issues solved as quickly as possible. Unified communications better places you to provide precisely that kind of service. With a UC platform, you can offer better information, in far less time.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/02/image3-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;(&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://customerthink.com/how-to-improve-your-customer-service-response-times/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;A href="http://customerthink.com/how-to-improve-your-customer-service-response-times/" target="test_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;http://customerthink.com/how-to-improve-your-customer-service-response-times/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;With a UC system, an agent can swiftly find an answer to any customer query. That might be by accessing order information. It could be by contacting an expert within or outside the organization. Either way, you can do it all in the same system, thanks to UC. No longer do customers have to suffer long hold times or wait for you to call them back.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;That kind of efficient cross-organizational communication, too, helps you to provide better information. Your agents can share in-depth details via email or other channels while talking on the phone. They could even hand off a customer to a specialist with ease.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-471321948"&gt;&lt;B&gt;Be Available to All Customers at All Times&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;If you run an international firm or operate 24/7, you need to communicate via many channels. Customers abroad may not be able to reach you on the phone. Someone buying online in the early hours of the morning may need an answer before your office opens. UC solutions help you to communicate better with these customers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;The unified platform draws together communications from all channels. That makes it swift and straightforward to respond to out of hours queries. You might even be able to handle them with &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/04/04/chatbots-redefining-customer-service-for-growing-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;chatbots&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;. It also means you can transfer specific questions to locations in different time zones if you have them.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;What’s more, UC lets you deliver consistent service across channels and devices. Your staff will have quick access to all prior contact with a customer. Take, for example, if someone exchanges emails with your firm and then later calls you up. Your agent who answers the call can bring up the past email thread with ease via a UC platform.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-274808443"&gt;&lt;B&gt;Enhance Interactions &amp;amp; Strengthen Relationships&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;UC platforms give you a broader range of ways in which to communicate with customers. You don’t have to only rely on phone conversations or email threads. You can introduce enhanced interactions to take your customer service to a new level.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Collaboration tools like screen-sharing or video conferencing are vital in this regard. They allow your staff to walk customers through solutions to their problems. Your agents can genuinely show them what they need to do to get products or services back on track. All those options are that their fingertips within the same system.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/02/image1-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;(&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies" target="test_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.shopify.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;The impact of such personal and effective service is profound. It creates far stronger customer relationships. Your customers will view you as an organization that cares. They’ll know that you give as much attention to aftercare as you do to sales. That will make them far more likely to become loyal, repeat customers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--50787781"&gt;&lt;B&gt;Customer Service Benefits from a Unified Approach to Communication&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Superior customer service is about always doing your best for your customers. You need to deliver the same positive experience every time they reach out to you. That means offering accurate information quickly. It also means being able to do so wherever the customer is, and however they contact you.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

    <content>&lt;STRONG&gt;Note to SAP Community members:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP recognizes the importance of the integrity of the SAP Community. In an effort to continue to support the community and at the same time adapt to this &lt;A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/03/31/tackling-what-lies-ahead-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;time of uncertainty&lt;/A&gt;, we are creating a &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/resources/c19freeaccess" target="_blank"&gt;temporary space&lt;/A&gt; for partners who have free solutions that can help you continue to move forward. Our intention is to give you &lt;A href="https://blogs.sap.com/tag/c19freeaccess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;direct access&lt;/A&gt; to their solutions as they may provide you with practical help to tackle COVID-19 disruptions.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The spread of COVID-19 has affected almost all spheres of human life – physical, emotional, and economic. Businesses are grappling with this unforeseen situation and trying to mitigate several challenges. As this global crisis signals business and cash flow difficulties for the next few months, we joined hands with &lt;A href="https://ktern.com/?utm_source=content&amp;amp;utm_medium=sapcommunity&amp;amp;utm_campaign=c19freeaccess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;KTern&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; to do what little we can for the&amp;nbsp;SAP&amp;nbsp;fraternity we know and love.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the spirit of goodwill, we will be delivering a KTern product-automated &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Qualified DTAR (Digital Transformation Assessment Report)&lt;/STRONG&gt; to help businesses with their SAP productivity now and beyond COVID-19. The report is cost-free with no strings attached as we stand together during this crisis to ensure your productivity at first and happiness at best.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Within 2 business days of Auto-Assessment (remotely), KTern will auto-generate the SAP Certified DTAR to help organizations map their “as-is” SAP system, identify areas to optimize, and present a roadmap for the effective realization of the possible optimizations.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <title>What to Know When Choosing an Internet Service Provider</title>
    <updated>2020-05-18T07:30:13+02:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>It’s clear that our lives revolve around internet access, regardless of the usage is for professional or personal purposes, the fact is that the internet is an important tool we have come to depend on. We all want a fast and reliable internet connection that is dependable enough to help us get through the day. We all want an internet connection that never goes down and is accessible on a 24/7 basis.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The internet allows us to connect globally, uniting everyone and allowing us to make the impossible possible. Therefore, before you decide to select a service provider it’s always wise to do research, but the thing about research is no one wants to do it and everyone wants to benefit from it.&amp;nbsp; So I have taken the liberty and highlighted some of the areas that you want to focus on before you have the installation technician come over.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-933568222"&gt;DATA LIMITS AND METERED CONNECTIONS&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The first thing that you want to look out for are data caps, I mean they are just lame and annoying. If you happen to be a Windows 10 user then you should know that there is no option to turn off automatic updates, which means your personal computer will continue to update itself. You can try and tell Microsoft that you have a metered connection and to only download and install the most vital updates. The most annoying fact is how the internet will cut off once you have used up your monthly allocation of data.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Payment and re-connectivity are simple enough, but not everyone has the funds to do so at all times. Having high-speed internet access on a portable mobile hotspot more than makes up for the higher-priced subscription charges, especially in the event that there is no other option available. Be prepared to monitor your usage, which means that you will have to be thrifty on how you get your data. Sitting down at your local Starbucks with a pair of headphones is a nice way to do so, thanks in part to their hotspot, which is offered free of charge. Regardless of the service provider, always ensure that there is no data cap.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-737054717"&gt;SPEED&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The next aspect that you should be on the lookout for is the speed of your internet connection. You want to have a fast enough connection that results in an enjoyable experience when compared to the frustration of having a slow internet connection. Whenever any service provider quotes a speed, be aware of the wording. Speeds are always advertised according to the words &lt;STRONG&gt;Up To&lt;/STRONG&gt;, therefore, pay close attention since you won't always be able to achieve the advertised download speed. You should also take a look at your actual requirements, a stable 4 Mbps internet connection is good enough for streaming and playing video games. Remember, you should always have the ability to increase your download speed according to your requirements. If you require a simple internet connection then 1-2 Mbps will be recommended for light browsing and accessing emails. Now if you happen to have multiple users in your home, then 25-50 Mbps per second may be required.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-540541212"&gt;IS THE PRICE RIGHT?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The next thing that you want to make sure of is the price that you’re being charged for the service is actually, in fact, the right price. Most service providers will offer you a promotional rate for 1-2 years where afterwards the cost will increase to possibly double the price. It may make sense to bundle the services together even if you aren’t currently in the market for cable or telephone services. At times, you may be able to secure a longer promotion for the same price as an Internet-only package by bundling the telephone service together. LocalCableDeals and other such providers that offer you a one-stop shop to compare and choose an ISP make it worthwhile for you to bundle the home telephone services alongside your internet services without any contractual binds.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Always be sure to inquire what the regular charges for the internet services will be after your promotion expires. Make sure to take into consideration that adding additional services makes you eligible for another promotion, which is just more value for your money.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;IFRAME src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zP1mKwMUa8k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"&gt;&lt;/IFRAME&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The SAP Road Map Explorer was recently &lt;A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/06/15/sap-road-map-explorer-the-new-way-of-viewing-road-maps/?update=updated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;released&lt;/A&gt; to help SAP customers customize road maps according to their needs.&amp;nbsp;In 5 simple steps, customers can navigate the tool in an easy and intuitive way.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;To first access the tool, log-in with your S-user credentials or you can create an account for free on &lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/welcome#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;roadmaps.sap.com&lt;/A&gt;. Then, simply follow the steps below to start exploring:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1060682973"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #1: Search for your topic &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There are 3 ways you can view a road map: 1) Browse on the top according to a product, industry, or business processes, 2) Use the search bar to type the topic of your choice, or 3) Click on the “Most viewed Road Maps” at the bottom.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tip:&lt;/STRONG&gt; As you type on the search bar, suggestions will appear, and you can choose which one best fit your search. Currently, “free-text” functionality or typing freely on the search bar is not available so please choose one of the suggestions to yield the best results.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-1.png" border="0" width="250" height="280" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="font-style: italic; font-family: SAPRegular, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center;"&gt;Landing Page&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-864169468"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #2: Customize with filters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On top of the Kanban board, there are 5 categories you can choose from: Products, Processes, Industries, Focus Topics, and Suite Qualities. Numbers on the right side of filters indicate show many innovations will appear if you choose that filter. Filters will only appear if there are innovations available to show so you’ll never experience 0 results. The Time Horizon on the right allows you to manually select quarters from past and future years.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tip: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Choosing 2+ filters within the same category (i.e. choosing 2 products) follows the “OR” formula. Innovations with Product A &lt;EM&gt;or&lt;/EM&gt; Product B will appear on the Kanban board. Choosing 2+ filters from different categories (i.e. choosing 1 product and 1 industry) follows the “AND” formula. This means the Explorer will show innovations that contain Product A&lt;EM&gt; and&lt;/EM&gt; Industry B.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-2-1.png" border="0" width="525" height="221" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Filters on the Kanban board&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-2-pt-2.png" border="0" width="183" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Time Horizon Filter&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-667655963"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #3: Explore innovations on the Kanban board&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Kanban board is the page that showcases all the innovations (or product features) in quarters. Use the left/right scrolls to browse through the road map. Each quarter column has arrows on the top right – click on each one to change your view preferences of the innovations (collapse or expand the innovation cards).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Click on each innovation card or box to view more details such as the innovation description and benefits. Planned innovations will have additional information such as features and the technical view.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tip:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Use the “star” button to favorite certain innovations that stand out to you! This makes it easier to spot innovations on the Kanban board.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-3-1.png" border="0" width="525" height="184" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Kanban Board&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-3-pt-2.png" border="0" width="324" height="263" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Innovation Details&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-471142458"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #4: Share with your colleagues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The top right of each innovation card has a share button, giving you a link to copy and paste. Once you save your road map and/or innovations, “My Road Maps” on the top right of your page will also have a sharing link.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-4.png" border="0" width="518" height="242" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Sharing Feature&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-274628953"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #5: Save &amp;amp; Download&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The top right corner of the Kanban board has a “Save” button which allows you to save the full road map you created with the selected filters. Easily access them later under “My Road Maps”. If you want to save certain innovations, click on the “+” button beside the innovation name to add it to your “Innovation List”, which you can also access under “My Road Maps”.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Lastly, a download button is available beside the “Download” button, which will automatically produce an Excel file with all innovations pertaining to the road map you created.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-5-1.png" border="0" width="324" height="190" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Save &amp;amp; Download Feature&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-5-pt-2.png" border="0" width="289" height="271" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Innovation Set Feature&lt;/P&gt;

We're just so used to getting like deliveries in one day or in two days. And we want our experience to be the same, whether it's in a physical store or like online, or if I call for a call center.

You know, there's a huge opportunity in retail by if you think of the retail of the future, providing a connected retail experience where the customer can sort of just go and like check out if we want, you know, without having exactly, um, the huge opportunities in smart cities, right?

And if there's a time to want to share your data, I think this is absolutely the best purpose that I've ever heard of.

Then, simply follow the steps below to start exploring:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1060684701"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #1: Search for your topic &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There are 3 ways you can view a road map: 1) Browse on the top according to a product, industry, or business processes, 2) Use the search bar to type the topic of your choice, or 3) Click on the “Most viewed Road Maps” at the bottom.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tip:&lt;/STRONG&gt; As you type on the search bar, suggestions will appear, and you can choose which one best fit your search. Currently, “free-text” functionality or typing freely on the search bar is not available so please choose one of the suggestions to yield the best results.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-1.png" border="0" width="250" height="280" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="font-style: italic; font-family: SAPRegular, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center;"&gt;Landing Page&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-864171196"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #2: Customize with filters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;On top of the Kanban board, there are 5 categories you can choose from: Products, Processes, Industries, Focus Topics, and Suite Qualities. Numbers on the right side of filters indicate show many innovations will appear if you choose that filter. Filters will only appear if there are innovations available to show so you’ll never experience 0 results. The Time Horizon on the right allows you to manually select quarters from past and future years.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tip: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Choosing 2+ filters within the same category (i.e. choosing 2 products) follows the “OR” formula. Innovations with Product A &lt;EM&gt;or&lt;/EM&gt; Product B will appear on the Kanban board. Choosing 2+ filters from different categories (i.e. choosing 1 product and 1 industry) follows the “AND” formula. This means the Explorer will show innovations that contain Product A&lt;EM&gt; and&lt;/EM&gt; Industry B.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-2-1.png" border="0" width="525" height="221" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Filters on the Kanban board&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-2-pt-2.png" border="0" width="183" height="240" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Time Horizon Filter&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-667657691"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #3: Explore innovations on the Kanban board&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Kanban board is the page that showcases all the innovations (or product features) in quarters. Use the left/right scrolls to browse through the road map. Each quarter column has arrows on the top right – click on each one to change your view preferences of the innovations (collapse or expand the innovation cards).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Click on each innovation card or box to view more details such as the innovation description and benefits. Planned innovations will have additional information such as features and the technical view.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tip:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Use the “star” button to favorite certain innovations that stand out to you! This makes it easier to spot innovations on the Kanban board.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-3-1.png" border="0" width="525" height="184" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Kanban Board&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-3-pt-2.png" border="0" width="324" height="263" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Innovation Details&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-471144186"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #4: Share with your colleagues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The top right of each innovation card has a share button, giving you a link to copy and paste. Once you save your road map and/or innovations, “My Road Maps” on the top right of your page will also have a sharing link.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-4.png" border="0" width="518" height="242" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Sharing Feature&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-274630681"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step #5: Save &amp;amp; Download&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The top right corner of the Kanban board has a “Save” button which allows you to save the full road map you created with the selected filters. Easily access them later under “My Road Maps”. If you want to save certain innovations, click on the “+” button beside the innovation name to add it to your “Innovation List”, which you can also access under “My Road Maps”.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Lastly, a download button is available beside the “Download” button, which will automatically produce an Excel file with all innovations pertaining to the road map you created.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-5-1.png" border="0" width="324" height="190" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"&gt;Save &amp;amp; Download Feature&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 0px;"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/06/Step-5-pt-2.png" border="0" width="289" height="271" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;

    <content>While it's clear that there is no shortage of smart-city initiatives taking place around the globe, the outcomes up to this point have been mixed. Even though a considerable amount of time, energy and money have been invested, only a limited number of sustainable, repeatable solutions that have emerged as a result.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Despite this, the effort to meaningfully improve the way people interact with their cities - carry on. It's a situation that Boston found itself in during 2017, when officials began to see the possibilities for modern technology to create new and improved services for residents. At that time, Boston began to look for innovative new ways to help commuters struggling with parking and transportation. They also were trying to address the concerns of their citizens who were worried about unchecked development, affordable rent, sustainability and safety.&amp;nbsp; Boston took a proactive approach to progress.&amp;nbsp; They used a platform to collect input (especially data) from their citizens that they can then use to co-design new ways to live, work and operate. They prioritized delivering as much value as possible in terms of greater responsiveness, more unique and personalized experiences, inclusiveness and of course, community connection.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The cities that do this will thrive in a future that is far closer than many realize. The ones that don’t will not only miss out on incredible gains from urban transformation, but they'll also wind up losing their citizens' trust.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Harnessing the Power of the People to a City's Advantage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/11/diversity_isell.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;A href="https://insights.sap.com/creating-the-cities-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;According to one recent survey&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;that gathered input from more than 6,000 people living in Australia, France, Germany, Singapore, the UK and the US, people overwhelmingly want the areas they live in to focus on the digital delivery of public services, greater personalization and easier, more secure ways to share and access data moving forward. 42% of respondents, for example, said that they would be more than happy to use the Internet of Things to share their personal data in exchange for things like service improvements. &lt;STRONG&gt;A staggering 45% of people said that they were willing to participate in focus groups or spend time on committees to improve the services they already use&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Despite this, many cities are not actively exploring a way to involve their citizens in the types of smart-city initiatives that they are currently executing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://aisel.aisnet.org/bise/vol60/iss3/2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;A team of researchers from the journal Business &amp;amp; Information Systems Engineering said in 2018&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;that one of the major reasons why smart cities fail to meet their core objectives comes down to not appropriately involving citizens or considering the impact of their initiatives on those citizens.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
A major mistake that far too many of these cities make involves seeing their citizens for exactly what they AREN'T. Rather than looking at them as users, testers or consumers, they need to be the producers and sources of creativity and innovation that they truly are.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But while designing projects that aim to better understand citizens' needs and engage them is certainly a start, it is also just one small part of a much larger story. Equally important is a city's ability to provide platforms that enable their citizens to participate in the creation of their bold new urban experience. Citizens, businesses, university researchers and others need to be able to work together to co-innovate and solve urban problems in smarter and more sophisticated ways. There must be a shared, collaborative framework between all key stakeholders that allows them to drive desired outcomes across the board.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Many commercial platforms are already doing this. In the world of fitness, for just one example, developers regularly release apps that bring users together by way of crowd sourced routes, leader boards, competitions and more. By adapting these kinds of ideas for the urban environment, cities can become what they were always meant to be: innovation hubs.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
But none of that will be possible if cities aren't ready to listen to begin with.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;A href="https://population.un.org/wup/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;According to a 2018 projection offered by the United Nations&lt;/A&gt;, 68% of the world's population will live in cities by as soon as 2050. During that time, challenges to economic development, social inclusion, mobility, housing and even quality of life will continue to grow if left unchecked. Cities must get smarter in order to adequately address them, and citizens must be at the heart of those efforts.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Cities who take a more proactive approach to advancing this future where constituents can provide &amp;nbsp;input to co-design new ways to live, work, and do business will enjoy a period of significant economic growth and prosperity. Those that don't will fail to grow - ultimately leading to an exodus of citizens and a slow, inevitable decline in their wake.&lt;BR /&gt;

&lt;BR /&gt;
In this blog post, we want to have a look at 5G, and what capabilities are required to get started on the 5G monetization journey. We will go over the following questions:&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ What is 5G and why is it different?&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ what will 5G business models look like?&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ what are the key capabilities required to get started on the 5G monetization journey&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ how can SAP Billing and Revenue Innovation Management help you on the journey?&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
So let’s start by taking a look at &lt;STRONG&gt;what is 5G and why is it different&lt;/STRONG&gt;?&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Following high growth from the first through to the third generation of services, growth has slowed in 4G due to disruption by platform and over the top, or OTT providers who bypass telcos to provide their services directly to consumers. As a result, many telcos have not achieved the return on investment that they had envisaged.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
5G offers the opportunity to get back to creating and capturing value by collaborating with partners to provide industry solution via three types of use cases:&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
1. extreme Mobile Broadband (eMBB)&lt;BR /&gt;
2. massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC)&lt;BR /&gt;
3. Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC)&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/12/5G.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
This brings endless possibilities of products and services across industries, for example:&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ travel and transportation&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ Smart cities&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ Supply chain and manufacturing&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;⦁ Healthcare and wellness&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ work and play&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/12/5G-industry-solutions-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
To offer these industry solutions, new business models are required. These business models are taking shape already with the current 4G technology.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
You may already be familiar with the B2X business model where telcos provide services directly to consumers and businesses, with some partners involved in providing devices, content and apps.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
We also have the agent business model where telcos act as a payment providers, for example via mobile wallets or direct carrier billing.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
We also have wholesale business models where telcos provide wholesale connectivity to other telcos and to mobile virtual network operators.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
All of these business are converging to the B2B2X business model. With 5G, the B2B2X business model is likely to become more prominent with industry solutions where telcos will provide network connectivity in the form of network slices, to industry solution providers, who will in turn provide services to consumers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Telcos will have the additional opportunity to provide Billing on Behalf of the industry solution providers, to the end consumers, and in doing turn the billing cost centre into a profit centre.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/12/B2B2X.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
So the next question is&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;what are the capabilities required to enable the B2B2X business model&lt;/STRONG&gt;? Lets take a look.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
There are four key capabilities required for B2B2X:&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ the first is &lt;STRONG&gt;enterprise billing&lt;/STRONG&gt; as this is the means to manage revenue from services delivered to industry solution providers. This includes billing for solutions and outcomes, managing master agreements and customer hierarchies. Tiered pricing and discounts and consolidated invoicing across customer hierarchies are essential features.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ the second capability is &lt;STRONG&gt;revenue sharing&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Schemes for partner revenue sharing and settlement are essential to support ecosystems of companies joining forces to deliver services.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ the third capability is &lt;STRONG&gt;billing and financial convergence&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Coexistence with legacy services and systems is key to ensuring both feasibility and viability. Delivering new capabilities with a short lead time and avoiding large scale overhaul of billing systems can mean the difference between success and failure. You may decide to converge on a single subledger to manage both receivables and payables, along with payments and collections. Or you may go a step further to provide invoicing convergence, and allow the end customer the option to receive a single bill with all charges consolidated.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ the final capability is &lt;STRONG&gt;mediation&lt;/STRONG&gt; which is the foundation for the other 3 capabilities. Mediation means processing massive volumes of data from various sources to derive business meaning from the data. Data can come from the core, from the edge or from partner applications and APIs. Also this must all come together in real-time.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/12/5G-capabilities-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
The &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Billing and Revenue Innovation Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; solution enables all the capabilities required to get started on the 5G monetization journey.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It covers the end to end order to cash process, and includes the following modules:&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ &lt;STRONG&gt;Subscription Order Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; to manage subscriptions and contracts&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Convergent Mediation by DigitalRoute&lt;/STRONG&gt; to collect usage&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Convergent Charging&lt;/STRONG&gt; to price and charge for usage&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Convergent Invoicing&lt;/STRONG&gt; to bill and settle with customers and partners&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
⦁ &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Customer Financial Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; to handle payments, manage credit and collections, and provide financial customer care.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Benchmarking data from case studies have shown that SAP customers have realized a lot of value by implementing the solution. Here you can see some examples of tangible benefits reported by customers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2020/12/BRIM-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;

    <title>Removing Friction from the B2B Digital Commerce Experience</title>

    <content>&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/01/287437_GettyImages-1139805930-1-scaled.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
In the business-to-business (B2B) world, offering a smart and frictionless e-commerce experience is no longer an option.&amp;nbsp;When it comes to meeting buyers’ expectations, the bar has never been higher.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As expectations continue to rise, the importance of digital channels for B2B companies has grown significantly, increasing rapidly during the time of COVID-19. As such, more B2B companies are investing heavily in the customer experience to simplify the customer journey and remove points of friction.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
One of the key elements of an optimal customer experience is ease of use. Customers expect an intuitive and straightforward shopping experience and one that’s simple to complete. This means making it easy for customers to find the products and services they are looking for while reducing the number of steps it takes to finalize an order, even if it’s a complex, multifaceted product or service.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Underlying ease of use, there must be a nuanced pricing strategy that is consistent and unique to customers across all channels. For leading B2B companies, this comes to life as a personalized omnichannel buying experience with dynamically generated pricing mirroring deals made between customers and sales representatives.&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/01/Tessco-Blog-Graphic-Middle-2.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Perfecting the customer experience to deliver more value &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
On a journey to digitalize its operations, Maryland-based TESSCO Technologies Incorporated (Tessco), a value-added distributor of wireless communications products, embarked upon a greenfield implementation of SAP S/4HANA. Taking the opportunity to overhaul its e-commerce storefront at the same time, the business sought help from the SAP Innovative Business Solutions organization to move to a new solution in the cloud.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As a distributor, Tessco serves a wide variety of customers and supports accounts with unique pricing conditions negotiated through sales its reps. To deliver a true omnichannel experience to customers, Tessco needed an e-commerce solution that allowed it to reflect these individual pricing deals across all customer touch points. To make this work, Tessco sought a solution that offered native integration with Intelligent ERP to draw on consistent product information and generate dynamic pricing.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Meeting these needs, Tessco adopted the SAP Commerce Cloud solution, leveraging SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite to connect the technology to the Intelligent ERP. Tight integration of SAP S/4HANA and SAP Commerce Cloud allows the organization to unite data. This heightens the purchasing experience for customers with product information for more than 65,000 stock-keeping units embedded in the e-commerce experience.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Whether customers interact with the organization through sales reps or using the Web site – the experience is the same. Customers placing orders through multiple channels can view them all through the site. And pricing is consistent, with new quoting functionality allowing customers to generate quotes on the Web site based on prenegotiated rates.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Together with consistent pricing, Tessco is able to offer an end-to end experience with self-serve value-added customizations. This allows the business to ease customer transactions on variant configuration products ­from its Web site. So, for coax cable, which is cut to length based on customer needs, or antennas, which are tuned to frequency ranges requested by the customer, purchasing these products to their exact specifications has never been easier.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With SAP solutions in place, Tessco is able to offer fluid omnichannel experiences befitting any leading business-to-business or business-to-consumer organization.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;2021 SAP Innovation Awards &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Tessco’s digital transformation and obsession with the customer experience are being recognized as part of the 2021 SAP Innovation Awards, which offers a showcase of SAP customers’ innovative thinking and successes. &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/submission-details-2021.html?idea_id=2164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;View Tessco’s nomination in this year’s awards&lt;/A&gt; to discover how the value-added distributor is able to offer an end-to-end purchasing experience for its complex telecommunications products.</content>

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1087497596"&gt;Creating New Vertical Market Opportunities with Partners&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Given the low latency and other capabilities associated with advanced versions of next-generation networks, 5G can help Communication Service Providers (CSPs) become purveyors of digital services. 5G networks can lead to more usage-based discrete interactions, in real time, based on autonomous, fully automated operational transactions residing in &lt;STRONG&gt;digital partner ecosystems&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
5G networks offer telcos an opportunity to capture value in transactions by collaborating with partners that in turn play an integral role in the development of the next generation of services. CSPs can do so in a variety of ways as 5G makes use of &lt;STRONG&gt;cases across many industry verticals&lt;/STRONG&gt; possible, whether it's travel and transportation, as smart cities, smart homes, supply chain and manufacturing, or healthcare and wellness.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The digital ecosystem that creates the use cases could include software vendors, system integrators, hyperscalers, and network equipment producers if not other partner types to offer services that result in billable events.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
CSPs, as part of a &lt;STRONG&gt;B2B2X model&lt;/STRONG&gt;, can provide network slices to industry solution providers that can use 5G connectivity to deliver services to their customers. The industry solution providers may not have a billing relationship with consumers, creating for the telecom provider an opportunity to provide billing services on behalf of the partner.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The partners' ecosystem can deliver specific services for&amp;nbsp; reaching better quality, lower latency (or minimum video quality), and bandwidth requirements that advanced 5G networks make possible such as augmented reality, drone video, and network slicing.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
5G networks can enable &lt;STRONG&gt;dynamic real-time operations&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;monetization functionalities&lt;/STRONG&gt; that are critical for managing use cases delivered with the help of their networks and partners in a B2B2X model. Unfortunately, the billing systems employed by many CSPs today are designed to address a static service definition and delivery process, with results usually measured in hours or days.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
So, a new breed of OSS/BSS solutions needs to be developed so that CSPs have the agility necessary to grow revenue, support service-level guarantees, and help them adapt more readily to changing business conditions.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
B2B2X in a 5G context requires four key capabilities.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Billing &lt;/STRONG&gt;to manage revenue from services delivered to industry solution providers. This includes the ability to bill for business solutions and business outcomes that are industry-tailored, potentially involving hardware, software, support, and services, and have value-based KPIs and metrics associated and involve providing service credits where service-level agreements are not met.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Partner Revenue Share and Settlement&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Ecosystems of partners collaborating to deliver services, where platform partners, content providers, app developers, advertisers, or even local authorities in the case of public services, all require revenue to be shared.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Convergence.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Coexistence with legacy services and systems is needed to ensure feasibility and viability. Delivering capabilities with a short lead time and avoiding large-scale billing replacement can mean the difference between success and failure. Operators may converge on a single sub-ledger to manage receivables and payables, collections, and payments to give a complete view of customer and partner financials and ensure a single consolidated invoice with all charges. It may even be necessary to cater to multiple convergence strategies concurrently.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Mediation&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the foundational capability required as making business sense of data in the 5G context means picking needles out of haystacks by processing massive volumes of data from various sources in different formats and with complex dependencies. Data from different network slices, from the edge, transport and central data centers and from partner applications and APIs, can potentially form the parameters for billing and settlement in real time.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Decision makers within the ranks of CSPs do see the need to act. According to IDC's Global Telco Survey conducted last year, &lt;STRONG&gt;63% of respondents are planning or currently transforming their services portfolios&lt;/STRONG&gt; and 58% are focusing on increasing operational agility or speed to market, which is fundamental to OSS/BSS transformation. In other words, operational automation and OSS/BSS transformation are typically believed to be primary elements of a CSP's broader business transformation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-890984091"&gt;Emerging Monetization Models&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
New billing systems become necessary to properly monetize the new 5G services they want to provide in a B2B2X model. CSPs need to record and standardize disparate transactions that emanate from the services and transform them into comprehensible and payable invoices for customers to prevent potential problems such as revenue leakage.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Furthermore, CSPs need to be able to &lt;STRONG&gt;add and modify services as well as adjust pricing swiftly&lt;/STRONG&gt; to demonstrate value to clients while also being able to scale effectively.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
5G services have highly variable service attributes (e.g., bandwidth, latency, and service quality) that mandate a different approach to pricing based on the complexity and value of the interaction. Legacy billing systems employed by CSPs aren't flexible or agile enough for them to properly monetize 5G services. Again, CSPs will need to support a range of use cases, such as smart small and large appliances and home security that emanate perhaps from IoT devices.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With such use cases in place, CSPs will need to &lt;STRONG&gt;support a broader range of service plans that better reflect consumption&lt;/STRONG&gt; with the help of real-time network functions that allow them to scale usage up or down and provide preferential bandwidth.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The massive connection density of standalone 5G networks, for example, will mandate real-time usage measurement given the many devices in need of support. That's unlike today, as CSPs bill based upon 4G data consumed to send and receive emails and browse the web on a monthly basis, for example.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To ensure 5G-enabled services can be properly monetized, a different approach to&amp;nbsp; infrastructure operations is required. Swisscom, Telia, Telefónica, and Telecom Italia, are just a few examples that have embarked upon legacy technology and service phaseout initiatives with more agile service enablement and 5G-driven digital services in mind.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-694470586"&gt;Three Reasons Why Quote-to-Cash Architecture is Key&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Inflexible architectures, high maintenance costs, and new requirements mean that most CSPs will need to upgrade systems if they want to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving, 5G-driven, digital services environment.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Billing systems employed by CSPs simply weren't built to address new requirements like dynamic network configuration, continuous quality of service monitoring, partner ecosystem management, and r&lt;STRONG&gt;eal-time multidimensional charging&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Yet, CSPs will have to provide customers with the ability to order services, provide&lt;STRONG&gt; dynamic quotes/pricing&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and manage the processes with minimal effort. 5G will lead to a strong omni-channel ecosystem and drive lifetime value-oriented customer experiences. Furthermore, 5G networks will make for many touch-points, such as IoT devices and connected cars, that are maintained by customers in addition to traditional channels. &lt;STRONG&gt;Partner management&lt;/STRONG&gt; and settlement of relationships will play a critical role in complex partner-enabled 5G business models as well.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Order management&lt;/STRONG&gt; will therefore play a bigger role as it will have to enable the ordering of complex 5G services to support real-time delivery of these complex multi-component, on-demand services for business and mass-market consumers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Unless CSPs rejuvenate their telecom operations and business system stacks, the maximization of 5G-related revenue becomes a more difficult prospect.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-497957081"&gt;How to Succeed and Unlock Value&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Telcos are increasingly turning to IT vendors and software companies for help as IT and software design principles are required for help with the operational transformation. As part of a Global Telco Survey last year conducted by IDC, CSP decision makers claimed that the implementation of DevOps/agile processes (68%) and the adoption of processes/practices from the IT or OTT world (63%) were the most important factors to ensure a successful digital transformation.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The time to act is sooner rather than later as &lt;STRONG&gt;CSPs need to update their operations, orchestration, and monetization systems/processes to better manage the demands 5G networks will place on them&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Dedicating the right resources to the development of digital business models is essential. CSPs should start to build agile, multidisciplinary teams that develop software-driven products in discrete areas, across product and system value chains. CSPs can also create digital business models by leveraging IT, software, and cloud vendors as well as digital platform suppliers and technology specialists while simultaneously managing legacy telecom equipment suppliers during the transition period.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <title>Services Industries: Transformation-ready and primed for growth</title>

    <content>When &lt;EM&gt;Deloitte&lt;/EM&gt; Africa– which provides professional services across 17 countries &amp;nbsp;– sought to replace its disparate and legacy systems, it embarked on a digital transformation journey. Armed with an &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/03/5449d9c2-897d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;intelligent solution&lt;/A&gt;, it leveraged automation, standardized business processes, digitized user experience and improved overall governance.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
No industry is immune from disruption. As technology-driven innovations transform the way services are consumed, competition in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Services Industries&lt;/STRONG&gt; is stiff. Organizations and industries that were already on the path of digital transformation weathered the pandemic-induced global unrest better than most others. And now, businesses strive for growth in a new digital environment.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Services Industries&lt;/STRONG&gt; comprise of Engineering, Construction and Operations, Higher Education and Research, Media, Professional Services, Sports and Entertainment, &amp;nbsp;Telecommunications and Travel and Transportation industries. Each was impacted differently by the pandemic and yet commonalities exist between them as companies and organizations prioritize digital transformation and migration to the cloud.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Dynamic and Diverse &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The Services Industries have always been laser-focused on their customers, by nature. But now, emerging trends present this cluster with a new set of challenges to overcome, as well as new opportunities to capture.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
From global logistics and telco-driven communications, to workforce management and digital content, Services companies and organizations must collectively find innovative solutions to better serve customers while providing an extraordinary customer experience.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Disruption and continuity are two sides of the same coin for the &lt;STRONG&gt;Engineering, Construction and Operations industry&lt;/STRONG&gt;. By 2050, cities will house two-thirds of the human population and yet, three-quarters of the buildings that will exist in 2050 are still to be conceived. This translates to huge growth, billions of components, thousands of suppliers and high productivity. With a connected supply chain to reduce labor costs and improve margins, construction companies must build technologically advanced buildings which are carbon neutral and &lt;A href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2021/07/30/taking-action-for-a-sustainable-future/?sh=b539379434b4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;sustainable&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As universities closed campuses in the wake of the pandemic, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Higher Education and Research&lt;/STRONG&gt; community responded with virtual classrooms and online student engagement innovations. A &lt;A href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291120300905" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/A&gt; showed that around 50% of the higher education students surveyed during the pandemic found online learning to actually improve their technical skills when compared to face-to-face classes. Also, majority of the respondents (70%) were ready to opt for online classes to manage the curriculum during this pandemic. Clearly, digital learning interventions are here to stay.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
In the last three months of 2020, global streaming grew 44% when compared to the same period in 2019. &lt;A href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/02/16/netflix-amazon-streaming-video-disney-hulu-hbo-max-peacock/6759020002/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Reports&lt;/A&gt; show that consumers that maintained three streaming subscriptions before the pandemic, now have five. With consumers seeking an enriched experience, the market opportunity in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Media&lt;/STRONG&gt; industry lies with digitization of the customer experience. Growth plans will now hinge on predicting the streaming consumer’s needs, up-selling content and cross-selling corresponding services.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The pandemic arrested mobility and hurt the &lt;STRONG&gt;Travel and Transportation&lt;/STRONG&gt; industry immensely. But thanks to &lt;STRONG&gt;Cargo Transportation &amp;amp; Logistics&lt;/STRONG&gt; companies, the world keeps moving ahead. Intelligent technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will heighten customer experience by providing real-time location and status of shipment. Also, digitizing customer experiences, adopting intelligent operations and asset management will be central to future growth strategies.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
With basic tasks being automated and firms developing digital knowledge-based products and &lt;A href="https://www.inc.com/jonathan-rhodes/how-to-monetize-your-companys-in-house-knowledge.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;outcome-based services&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Professional Services&lt;/STRONG&gt; providers are now working to grow revenues without increasing the workforce, while delivering their services in a hybrid or virtual environment. Clients&amp;nbsp; seek outstanding outcomes and personalization. Firms are providing clients the benefit of not having to invest in an on-premise solution and instead offering ready-to-deploy solutions and SaaS products that provide on-demand access to services such as tax advice or &lt;A href="https://www.lumen.com/en-us/managed-it-services/big-data-as-a-service.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;business analytics&lt;/A&gt; for example.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
By 2024, the global sports analytics &lt;A href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sports-analytics-market-worth-5-2-billion-by-2024--exclusive-report-by-marketsandmarkets-300986511.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;market size&lt;/A&gt; is expected to hit $5.2 Billion. With advancements in technology, performance data makes the difference between champion athletes and the rest of the field. Going forward, comprehensive solutions for player performance data, player contract analysis, fan engagement and ticketing will become game-changers in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Sports and Entertainment&lt;/STRONG&gt; industry and help both players and franchises stay ahead of the game.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The &lt;STRONG&gt;Telecommunications&lt;/STRONG&gt; industry is critical to how people and businesses interact. Across the world, 4.3 billion users access the internet via mobile devices. And per &lt;A href="http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation/wp-content/blogs.dir/94/mp/files/pages/files/dti-telecommunications-industry-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;reports&lt;/A&gt;, the expected value of the cumulative operating profit through 2025 for the telecom industry is a staggering US$1.2 Trillion. With 5G on the horizon, companies that personalize end-to-end customer experiences and diversify their revenue streams will be better placed to compete with disrupters and new market entrants.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology Transformation as an Enabler&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As the world changes rapidly, large-scale enterprises as well as emerging players are challenged to keep pace with new data-driven business models and digital technologies that create growth opportunities.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Our &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/industries/industry-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Industry Cloud&lt;/A&gt; powered ‘transformation-as-a-service’ solutions help customers &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;rise&lt;/A&gt; by removing complexity and simplifying engagement with timely transformation interventions.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As the next phase of market evolution emerges, it is imperative that Services companies and organizations adapt, display flexibility and adopt technology to stay resilient. Accessing industry next-generation practices via Industry Cloud will become key to foster innovation, secure regulatory compliance and achieve effective collaboration with partners and customers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Thus, with rapid innovation and Industry Cloud powered transformation, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Services Industries&lt;/STRONG&gt; are primed for growth in the post-pandemic world.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <title>How Does a Major Telco Provider Create a Unified, Multinational Customer Experience?</title>

    <content>&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/11/Blog-Graphic-One.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
As one of the region’s leading telecommunication providers, Liberty Latin America Ltd. keeps millions of people and businesses in Latin America connected.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Operating across Latin America, including Chile, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and others, Liberty Latin America has a customer base that is extremely broad and diverse. Not only is there variation in services and product bundles across different regions, there is also a mix of customer economics, scale, and need. For example, in the Cayman Islands, the average customer spend is much higher than Jamaica, just next door.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
These types of variations can be readily addressed at brick-and-mortar retail stores, but managing this through digital sales presented a challenge. Liberty Latin America knew it needed a robust &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/e-commerce-platforms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;e-commerce platform&lt;/A&gt; to enhance and unify its digital customer experience. Then the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of retail stores – giving a new urgency to the project. As Ed Sherwood-Smith, Senior Director, Digital Platform Delivery at Liberty Latin America, explains, “We were going to build the most perfect digital experience across Latin America in a very measured and controlled way, with a three-year road map. Then the whole world changed – everyone was quarantined – and we had to go digital right away. We knew we were going to need a really strong, flexible e-commerce engine.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
The goal for Liberty Latin America was to build a single e-commerce platform that could support all its markets. “There was no way we could go market by market and customize each time,” says Sherwood-Smith. “It would take way too long and would create additional costs in terms of maintenance and future developments. We needed one platform that could provide a user-friendly and unified customer experience while also giving us the flexibility to meet region-specific requirements.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/11/LLA-Social-Media-Card.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;Enter SAP Commerce Cloud solutions.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Not only do SAP Commerce Cloud solutions provide advanced business-to-consumer and business-to-business capabilities, but they also can be customized to manage a variety of catalogs, products, and configurations for creating exceptional, hyperpersonalized omnichannel experiences. Plus, the flexibility and scalability of the cloud mean it can be deployed quickly in new markets and integrated with various CRM systems as needed without exorbitant on-premise infrastructure costs.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To get its new e-commerce platform up and running as quickly as possible, Liberty Latin America also took advantage of the telco and utilities accelerator for the SAP Commerce solution. “We started planning in June,” explains Sherwood-Smith, “and were live in four months. By October, we were accepting orders in Jamaica, then in Panama by December. Puerto Rico was in February, and by April, we were live in Costa Rica.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
As Liberty Latin America launched the initial e-commerce stores using the out of the box storefront capabilities , it has also started working with advanced capabilities to start using eCommerce APIs directly to build a true headless Digital experience.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Another challenge for Liberty Latin America was to increase customer value along the customer lifecycle. That means making sure that once a customer has signed on for one service, they keep coming back for more. Again, this was fairly straightforward under the local store model, where sales people could make the direct case for bundles or packages. But engaging this way through digital channels would be difficult.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
To address the issue, Liberty Latin America deployed the SAP Emarsys Customer Engagement platform. “Now,” says Sherwood-Smith, “we can craft sales in a way that enables targeted cross-selling and up-selling so that we can help customers experience our services better and increase revenue at the same time.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Going forward, Liberty Latin America will continue to roll out its new e-commerce platform to current and future markets – from Montserrat, where it has tens of customers, to Panama, where it has many more.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Customer data management is also top of mind – putting SAP Customer Data Cloud solutions next on the list for deployment. “While we’re not dealing with the kind of data privacy regulations you have in Europe,” says Sherwood-Smith, “most of the places where we operate have some type of nascent privacy and data protection program in place. As things get stricter, we need to be ready.”&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
“The ultimate goal is to drive more traffic through our digital channels. From customer engagement to customer creation and to the actual sale – we want it all going through the same digital platform. SAP Customer Experience solutions are going to help get us there.”&lt;BR /&gt;

    <title>The Road to TM Forum Compliance - SAP Commerce Cloud, telco and utilities accelerator</title>

    <content>&lt;SPAN data-contrast="auto"&gt;What is it to be a TM Forum compliant solution in the Telco industry? As Telco providers reach unpredictable acceleration paces, software solutions need to follow the rhythm of innovations and provide a standardized and solid architecture. SAP Commerce Cloud, telco and utilities accelerator s leading this journey and our first TM Forum certification is just the beginning. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN data-contrast="auto"&gt;SAP is not new to Digital Commerce and has had a dedicated Telco commerce solution for many years; but in May 2018, the SAP Commerce Cloud, telco and utilities accelerator started down its own digital eCommerce transformation path to becoming a TM Forum compliant solution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN data-ccp-props="{&amp;quot;201341983&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;335551550&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335551620&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;335559739&amp;quot;:160,&amp;quot;335559740&amp;quot;:259}"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;

&lt;P style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Solution for Telecommunications Reaches Silver Tier in the TM Forum Open API Conformance Certification Program&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
During my years working in the Telecommunications industry, I learned that Telco Service Providers who choose to implement software that follows globally established standards and industry best practices not only makes everything work smoothly and efficiently but provides the foundation to create innovative offerings and maximize their revenue.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
At SAP my goal as a Solution Owner is to build the best software that Telecommunications companies can rely on to implement and elevate their customer's journeys at every level. &amp;nbsp;For this reason, we decided to make our solution, the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/TELCO_ACCELERATOR/2202/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Commerce Cloud telco and utilities accelerator&lt;/A&gt;, pursue the best standards for the industry, which meant aligning and implementing the TM Forum SID data model and TM Forum APIs in our architecture.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Obtaining TM Forum Conformance Certification is a fantastic reward for the SAP Telecommunications team, and one to be proud of. &amp;nbsp;Being recognized with a Silver Tier badge motivates us to keep up the work to build the finest Telecommunications omnichannel solution in the market.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
This achievement proves that our SAPs omnichannel commerce solution for CSPs successfully implemented TM Forum Open APIs and are consistent with TM Forum’s globally recognized standards and best practices.&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="https://www.tmforum.org/membership/current-members/member-profile/?id=0016000000T3nAJAAZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Our certified list thus far&lt;/A&gt;:&lt;BR /&gt;

    <title>Achieving Goals:  SAP Solution for Telecommunications Reaches Gold Tier in TM Forum Open API Conformance Certification Program</title>

    <content>It was one year ago when our SAP for Telecommunications solution SAP Commerce Cloud telco and utilities accelerator reached the Silver Tier status.&amp;nbsp; Today, we are Gold Tier certified.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/APIBadgeWshadow.GOLDwNewLogo.jpg" height="73" width="218" /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
We have continued our commitment to the &lt;A href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tmforum.org%2Foda%2Fopen-digital-architecture-open-api-manifesto%2F&amp;amp;esheet=52541738&amp;amp;newsitemid=20211130005179&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=TM+Forum%26%238217%3Bs+Open+Digital+Architecture+%28ODA%29+Manifesto&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=d6843e8723aef8b6a6ae5a326e8e9018" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;TM Forum’s Open Digital Architecture (ODA) Manifesto&lt;/A&gt;. SAP has worked over the past year to obtain certification for 10 APIs that enable communication service providers (CSPs) to standardize and lower the cost of integrating SAP into their IT and business support system (BSS) ecosystem.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
SAP is recognized as a leader within the telecommunications industry.&amp;nbsp; Companies who achieve TM Forum conformance certification for their solutions can formally demonstrate evidence that the implementation of the TM Forum APIs are consistent with the TM Forum’s globally recognized standards and industry best practices.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
It is a milestone, a true testament of all our hard work and efforts to drive digital business transformation, innovation and agility for SAP customers.&amp;nbsp; This achievement proves that SAPs omnichannel commerce solution for CSPs successfully implemented the following TM Forum Open APIs:&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF637 Product Inventory Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF651 Agreement Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF620 Product Catalog Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF622 Product Ordering Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF663 Shopping Cart&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF669 Party Role Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF632 Party Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF677 Usage Consumption Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF679 Product Offering Qualification&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;TMF673 Geographic Address Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Service Providers need solutions to automate an increasingly complex and dynamic portfolio of products and services; and reduce time to market.&amp;nbsp; The awarded conformance certification demonstrates that the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/crm/industries/telecommunications.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Commerce Cloud telco and utilities accelerator&lt;/A&gt; eases the orchestration of personalized experiences for Telecom administrators and their customers.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
Being TM Forum compliant ensures that SAP will fully support CSPs’ business integration with their existing systems (i.e., billing, OSS, BSS) and improve operational productivity, reduce costs, reduce risks, and increase ARPU.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Adopting a common language with customers and partners will result in market differentiation that will continue to unleash new business opportunities.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
So, what’s up next?&amp;nbsp; Platinum.&lt;BR /&gt;

    <title>Navigating the Generative AI Era: Blockchain is key for resilient cross-company communication</title>

    <content>&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Problem:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Generative AI will exponentially raise the amount of digital business assets a company will have to handle through automation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; To find the signal in the noise, on which digital assets really matter, Blockchain Technology can bring weight on what is important information and what is not by physical backed real world scarcity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;In the emerging digital age, technologies like &lt;STRONG&gt;Generative AI&lt;/STRONG&gt; are unlocking unprecedented possibilities. But while this power can also amplify challenges such as misinformation, fraud, and counterfeiting for businesses, blockchain technology can already provide the critical countermeasure against abuse when used together with Generative AI.&lt;BR /&gt;
This promising counterbalance ensures authenticity, protects against digital misconduct, and solidifies the future of a transparent and trustworthy online ecosystem. So, while harnessing the transformative potential of generative AI, we can be sure that the advancements of AI along with Blockchain technology will ensure us a productive return from the enterprise perspective. The key is efficient spam handling with “Blockchain Weighting” of digital assets.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Let’s go through the current Generative AI (GenAI) hype and try to understand what impact a mainstream use of AI Large Language Models (LLM) has on enterprises when it comes to the question “What if GenAI is used AGAINST enterprises?”.&lt;BR /&gt;
What harm can GenAI content do to enterprises?&lt;BR /&gt;
And how can enterprises be protected from a flood of generated potentially harmful content?&lt;BR /&gt;
Being confronted with an increasing amount of AI-generated material, from deepfakes and phishy communication to mass-produced fake invoices, individual “Fraud Crafting” is now an automated task from an attacker’s perspective.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;First, we’ll look at what’s currently happening in the tech industry, and then we’ll look at how blockchain technology can come to the rescue when AI is used as a weapon against businesses in the wrong hands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The AI Hype&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“AI” and in particular “GenAI” are certainly the buzzwords in the business world in 2023. There is no tech conference, business strategy or solution that does not consider GenAI today. There are ChatGPT, Bard, Midjourney, Copilot and many more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400;overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/AI-x-Blockchain-Hype.png" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;All companies, clearly including SAP, are putting considerable resources into establishing this new technology in their companies and accelerating growth. The momentum is enormous right now. Everywhere, experiments are beginning about where GenAI will help and where it wontBesides, generative AI images have already secretly won major photography and art competitions. ChatGPT, for example, brought a new dimension to texting.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="font-size: 1rem"&gt;Inspired by all these impressive generative advances, companies are looking for the best ways to transform business models through generative AI.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;GenAI Digital Asset Generation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;GenAI has changed the way and speed at which digital assets can be produced – a paradigm shift.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/GenAI-digital-asset-generation.png" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center;font-style: italic"&gt;GenAI digital asset generation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;From a corporate perspective, the digital assets produced by AI must be filtered by those digital assets effectively affecting how businesses are being built and deployed. Concretely, that means that art-related assets for example are not of direct interest when putting the businesses glasses on.&lt;BR /&gt;
But what are of direct interest, are workflows, invoices, contracts, code, or business communication of every possible way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;An AI Digital Asset Anarchy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Since GenAI Large Language Models (LLM) are a tool to achieve goals, it is only a matter of time before criminal energies will use LLMs for their own purposes.&amp;nbsp; And these are certainly against the natural interests of companies. Specifically, for their own enrichment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Illustratively, for example, fake invoices can cause millions of dollars in damage. This is not an “IF” but a common criminal practice. One criminal stole over $122 million from Facebook and Google by sending fake invoices. But this was manual work for the counterfeiter. Imagine an AI assistant is given a personal record of invoices from a company and is tasked with creating fake invoices that are supposed to be real vendor invoices for that company. While in the past it was easy to filter such generated approaches based on their poor quality, that’s exactly what will change with GenAI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400;overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/Generative-AI-incoming-spame-wave.png" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Consequently, in the near future, organizations will be confronted as well as mass bombarded with targeted and individualized fraud such as phishing, forgery, and social engineering over personal data sets. The quality and scale of these attacks will reach unimagined proportions due to generative AI automation.&lt;BR /&gt;
A thousand perfectly LLM-customized fake invoices built on an existing leaked company data set a day? What sounds like a nightmare for any accountant will soon become &amp;nbsp;reality.&lt;BR /&gt;
A filtering problem will arise – &amp;nbsp;how can companies distinguish between real digital assets such as legitimate invoices and perfectly crafted invoices with information about your habits, customers and suppliers embedded in the attacker’s LLM database?&lt;BR /&gt;
How can employees watch for suspicious signs of communication when the quality of fraud attempts is increasing every day, while at the same time being fully automated and thus no longer limited by human input?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
Social engineering attacks will be automated in chats and email conversations, and their quality will be so high that debunking them will be very time-consuming for enterprise-side recipients. A battle against windmills. Even with AI support to defend against these attacks, a high level of manual detection and verification will always be required. This is because artificial manipulations become more and more sophisticated, a constant race for concealing and detection.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400;overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/AI-Wave.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Once the targeted company’s business data and communication channels are accessible to an attacker, the manual work restriction is removed from the attacker’s perspective.&lt;BR /&gt;
Therefore, the number of attacks will multiply soon as criminals deploy GenAI technologies, and this technology evolves as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;This AI evolution has just begun.&lt;BR /&gt;
Businesses will face an inflationary volume problem of digital assets – &amp;nbsp;what is real and in need of our attention, what is just robbing us of resources in terms of time and review?&lt;BR /&gt;
Without an answer to these questions, even a temporary return to traditional mail is one of the few currently available ways out.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Blockchain Concept&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“Blockchain” is for sure the most prominent buzzword when talking Bitcoin. The blockchain data structure is important but remains just a single puzzle piece. Ironically, blockchain alone, which is a simple hashed linked list data structure, is not enough to reach effects like the often-quoted immutability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;At the core of Bitcoin’s resilience are &lt;STRONG&gt;four&lt;/STRONG&gt; key pillars: &lt;STRONG&gt;decentralization, blockchain&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;, cryptography, and proof-of-work&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Together they construct the emergent property of “data immutability”.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;EM&gt;Decentralization&lt;/EM&gt; removes one vulnerable single point of failure from a technical architectural perspective by spreading duplicated components around the world.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;EM&gt;Blockchain&lt;/EM&gt; chains data together and establishes a data relationship over time.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;EM&gt;Cryptography&lt;/EM&gt; entangles secret and public information to provide a form of “possession” in cyberspace.&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;EM&gt;Proof of work&lt;/EM&gt; binds information to physical effort and thereby to the physical world, forging a past with unfalsifiable costliness.&lt;BR /&gt;
As a result, this scarce information acquires several desirable physical properties without inheriting their drawbacks. Be aware that the Bitcoin blockchain can only enforce what’s inside its own network and therefore is powerless on what is happening outside the network.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bringing order back into the generative AI fake chaos by Blockchain&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400;overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/AI-The-non-monetary-use-cases-of-a-strong-Blockchain.png" /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;To restore a positive signal-to-noise ratio in cyberspace awash with digital assets, blockchain technology is coming into play to clear the field of vision for businesses. A strong blockchain, with its non-monetary use cases, can help combat the masses of inflationary, harmful, AI-generated digital assets. Time. Facts. Energy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Let’s get through each of them:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The three non-monetary use-cases of a strong blockchain&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There is time against generative AI flood&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400;overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/Generative-AI-Flood-Blockchain-Anchoring.png" /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400;overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Anchoring digital assets in a “timechain” solves the problem of “WHEN”. The result is a “minimum time stamp” with legal provability.&lt;BR /&gt;
When did something happen? There is a mathematical way to prove that, for example, this fake invoice is not from January last year as stated but is fake and from yesterday.&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/Generative-AI-Flood-A-kidnapper-shows-an-actual-newspaper-with-its-hostage-to-proof-that-a-hostage-is-still-alive.png" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P class="image_caption" style="text-align: center;font-style: italic"&gt;A kidnapper shows an actual newspaper with its hostage to proof that a hostage is still alive&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;We’ll use a simple analogy to illustrate: imagine a hostage situation and the task of the blackmailer is to prove that the scourge is still alive today. Showing a calendar with the scourge or a digital timestamp on a smartphone would not be credible and would not convince anyone that the evidence is from today, since these stamps can be created at will. In contrast, the front page of a newspaper is unpredictable and therefore must be current. Such evidence is credible. Everyone knows this intuitively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;The same concept applies to a blockchain block. It is not possible to predict the upcoming blocks and their content. A hijacker could also show a picture of the hostage holding a Bitcoin block picture to prove a minimum date, since it was impossible to predict just like the front page of today’s newspaper last week.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;For data integrity, the question is WHEN was the digital asset issued?&lt;BR /&gt;
WHEN has the digital asset been revoked?&lt;BR /&gt;
Anchoring a data fingerprint, also called a hash value, in a blockchain provides a “minimum timestamp” for a digital asset and thus increases data integrity. Similar to the front page of a newspaper.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;A perfectly AI-generated video message from a CEO to his investors that is presented as leaked footage from last year, but is in fact fake and doctored, can do great damage to a company’s reputation and integrity, depending on what messages are conveyed there.&lt;BR /&gt;
For AI-generated assets such as a video statement from a CEO or even a simple invoice, blockchain technology provides a way to distinguish between new digital assets from last week and an asset that definitely existed two years ago. This could be an important contract or even a simple document scan.&lt;BR /&gt;
A digital asset can be mathematically proven to be "at least" as old as a block.&lt;BR /&gt;
Legal disputes can be settled with court-proof evidence of AI-generated digital assets claiming to be older than they are. Fake video messages from key corporate stakeholders can be debunked easily with the help of a strong blockchain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There are facts against generative AI flood&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/Generative-AI-flood-facts.png" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;There is immutable neutral data, thanks to blockchain technology. The “what” anchored on a strong blockchain with hash trees helps companies maintain control over their cross-enterprise data when other players besides themselves are involved. The data itself must be stored on a strong blockchain. AI generated data which pretends to be genuine can be filtered. The “fingerprint” in the form of a hash is already quite sufficient; the file itself does not need to be disclosed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/Generative-AI-flood-Approved-Fact-by-Blockchain.png" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;When companies use a “neutral database” provided by a strong blockchain, they gain non-repudiation of their digital assets and the assets of their participating business partners. Original digital assets cannot be subsequently declared to be counterfeit AI-generated content.&lt;BR /&gt;
Version conflicts or revocation states are clear and no longer a subject of debate and dispute;especially from a legal point of view.&lt;BR /&gt;
Maliciously generated AI assets that target cross-company shared digital assets no longer have a chance of being manipulated. The document, contract, or video message can be unambiguously verified to be in its original state with the swipe of a finger.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Even if the private keys corresponding to the identity in cyberspace are compromised, misuse would be quickly detected because all transactions involve a minimum level of visibility to the owners of the organization’s cryptographic keys. Hidden offline signatures are not possible when built on a strong public blockchain.&lt;BR /&gt;
Third-party proofs as governments for sustainability taxonomies are implanted in a strong form with minimal effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There is energy against generative AI flood&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;In cyberspace, one law seems to have been suspended: the law of physical costs. Emails and PDF certificates can seemingly be created at will and at almost zero cost. While there are indeed hardware and electricity costs associated with the creation and distribution of digital data, when we look at our email inbox, we intuitively know that the physical overhead in the real world is enormous when we operate in cyberspace. Any owner of a simple Internet device can send thousands of e-mails a day, disguising them as important corporate messages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400;overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/Generative-AI-Flood-Pentagon-Hack.png" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;13 minutes after the start of the Pentagon’s Whitehat hacking event in the form of the Bug Bounty program, the first report of a security breach arrived.&lt;BR /&gt;
If the test had required physically penetrating the Pentagon’s sensitive areas, these tests would undoubtedly have gone off without a hitch.&lt;BR /&gt;
In cyberspace, physical blockchains can revive real-world efforts to penetrate sensitive areas such as corporate networks.&lt;BR /&gt;
The internet error code ERROR 402 - PAYMENT REQUIRED is all but forgotten and no longer used – &amp;nbsp;until now. The coming flood of AI-generated content will change that.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;In the physical world, we can be sure that we will not receive 1,000 perfectly faked letters per day. The reason is the implied physical cost, so the attacker will run out of money very soon.&lt;BR /&gt;
So, if our physical mailbox gets spammed less than our email inbox, and the reason is simply that the actual cost of printing documents, buying a stamp, and mailing them deters the attackers, then we can copy those principles in cyberspace to meet the digital needs of our customers in an AI-saturated environment. This is already possible because we have energy-related assets that we can connect to enterprise digital assets. And malicious AI-generated content would have to do the same.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;&lt;IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/11/Generative-AI-Flood-Energy.png" /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;If we assume that the noise of AI-generated malicious content, like thousands of real responsive invoices per day, is disrupting and massively damaging the business operations of enterprises and causing them enormous potential harm, there is a reason to bring back the signal in the noise with a strong blockchain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;An interesting new concept in this area is the “Proof of Energy”. The basic idea is to give digital assets, such as sending an email or creating a contract, a certain “weight” in the form of energy.&lt;BR /&gt;
Bitcoin provides exactly that through Proof-of-Work:&lt;BR /&gt;
Attaching something of value to digital assets for inter-company communication, such as a few satoshis, which are the smallest unit of bitcoin (1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 sats), would signal, like a timestamp, that inter-company communication has actual costs and is worth listening to. These satoshis themselves represent a certain amount of energy as they are obtained through Proof-of-Work. But in Cyberspace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;“I have something to say to you, and here’s my proof of why this is worth doing for me.” As simple as a physical letter. To me, it’s worth X amount of effort to talk to you. But it gets even better than in the physical counterpart, because the enclosed satoshis, which by their nature are created with real physical activities like a proof of work, can be used as a deposit or pledge. So, companies can also return the attached currency when they confirm value-based communication. Harmful communications are denied this.&lt;BR /&gt;
In this way, companies can recover signal in a generative, AI-infested business environment where it is nearly impossible to distinguish between real and fake.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;Reduction of spam: It would become more expensive for spammers to send bulk emails which are weighted as important, as they would have to pay for each energized email. This could help to reduce the amount of spam noise.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;Prioritizing digital assets: Emails with a higher amount of satoshis attached could be considered more important and would be more likely to be read. Comparable to a rea-world letter.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
 	&lt;LI&gt;Appreciation of the recipient's time: A small amount of satoshis could serve as a thank you for the recipient's time &amp;amp; attention.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;The same concept could be applied to every other type of corporate cross-company communications, such as contracts, invoices or documents. Attaching energy could help ensure the authenticity of these digital assets and protect them from tampering by AI LLMs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Of course, there are also challenges and potential drawbacks with this energy approach. For one, it would require some technical complexity, both on the part of the sender and the recipient. Not all companies or employees are familiar with these concepts like energy on digital assets.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) is the best foundation to offer a standardized service as a solution for customers to “energize” their digital assets to be shared with other stakeholders, companies or third parties.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;Proof-of-Energy offers an interesting approach to address the challenges posed by AI-generated material and the general inundation of digital information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P style="font-weight: 400"&gt;So, giving digital assets a physical weighting to stand out against AI-generated noise. A digital asset sharing service could automatically attach cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to the company’s digital assets to be shared with the weight it deserves – “it’s worth listening to what I have to say. And I prove it with the use of real-world resources”.&lt;BR /&gt;
There is a huge cost to an attacker required from using generative AI and LLMs in a harmful way against businesses if those are protected with real-world resources.&lt;BR /&gt;
As we’ll see, it is possible to protect corporate communications, even if the misuse of generative AI is used by criminals to harm company businesses. A dystopian prospect for sure, but one to think about and have solutions for.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
