    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello and welcome to the blog post for Data Migration for Cash and Liquidity Management. In this post, we’ll cover essential guidance and highlight key considerations to keep in mind before migrating your Cash Management data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. The decision.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before you decide to take on migration, there are two questions that need to be answered.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do you need Cash and Liquidity Management ?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If the answer to above question is yes, then you need Cash Position or Liquidity analysis or both ?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we are assuming that you are migrating to OP 2021 or to a higher OP version. From OP 2021, there is a new way of dealing with cash management data, where cash position flows and liquidity analysis flows are handled separately.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second question is important from an operational point of view, as Liquidity analysis takes a bit of time since the flow builder plus executes with 9 steps of chain tracing. Cash Position is relatively quicker in execution time, and if you don‘t require liquidity analysis, then you need not spend memory resources for liquidity analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Before Migration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; a.&lt;/STRONG&gt; If you are using S/4 Hana, and an earlier OP version, you would be using Flow Builder 1.0 program for Cash Management. You need to ensure that the entries in FCLM_BSEG_DELTA and FCLM_MM_DELTA are processed as they come. If there are huge number of records in the above table, then you can take one out of the following three approaches.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can process all the entries stuck in the delta table, by executing the flow builder 1.0 program for running type &lt;STRONG&gt;Delta Run Based on Queue Table&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and with Max Steps of Chain Clearing = 4. This will take some time, if you have more than a hundred thousand entries. The four steps of chain clearing, also known as liquidity analysis, will take more time for execution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can process all the entries stuck in the delta table, by executing the flow builder 1.0 program for running type &lt;STRONG&gt;Delta Run Based on Queue Table&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and with Max Steps of Chain Clearing = 0 (Cash Position). This will take less time, due to 0 chain steps, and it will keep the cash management updated enough for the migration to go through.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can delete all the entries from the delta table by writing a Z* program, and then deactivate source applications temporarily. After migration, you can again activate the source applications and execute the flow builder plus manually in mass run mode, so that cash management is reinstated again. This option is only useful if your business can handle deactivation of cash flow reports till the data is migrated.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;b.&lt;/STRONG&gt; If you are in ECC system, then kindly go through the below notes. The below notes should give you a brief idea about the new tables/ transactions that are being used.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0002270400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;0002270400&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; - S4TWL - Cash Management – General&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0002726878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;0002726878&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;- &lt;STRONG&gt;S4TWL - Obsolete Transaction Codes and Programs in Cash and Liquidity Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can read more about flow builder plus in the KBA &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0003520602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;0003520602&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; - &lt;STRONG&gt;Flow Builder Plus: General Consulting Queries&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It’s important to understand, in S/4 Hana, that all cash management data is populated into table FQM_FLOW, also known as One Exposure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Complete the cash management configuration in the new system, by referring Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0003111810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;0003111810&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;. If you are only interested in Cash Position, then maintain as such in the source application accounting. Also ensure that the workflow is enabled for automatic execution of cash position into FQM_FLOW. If you are interested in Liquidity Analysis, or both, then setup the jobs and do the configuration as mentioned in the above note.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;After migration/ Cutover activity.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;a.&lt;/STRONG&gt; If you are migrating from an earlier version of S/4 Hana to a newer version, FCLM_FI_STAGING gets all the data dump from all the cash relevant documents present in BSEG table. The configuration that you have defined will populate the data into FQM_FLOW. However, you may face memory issues, if you have data in millions, all of which are getting executed in one go by flow builder.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you have more than couple of million entries in the staging table, the best course would be to just stop the event linkage DELTA_RUN_REC, and also the background jobs for liquidity analysis. You can pick a time when the system is not overwhelmed with various jobs, and can schedule the delta run for cash position and liquidity analysis, manually. Again, this option is to be only used if business can handle without cash flow reports for a while.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can also execute delta run for cash position manually every couple of hours. The execution of cash position does not take much time, and it might help business with the relevant reports. However, liquidity analysis will take time and you should execute the same when the system is bit free.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; b.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;If you are migrating from ECC system, documents will start coming to FCLM_FI_STAGING, once the data starts migrating to BSEG table. You can follow the above points here as well. The only difference, here, would be that data will come gradually to FCLM_FI_STAGING and not at a time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can reinstate the cash position’s event linkage DELTA_RUN_REC and the liquidity analysis‘ event based background job, once the entries in the staging table are in control. Its worthwhile to note that you may face higher CPU and DB load after the migration, for which its important to be prepared. You can do the mock migration in UAT phase, in order to have an idea about system performance and the number of entries you would actually be migrating during the cutover.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;What happens if there are huge amount of data left in FCLM_BSEG_DELTA ?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is discussed in KBA&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0003566758" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;0003566758&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, which you can refer. You may not be able to work with normal FI/MM transactions, as the system will try to transfer all the delta records to staging table. In this case, you need to write a Z* program to delete the delta entries and execute mass runs in flow builder plus for all company codes relevant to cash management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;(Note: If cash management is activated, FI/MM documents are created and then populated in the staging table. If there are records in the delta table, the system will move those to staging table as well).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;In OP 2021,&amp;nbsp; after switching from Flow Builder 1.0 to Flow Builder plus, old flows are not categorized separately as Liquidity/Cash position flows.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After migration from flow builder 1.0 to flow builder plus, the flows from flow builder 1.0 (with owner GCC) are termed as 'Shared flows' meaning that they can be used both as Cash Position and Liquidity Analysis flows. If you have opted for 'Cash Position and Liquidity Analysis', then the flows that will get created from the flow builder plus will have owners GCC and POS. The flows created by the old flow builder program with owner GCC can be left as it is, as those flows represent both cash position and liquidity analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;How to migrate flows from other source application areas, such as TRM, PAYRQ, etc.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For source applications other than FI and MM, you need to use FQM_INITIALIZE transaction. After the data is migrated for sales orders, payment requests, treasury deals, etc. and then execute FQM_INITIALZE for the company codes. FQM_INITIALIZE is relevant for below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CML(Customer and Mortgage Loans) &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/ac319d8fa4ea4624b40a58d23e3c4627/db683a57a0b3df72e10000000a44147b.html?state=TEST&amp;amp;version=2021.latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Consumer and Mortgage Loans in One Exposure from Operations | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;PAYRQ (Payment Request)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;FICA(Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable) &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/ac319d8fa4ea4624b40a58d23e3c4627/573ee5f7021f4f6ee10000000a42189c.html?state=TEST&amp;amp;version=2021.latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable (FI-CA) in One Exposure | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;REFX (Lease and Contract Management)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SDCM(Sales and Distribution)&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/ac319d8fa4ea4624b40a58d23e3c4627/b57e3b57bd2b3b70e10000000a44147b.html?state=TEST&amp;amp;version=2021.latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sales and Distribution in One Exposure from Operations | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;TRM (Treasury and Risk Management)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Old data coming to FQM_FLOW&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data that is present in BSEG table, if cash relevant, will come to FQM_FLOW. This has been discussed in KBA &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0003604654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;0003604654&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;. If you do not want flows prior to a certain date in FQM_FLOW, you can implement your own logic in BADI 'BADI_FQM_FLOW_ADJUST_CORE'.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In OP 2023, you can configure a start date in 'Define Start Date for One Exposure' configuration, after which ACTUAL flows prior to that date will not flow to FQM_FLOW. The configuration can be found in the below path:&lt;BR /&gt;SPRO--&amp;gt;SAP Reference IMG--&amp;gt; SAP Customizing Implementation Guide--&amp;gt; Financial Supply Chain Management--&amp;gt; Cash and Liquidity Management--&amp;gt; Cash Management--&amp;gt; Data Setup--&amp;gt; Define Start Date for One Exposure&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;Customizations in the upgraded system.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The customization logic previously implemented in the CALL_HADI method of the loading classes in the legacy S/4HANA system for Flow Builder 1.0 needs to be re-written and re-implemented in the new system within the BADI ‘BADI_FQM_FLOW_ADJUST_CORE’.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9.&amp;nbsp;Data Transfer between ECC and S/4 Hana and between other systems.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can refer to &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/ac319d8fa4ea4624b40a58d23e3c4627/1de97ed6b94448f7ae846eaa25b0a7ac.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Integration with Remote Systems&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; to understand the configurations and proxy settings to be done for transfer of data from ECC to S/4 Hana.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go through the Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0003345963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;0003345963&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;, to transfer One Exposure Cash Flow from your&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;On-Prem&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;system to other&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go through the&amp;nbsp;Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/0003345981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;0003345981&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;, to&amp;nbsp;transfer One Exposure Cash Flow from your&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;system to other&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;10.&amp;nbsp;If Cash management is not required.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can deactivate cash management, by deactivating the source applications, and then delete the data present in the staging tables and FQM_FLOW table by writing a Z* custom program. Cash Management can be late re-activated by activating the source applications and then execute the flow builder plus in mass run mode, to update Cash Management data in One Exposure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In conclusion, cash and liquidity management is a very adaptable product and can be deactivated and re-activated anytime. The flows can be rebuilt anytime, once the systems are stable. This would not have any implications, and there is no fear of data loss or duplication. I hope this blog helps you achieve a smooth migration and prepares you from any issues that may happen.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Organizational Structure - SAP S/4 Hana Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;In order to understand the organogram of any organization, it is essential to learn the functions of every org unit. Just like in a family, some people play the roles of guardians, supervisors and some are only dependents on elder, likewise SAP org units are.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Every organization utilizes its resources to earn profits so from where can we extract the profitability reports? It means there is a unit made responsible to collect information, analyse and report it in every manner that is &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;"CO-PA". (Controlling- Profitability Segment)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;. So, &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Operating Concern &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;is&amp;nbsp;like a super power who sits on the top of the org structure and have all the information. In SAP Public Cloud one operating concern is predefined with name of &lt;STRONG&gt;A000 &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;therefore CO Consultant do not need to create any other.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;It is assigned to controlling area, where all variable and fixed costs of the company is stored. Just like there cannot remain two swords in one sheath, similarly two controlling areas cannot be created.&amp;nbsp;In SAP Public Cloud one controlling area is predefined with name of &lt;STRONG&gt;A000 &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;therefore CO Consultant do not need to create any other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;The world of Finance begin when companies start trading, hence just like we have multiple universes, multiple company codes are assigned to controlling areas. &lt;STRONG&gt;Company code&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the smallest org structure in FI that stores all financial documents line items. It becomes a base for MM and SD structure, an independent family member upon which other gets dependent. Company codes nomenclature can be alpha-numeric. &lt;U&gt;FI Consultant will begin the org structure creation activity in SAP Public Cloud.&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lets take one scenario as an example. lets say a group of companies will be made as a company and its subsidiaries will be configured as separate company codes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Plant is the area which is responsible to record every production activity. What is happening inside a plant, cannot be known to that person who is sitting on the head of the family chair on the dining table. (CO-PA). Therefore, MM Consultant configures the alphanumeric plants to the company codes and with this relation, correct information passes to controlling area and reports of profit gets extracted. Profit is made of Revenue-Costs, so costs are available with controlling area, but what about revenue?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;So we have another stream, another module i,e SD who is solely responsible to dispatch and record sales. Then like a river, it flows into the sea of Finance and gets connected to CO-PA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;MM and SD are two extreme opposite sides, SD is a plus and MM is minus. (Inflows and outflows) MM has its own purchasing org, that can either be centralized or decentralized as per company's policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Similarly, SD has its own sales org,&amp;nbsp; SD consultant can assign one on multiple company codes or create a decentralized structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;In connection to controlling area. CO consultant designs a hierarchy of cost centers and profit centers to record their activities. Purchases can be found in multiple cost centers, and via report it can be plan to control it. Whereas, sales can be assigned profitability segments to know their contributions in profit figures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Under plant, multiple storage locations for inventory can be configured and assigned and under the same plant, sales area is made. Sales area is the combination of sales org, divisions and distribution channel. The longest activity in org structure is of SD module.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;The material is either procured externally or produced in-house, it moves from plant to warehouse, then stamped in sales office, it dispatches from shipping points to final consumer and consumer happily transfers the receipt in company's bank account. That's how production is materialized into finance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Please note no consultant can begin configuration without completing the organisational structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;It can be edited and recreated later on. but it will lock your workspace for sometime. After doing changes, confirm the units and deploy it onto your configuration server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Reports are formulated with the help of transactions, if a purchase order is made in MM, check the org units, (plant, purchasing org and storage location)&amp;nbsp; will be filled, so automatically it will be assigned to its respective company code and would reach CO-PA. SD will also follow the same in its preliminary financial documents. Hence, create a strong structure to uphold the data in correct formats and form.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Till now, we have &lt;STRONG&gt;CO-FI-MM and SD&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the picture and that's how organisational structure is framed in SAP S/4 Hana Public Cloud. The role of CO is predefined, in Grey cannot be changed in any circumstances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;To state the obvious: Getting your taxes right is an important part of your business, and it’s not an area where you’d typically seek out additional complexities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the shortest possible version of why it’s difficult to change your sales and use tax procedure in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. Your tax procedure is something you set up in your initial scoping, and it is in most cases the deepest asleep of all of your sleeping dogs. Almost all the time, you just want to leave it alone.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Almost. There &lt;EM&gt;are&lt;/EM&gt; times when you need to make a change. Perhaps your business structure has changed sufficiently that you want to move from the internal tax calculation procedure to the external and join up with a tax partner. Or maybe you need to switch tax partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In these cases, with live systems, you need to think carefully, plan for disruption, think again, and plan some more. And then probably do that one more time. Then if you’re going ahead, consult our KBA entitled&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3636110/E" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Information on the Internal Tax Calculation Procedure (TAXUSJ) to the External Tax Calculation Procedure (0TXUSX)&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for more detailed information on the procedure, risks, and potential downtimes associated with such a switch.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;It’s common to hear colleagues from other S4Hana modules express frustration with the complexity and impact of FI/CO on their processes. However, this perception often stems from a fundamental misunderstanding: the organizational structure of SAP S/4HANA Finance is not merely technical; it is the practical embodiment of the accounting principles that govern the financial governance of any organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every object, from Company Code to Segment, is meticulously designed to ensure that financial records adhere to the pillars of accounting—promoting integrity, transparency, and, crucially, supporting strategic decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This article explores the intrinsic relationship between accounting principles and organizational objects in SAP S/4HANA FI, demystifying why their influence is so broad and vital to a company’s financial health. Get ready for an analysis that goes beyond technical configuration, diving into the accounting logic behind each system structure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’ve broken the concepts into levels to make them easier to understand.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1737925313"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1541411808"&gt;Level 1: The Legal Entity and Going Concern in SAP S/4HANA&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The starting point of any robust accounting system lies in properly defining the entity and in the premise of its uninterrupted operation. In SAP S/4HANA, these concepts are solidly embedded in its foundational organizational objects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1473981022"&gt;Entity Principle: The Company Code as the Legal Unit&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Entity Principle is one of the pillars of accounting, establishing that a company’s assets are distinct from those of its owners or shareholders. Accounting is therefore maintained for the business entity as an economically and legally separate unit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Company Code&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the most direct and crucial representation of this principle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Company Code is the smallest organizational unit for which a complete and self-contained set of accounts can be created, enabling the generation of external financial statements such as Balance Sheets and Income Statements, as required by law. Configuring a Company Code in SAP is, in fact, defining the legal and asset boundaries that the Entity Principle demands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All financial transactions—whether purchases, sales, or payments—are recorded within a specific Company Code, ensuring segregation and clarity of each legal entity’s finances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="1.jpg" style="width: 428px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303540iB1414A4D5BF39CAA/image-dimensions/428x428?v=v2" width="428" height="428" role="button" title="1.jpg" alt="1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Going Concern Principle: The Long-Term Assumption in FI-AA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Going Concern Principle assumes that the entity will continue operating indefinitely, with no intent of liquidation or significant downsizing. This is fundamental for classifying assets and liabilities (current vs. non-current) and, notably, for depreciating assets over their useful lives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the long-term existence of the Company Code, together with specific modules like Fixed Assets (FI-AA), reflects this principle directly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;FI-AA, configured per Company Code, manages asset depreciation across multiple years—a process that only makes sense under the assumption of continued operations. The system is inherently designed to handle the full lifecycle of assets and liabilities, which is a direct and systemic application of the Going Concern Principle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1148384798"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-951871293"&gt;Level 2: Measurement and Recording of Activities – The Basis of Accounting in S/4HANA&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the entity is established, the next step is ensuring all financial activities are measured and recorded consistently and accurately. SAP S/4HANA provides robust tools aligned with essential accounting principles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-884440507"&gt;Monetary Unit Principle: Currency and Chart of Accounts&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Monetary Unit Principle requires all transactions and economic events to be expressed in a single currency. This enables aggregation, comparison, and consistent analysis of financial data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, this principle is realized through the &lt;STRONG&gt;Company Code Currency&lt;/STRONG&gt; and the &lt;STRONG&gt;Chart of Accounts&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each Company Code is configured with a local currency (e.g., BRL, USD), in which all legal reports are generated. Regardless of the original transaction currency, amounts are converted and recorded in this common denominator. The Chart of Accounts, assigned to the Company Code, provides the structured hierarchy for recording economic events in an organized and standardized manner, allocating monetary values to categories such as Assets, Liabilities, Revenue, and Expenses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2.jpg" style="width: 379px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303541i965C7B87AF34579A/image-dimensions/379x379?v=v2" width="379" height="379" role="button" title="2.jpg" alt="2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accrual and Matching Principles: The Universal Journal as the Core of Recording&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Accrual and Matching Principles are critical for accurate income determination.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accrual Principle&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Revenues and expenses must be recognized in the period in which they are generated, regardless of cash flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Matching Principle&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Revenues must be matched with the expenses that contributed to generating them, preventing distortions in the Income Statement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP S/4HANA fundamentally operates on an accrual basis. &lt;STRONG&gt;Fiscal Year Variants&lt;/STRONG&gt; structure periods (usually monthly) and control postings, ensuring that an August sales invoice is recorded in August, even if payment occurs in September.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Universal Journal (ACDOCA table)&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the “single source of truth.” Every posting of revenue or expense is registered with both posting and document dates, ensuring proper period recognition. By unifying FI and CO data, the Universal Journal enables direct matching of revenues with their related costs—all in one place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Native integration across SD (Sales &amp;amp; Distribution), MM (Materials Management), and FI automates matching. For instance, a goods issue in SD automatically triggers inventory reduction in MM and simultaneously records both Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and revenue in FI. Likewise, FI-AA automatically posts depreciation monthly, while Cost Centers in CO record operating expenses that can be matched against generated results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-558844283"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="3.jpg" style="width: 409px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303542iC09735CC0A5557FD/image-dimensions/409x409?v=v2" width="409" height="409" role="button" title="3.jpg" alt="3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-362330778"&gt;Level 3: Managerial Analysis and Reporting – Beyond Statutory Accounting&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond legal requirements, managers need granular insight into business performance. SAP S/4HANA applies accounting principles at an internal level to provide valuable managerial insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-294899992"&gt;Segment Reporting (IFRS 8): The Segment Object&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;IFRS 8 (CPC 22 in Brazil) requires publicly traded companies to disclose information about their operating segments, enabling investors to analyze the business as management does.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Segment&lt;/STRONG&gt; object is specifically designed for this. Derived at posting (often from Profit Centers), it enables real-time balance sheets and income statements per segment via the Universal Journal, providing unprecedented transparency into performance across business lines or geographies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="4.jpg" style="width: 265px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303528iEE83D45747FCAF63/image-dimensions/265x265?v=v2" width="265" height="265" role="button" title="4.jpg" alt="4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-98386487"&gt;Internal Matching Principle: Profit Center and Cost Center&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;For managerial performance evaluation, revenues must be matched with the costs incurred to generate them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Profit Center&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Represents a unit accountable for its own P&amp;amp;L, capturing revenues and expenses. It applies the matching principle internally, enabling profitability analysis of products, branches, or divisions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost Center&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Represents where costs are incurred (e.g., HR, IT), without directly generating revenue. Costs are controlled here and can later be allocated to Profit Centers for full profitability analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Together, Profit and Cost Centers close the cycle of internal matching.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="5.jpg" style="width: 373px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303529iE7E86DF212110A4E/image-dimensions/373x373?v=v2" width="373" height="373" role="button" title="5.jpg" alt="5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prudence (Conservatism) Principle: Credit Control Area&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Prudence Principle dictates that, when in doubt, record the least favorable outcome—lower assets/revenues and higher liabilities/expenses. In practice, this means caution and recognition of probable losses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Credit Control Area&lt;/STRONG&gt; embodies this principle. By setting credit limits and monitoring exposures, it helps manage default risk. Functionality like provisions for doubtful accounts (bad debt allowances) within FI applies prudence directly, recognizing probable expenses before losses materialize.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="6.png" style="width: 377px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303530i50E278EE7D4B2FC6/image-dimensions/377x377?v=v2" width="377" height="377" role="button" title="6.png" alt="6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Level 4: Information Quality and Systemic Governance in S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Building an accounting structure is just step one. The next, equally critical, is ensuring that the information flowing through it is reliable, consistent, and accurate. SAP S/4HANA achieves this via its integrated architecture and intrinsic controls—systemic embodiments of governance and data quality principles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--173358387"&gt;Consistency Principle: Operational Chart of Accounts and Posting Models&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Consistency Principle requires that companies apply the same accounting practices across periods, allowing comparability over time. Changes are allowed only if preferable and properly disclosed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Operational Chart of Accounts&lt;/STRONG&gt;—once defined—becomes the backbone of all postings. Using a single chart across a group ensures uniform treatment of similar transactions across entities. Posting Models and Screen Variants enforce standardized postings for recurring transactions, reinforcing consistency and reducing manual errors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--369871892"&gt;Integrity, Completeness, and Synchronization of Data: Universal Journal and Native Integration&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data governance principles—Integrity, Completeness, Synchronization—are fundamental to information reliability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integrity&lt;/STRONG&gt; ensures accuracy and trustworthiness.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Completeness&lt;/STRONG&gt; ensures all required data is captured.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Synchronization&lt;/STRONG&gt; ensures consistency across accounting, managerial, and logistics views.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Universal Journal&lt;/STRONG&gt; achieves this by merging FI, CO, FI-AA, CO-PA, and ML into a single line-item repository. This eliminates complex reconciliations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Native integration ensures that when goods movement is posted in MM, the corresponding FI entry is simultaneously generated. No batch transfers that can fail; if one part fails, the transaction is reversed entirely, ensuring integrity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Universal Journal structure, containing all relevant fields (company, account, cost center, profit center, segment, etc.) in one table, ensures completeness. Its “single source of truth” architecture means all views—statutory and managerial—are instantly updated, eliminating reconciliations that plagued earlier SAP versions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="7.jpg" style="width: 362px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303531i6E51FD0650E89A8A/image-dimensions/362x362?v=v2" width="362" height="362" role="button" title="7.jpg" alt="7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion: SAP S/4HANA as an Enabler of Accounting Governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Understanding the deep connection between accounting principles and SAP S/4HANA FI architecture is crucial for every consultant. Far from being just a transactional system, S/4HANA is a platform that &lt;STRONG&gt;incorporates and automates accounting principles&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensuring not only legal compliance but also real-time financial insights for strategic decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By mastering this synergy, consultants can go beyond technical configuration and act as true business partners—optimizing processes, safeguarding data integrity, and maximizing the value SAP S/4HANA delivers to financial governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The evolution of ERP into S/4HANA represents a qualitative leap in how companies manage their finances—transforming accounting principles into operational and strategic reality.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Plant maintenance integrates with many of the modules and below are the some of the modules that plant maintenance integrates with:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FICO(Finance and controlling) :-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below are the integration points of plant maintenance with FICO.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Company Code: -&lt;/STRONG&gt; A plant will always be assigned to the company code.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost center: -&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Cost Center is an organizational unit within a controlling area that is used to collect and record costs incurred from business activities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Investment order: -&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; investment order needs cost budgeting for an order will be done.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Allocation Structure: -&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; In the allocation structure the cost elements will be taken from the CO in which these cost elements will gets reflected is any maintenance order have consumption of materials, Labour cost, 3rd party material procurement etc... which will flow the costs to the FI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Asset master creation: -&lt;/STRONG&gt; When an equipment is being created then the asset will be created with a configuration.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Settlement Of an Order: -&lt;/STRONG&gt; The settlement of an order is actually being done for an order because at the cost needs to be settled.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Settlement Profile: -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The settlement profile will be assigned to the order type.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Activity Type: - &lt;/STRONG&gt;In&amp;nbsp;activity type the price or the cost for labour per hour will be determined by FICO consultant and we need to maintain the activity type in the work center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;PP(Production Planning) :-&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Work Center: -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In work center the capacity will be determined by the production planning team. Here the capacity refers to the availability of people and resources for maintenance work.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Equipment Master Data: -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In equipment master data there is a field work center in the Location in which we need to give the production planning work center and whereas in the organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Spare Part Preparation: -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;For example the spare part cannot be procured externally then the spare part will be produced by the production order and the settlement rule of order will be done to the maintenance order.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Refurbishment of Material:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Refurbishment of material will be done if any material in production needs to be repaired as soon as possible then we will just refurbish the material and replace the material within the machine as it was there before the breakdown.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MM(Material Management):-&lt;BR /&gt;Components:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The components that are required for maintenance of machine will be taken from the inventory.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Service Entry Sheet:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;To procure the service from external that is the maintenance has to be done for a machine and there is no team that is present in the plant(internal team) then we will just raise purchase requestion from the maintenance order and after it the material management people will procure the service through ML81N."&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Split valuation:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Split valuation for a material has to be configured so that we can perform the refurbishment order.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Details of plant:-&lt;/STRONG&gt; The details of plant related namely Purchase Organization, Vendor, Supplier, Outline agreement number etc..&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Serial Number Profile:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A serial number profile must be configured for the material to enable the creation of equipment for that material.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Goods Issue:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Goods issue needs to be done for the order otherwise the technician cannot perform the maintenance activities that are present in the order.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Goods Receipt:-&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Goods receipt has to be done for the Internal Refurbishment Order and the settlement will be done for the material.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Material Reservation:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;after creating the maintenance order the materials will be reserved in the inventory automatically.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Procurement:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Procuring of non-stock material, service entry sheet through purchase requestion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quality Management:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;CatLog Profile:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Catlog profile will be configured by the quality management team and it will be assigned for the equipment , functional location.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Calibration Order:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In calibration order inspection will be done and thereby the equipment can be used or not will be determined by the quality management team.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SD(Sales And Distribution):-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The place where the sales and distribution as well as plant maintenance will gets integrated is in customer service module.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;EHS(Environment Health &amp;amp; Safety):-&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The integration part of PM with EHS comes only at the product safety, Work permit - while performing any maintenance at the dangerous or hazardous material or equipment's.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FREM(Flexible Real Estate Management):-&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Flexible real estate management and plant maintenance both comes under Enterprise Asset Management in SAP S/4 Hana.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Real Estate Object: -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Real estate object will be considered as functional location/equipment.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Work order:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Notification and work order management à&amp;nbsp;maintenance requests originating from RE-FX can be turned into PM notifications/ orders but this will be done with the help of CRM.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Service Provider Coordination: -&lt;/STRONG&gt; PM order can trigger external services with the help of MM (material management) to work on RE-FX managed asset.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HCM(Human Capital Management):-&lt;BR /&gt;Person Responsible:-&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Here the person can be assigned to the work order , work center, Technical Object, Operations in work order too.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;DMS(Document Management System):-&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Documents can be uploaded for the technical objects, notifications , work orders etc... for information or to follow the rules to keep the equipment runs smoothly.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The above are some of the modules for which the plant maintenance will integrate with.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Hope its informative and feel free to comment for any improvements or suggestions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;BR /&gt;Neeraj.&amp;nbsp;

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1343831468" id="toc-hId-1888190302"&gt;The world is in sprint mode ...&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;.... AI cycles flip every quarter, supply chains get bendy, climate shocks rewrite plans. As Lenin put it, "there are weeks when decades happen." Winning 2030 isn’t about hoarding data or demo sparkle. It’s about &lt;STRONG&gt;cutting friction&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;staying focused&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;moving as one&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP’s 2030 play:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI that removes grind -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;copilots, automation, anomaly detection.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data you can trust -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;clean, connected, decision-ready.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Networks that sync the ecosystem -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;suppliers, partners, customers moving together&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The metaphor? &lt;STRONG&gt;Lock laces.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Triathletes don’t stop to tie shoes. They slip on and go. In finance, AI is the lock lace: auto-recs, instant cleanup, fewer errors. Hours back. Focus up.

    <content>&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP offers various functionalities to manage attachments, but the mass download of invoice attachments is not a standard, out-of-the-box feature. This is a common pain point for many SAP users, especially in Accounts Payable departments, who need to archive or audit a large volume of invoices with their corresponding attachments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post, we will explore the different ways to achieve this, from standard transactions to custom solutions, providing a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to streamline this process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1889024421"&gt;&lt;U&gt;The Challenge of Mass Attachment Download in SAP&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard SAP transactions like FB03 (Display Document) or MIR4 (Display Invoice Document) allow you to view attachments individually. However, they lack a function to download a large number of attachments at once. This becomes a significant bottleneck when:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Auditing:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You need to provide a complete set of invoices and attachments to internal or external auditors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Archiving:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You are migrating documents to an external content management system or preparing for a system shutdown.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reporting:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You need to extract a bulk of data with attachments for analytical purposes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, how can you tackle this challenge? Let's delve into the methods available.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1692510916"&gt;Method 1: The Manual, Item-by-Item Approach (Not Recommended for Mass)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This method is only feasible for a very small number of invoices and serves as a good starting point to understand where attachments are stored.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigate to the Invoice:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Use transaction FB03 (for FI documents) or MIR4 (for Logistics Invoice Verification).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Access the Services for Object icon:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is the small icon with a paperclip and a piece of paper, typically found in the top-left corner of the screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;View and Download:&lt;/STRONG&gt; From the dropdown menu, select Attachment list. A window will pop up showing all the attachments linked to that document. You can then select and download each one individually.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why this isn't a long-term solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This process is extremely time-consuming and prone to human error. It's simply not practical for mass downloads.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1495997411"&gt;Method 2: The Semi-Automated SO_OBJECT_DOWNLOAD Function Module&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For those with some technical know-how, this method provides a way to download attachments programmatically, but still on a document-by-document basis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Identify the Document Key:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Each attachment is linked to an object key in SAP. You can find this by navigating to SOBJ table or through the attachment list pop-up screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Execute SO_OBJECT_DOWNLOAD:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Go to transaction SE37 and execute the function module SO_OBJECT_DOWNLOAD.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Provide the Object Key:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In the function module parameters, input the object key of the attachment you want to download. You can then execute it to save the file to your local drive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Limitations:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This method is still not a true "mass" download solution. It requires you to know the object key for each attachment, which means you would need to write a custom program to get this data in the first place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1299483906"&gt;Method 3: The Custom ABAP Program (The Most Effective Solution)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the most common and robust solution for mass downloads. It requires the expertise of an ABAP developer but provides the flexibility to meet your specific business requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How a Custom Program Works:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A well-designed ABAP program for mass downloads would typically follow these steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Input Parameters:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The program should have a selection screen where the user can input a range of invoice document numbers, vendor numbers, posting dates, or other relevant criteria.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Retrieve Document List:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The program will read the relevant SAP tables (e.g., BKPF for document headers, RSEG for invoice documents) to get a list of all invoices that meet the selection criteria.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Link to Attachments:&lt;/STRONG&gt; For each invoice document found, the program will query the attachment tables. The primary tables for object links are SRGBTBREL (Relations between Business Objects) and SOFFCONT1 (the actual content of the documents).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Download and Save:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The program will then loop through each attachment found, retrieve its content from SOFFCONT1, and save it to a specified folder on the user's local machine or a network drive. The filename can be dynamically generated using the invoice number, vendor number, or other relevant data for easy identification.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Logging and Reporting:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The program should generate a log showing which documents were processed, which attachments were downloaded successfully, and which ones failed (e.g., if there was no attachment).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&amp;amp;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

For true mass downloads, a &lt;STRONG&gt;custom ABAP program is the most efficient and recommended solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It's a one-time development effort that can save significant time and effort in the long run, particularly for Accounts Payable teams, auditors, and IT administrators.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are facing this challenge, consider reaching out to your in-house ABAP team or an SAP consulting partner to develop a custom solution that fits your business needs perfectly.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2019004746"&gt;Join us for co-innovation&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;We would like to invite the public cloud customers joining us for the co-innovation of AI capability &lt;STRONG&gt;AI assisted Balance Validation Rule Creation,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;and if you are with valid FBA, please feel free to reply me in this blog, and we are looking forward meeting you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's shape the future together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1822491241"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Challenge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Organizations often face challenges such as a financial close process that struggles to reach peak performance, characterized by inefficiencies and delayed timelines. Additionally, governance and compliance requirements can become overly burdensome, consuming valuable time with extensive data collection and documentation efforts. Furthermore, there is frequently a lack of transparency and insight across system boundaries, which hampers decision-making and collaboration. Tackling these issues requires a strategic approach that involves process optimization, technology adoption, and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt; in financial management systems are designed to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and communication.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Managing validation rules and groups standardizes these processes, preventing financial misstatements and reducing audit and compliance risks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automated balance validation tasks accelerate the closing process and minimize manual efforts, freeing up valuable time for strategic activities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Real-time validation analytics provide immediate insights and maintain a comprehensive audit trail, ensuring transparency and accountability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The ability to add comments facilitates smooth communication between subsidiaries and headquarters, ensuring alignment and reducing misunderstandings. Together, these capabilities transform financial operations, driving reliability and efficiency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141114.png" style="width: 877px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316258i2D590B411E8CEE4B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141114.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141114.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Balance Validation plays a critical role in supporting &lt;STRONG&gt;Accounting&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Group Reporting&lt;/STRONG&gt;, especially when integrated with &lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced Financial Closing&lt;/STRONG&gt; processes. This function ensures that all accounts are accurately reconciled and validated, providing a strong foundation for precise financial reporting. By incorporating Balance Validation into the closing cycle, organizations can identify discrepancies early, reduce errors, and enhance the integrity of their financial statements. This integration not only accelerates the closing process but also strengthens group reporting by ensuring consistent and reliable data across all levels of the organization, thereby supporting compliance and informed strategic decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141226.png" style="width: 876px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316259iE319C17832A12784/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141226.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141226.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application of &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Balance Validation Rules and Groups&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides a centralized platform for defining and managing validation rules that prevent financial misstatements and mitigate compliance risks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141350.png" style="width: 822px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316260iDB3E639A0410F54B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141350.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141350.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141421.png" style="width: 810px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316261iF53DB8D0D86201FE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141421.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141421.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141503.png" style="width: 808px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316262iA59E3377A2CBD18A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141503.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141503.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application &lt;STRONG&gt;Scheduled Balance Validation Jobs&lt;/STRONG&gt; accelerates the financial closing cycle while significantly reducing manual workload by&amp;nbsp;automating balance validation tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141546.png" style="width: 817px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316263i2C8A5DFFD88642BE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141546.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141546.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;View Balance Validation Results&lt;/STRONG&gt; offers immediate insights and maintains an audit trail, ensuring transparency.

The AI then analyzes historical data and industry best practices to draft a proposed validation rule, incorporating common elements such as G/L account hierarchy nodes and function areas. This intelligent proposal streamlines the rule creation process, minimizing the need for specialized expertise. Users can subsequently review the draft, make necessary adjustments, and save or activate the rule, ensuring it aligns with organizational requirements and enhances the accuracy and efficiency of financial operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="image (4).png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316265i2FD35F15DB65D1B2/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="image (4).png" alt="image (4).png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="image (5).png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316266i5A6AFE815C48DCB5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="image (5).png" alt="image (5).png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is the help document about Balance Validation capability,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0fa84c9d9c634132b7c4abb9ffdd8f06/8c1fce9f709f482cb890bc440fbb79bd.html?version=2508.VAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Balance Validation | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Enterprises are rethinking how to connect banking capabilities with ERP processes to maximize business value. Key questions include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to make payments, reconciliation, and cash visibility seamless and fully integrated between banks and the ERP system?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to adopt innovations like real-time payments or real-time cash balances without launching a new IT project every time a banking service gets added?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to unlock the combined value of invoice and payment data in the ERP alongside the cash and financial data held by banks?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP and J.P. Morgan asked themselves the same questions. And as a result decided to collaborate and partner even closer to bring more value to shared clients by better integrating the capabilities of both by accelerating adoption of SAP Multi-Bank Connectivity (MBC) to deliver J.P.

    <title>Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion (UCFC)/CustOnTmp</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is CustOnTmp&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The downtime-optimized conversion (doC) executes the FIN data conversion on the temporary instance during the uptime. For this, SUM needs the FIN Customizing to apply it prior to the data conversion. Until now, this required a standard conversion run prior to each doC run. In this standard run, the FIN Customizing was created and added to a transport request. Such a transport request is required to be provided to each doC run.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the new feature Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion, FIN delta Customizing activities can be performed directly on the temporary instance of the doC run. With this, the number of required standard conversion runs is reduced to one standard conversion at the beginning of the project. All FIN delta Customizing activities can be directly done on the temporary instance of the doC run. For each new doC iteration, the initial FIN Customizing transport request is used (created in standard conversion) together with all the delta Customizing transport requests prepared with each new iteration.&amp;nbsp; It is no longer required to always run a standard conversion before each doC cycle&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Target release SAP S/4HANA&amp;nbsp;2022&amp;nbsp;(or higher)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;DOC with database migration (so no in place conversion; migration is possible also for source on SAP HANA)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SUM 2.0 SP 23 (or higher)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Differences Between Standard doC and Uptime Customizing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The uptime customizing will by default add most application tables to the uptime handling automatically. This means, the manual selection of tables for uptime migration becomes mostly obsolete. The SUM will no longer display the respective section on downtime-optimized DMO (with file specification "table list"). If there are still tables which cause a significant runtime during phase&amp;nbsp;EU_CLONE_MIG_DT_RUN they can still be added manually using CRRTABLIST.LST as in regular doC approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every application table in uptime handling gets either a replication trigger or a freeze trigger in the source system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The reasons for a freeze trigger are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customizing table with delivery class C, E or G&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Static classification in SUM which requires a read-only restriction&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Freeze Trigger&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Freeze triggers are needed to ensure the consistency of the uptime conversion. Freeze triggers are used in 3 different ways as below&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hard Freeze&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Freeze triggers are used to prevent customizing changes in the source system which might influence and invalidate the uptime conversion which is done in parallel to production on the temporary instance. This means that the number of freeze tables is significantly higher as in regular doC approach, although it should not add additional business restrictions as most of the freeze triggers are defined on pure customizing table which are not changed directly in a productive system. Nevertheless, the Impact analysis is of a higher importance for the doC with Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion&amp;nbsp;approach. The hard freeze will be activated during the preparation in phase SQLDB_FREEZE_TRIG_MODE_SWITCH_SMIG_TCR and will remain until the end of the doC procedure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please refer the&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;to SAP Note&amp;nbsp;2481983&amp;nbsp;- SUM Impact Analysis for downtime-optimized DMO&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Temporary Freeze&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some tables only be set read-only for a short period of time, for example while the Asset Accounting is prepared for the Uptime Conversion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Freeze on Temporary System&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;There will be freeze triggers used on the temporary instance between the SUM phases&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;RUN_SMIG_SFIN_CUST_ON_TEMP_FREEZE&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;RUN_SMIG_SFIN_CUST_ON_TEMP_FREEZE_REV&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As tables must only be changed either by production operation (business users on system) on source system or by the customizing activities on the temporary system, all tables which can be changed by production operation will be set to read-only on the temporary system to avoid conflicting changes. It is, therefore, possible that a Customizing activity on the temporary instance fails with a short dump. In this case, create an incident&amp;nbsp; on component BC-UPG-DTM-TLA to clarify the access.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some tables can be changed on source system and temporary system. Additionally, it is ensured that this does not cause a conflict or there is a special handling implementation like for number ranges.&amp;nbsp;For more information, refer to section&amp;nbsp;3.1 Number Ranges&amp;nbsp;in this SAP Note.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Execution&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During each doC execution, you&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;must&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;check in phase REQ_DOCMAX_DELTA_CUSTOMIZING&amp;nbsp;that the provided FIN customizing that was added via CTI buffer is still valid.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;doC with Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion&amp;nbsp;allows to add additional Customizing directly shortly before the uptime phase&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;PARRUN_SMIG_SFIN&lt;/EM&gt;. To do so, perform the following steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SUM will stop in dialog phase REQ_DOCMAX_DELTA_CUSTOMIZING.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Perform the IMG activities listed under "IMG/Conversion of Accounting to SAP S/4HANA / Preparations and Migration of Customizing" in each relevant client. Use transaction SPRO in the respective clients to perform the needed customizing steps.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;U&gt;Note&lt;/U&gt;: to identify if there are any delta customizing activities required, the customizing activities must be executed step by step (this information can't be provided by the tool).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Remark:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The Customizing activities must be strictly restricted to the required Finance conversion Customizing.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;3.&amp;nbsp; Start the uptime FIN conversion by continuing SUM&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Restricted tables for Uptime Handling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following tables must not be added manually to uptime using CRRTABLIST.LST to avoid potential issues during Delta Customizing for the S/4HANA Finance Conversion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;BALHDR, BALDAT and BAL_INDX&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customizing on the Temporary Instance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Preparation of Number Range “RF_BELEG” for New Document Type for Postings in Controlling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;When using the Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion&amp;nbsp;approach, the preparation of data migration requires a new document type for postings in Controlling that considers also a new number range object “RF_BELEG”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Available options for Number Range Number definition for controlling document type:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In target system(S/4HANA):After SFIN Data Migration completion, before releasing the system to business users (the recommended one)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;During S/4HANA&amp;nbsp;Standard&amp;nbsp;Customizing preparation with the inclusion into the FI customizing transport request of the CO number ranges numbers;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In source system (ECC): Before the start of S/4HANA technical activities&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Preparations and Migration of Customizing for Controlling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Maintain Operating Concern (KEA0)” on the temporary instance is not possible due to read-only restriction on table&amp;nbsp;TKES2 and&amp;nbsp;CEFORMT. Execute “Maintain Operating Concern”&amp;nbsp;only after SFIN delta migration is completed, as an after-migration activity, outside of SUM tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Restrictions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Depreciation calculation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Due to a read-only restriction on table T093D&amp;nbsp;it is not allowed to run depreciation calculation when triggers are active in the system.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Is SAP Joule?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Joule is SAP’s AI copilot embedded across its cloud applications. It offers four interaction types—&lt;STRONG&gt;Transactional&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigational&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Informational&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analytical&lt;/STRONG&gt;—that let users perform business tasks via natural language within SAP environments. It understands user context, roles, permissions, and remains secure by design. It can also ground responses in your own business documents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How SAP Joule works in Public vs. Private Cloud is one of the most important considerations for finance teams (especially in FICO) deciding on adoption.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here’s a structured view:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SAP Joule in Public vs. Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deployment &amp;amp; Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule is natively embedded and updated by SAP automatically.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration with SAP FICO apps (GL, AP, AR, Asset Accounting, Controlling) is out of the box.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No additional installation required - users just activate and configure.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule can be enabled, but may require additional setup and integration.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Some Joule features might lag behind public cloud, because public gets innovations first.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Still integrates with FICO, but might require extra configuration &amp;amp;

days.”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Action:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Lists overdue accounts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extension with Agent:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;An AI agent sends personalized payment reminders and schedules calls with collections staff.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Budget vs. Actual Control&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ask Joule:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“Which cost centers exceeded budget last quarter?”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Action:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Shows variances with drill-down.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extension with Agent:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Automatically notify budget owners when variances exceed a threshold (say 10%).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;How to Design in Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio (within SAP Build)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;you can:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create a Skill&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;→ “Generate quarterly P&amp;amp;L by company code and send PDF to finance team.”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create an Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;→ “Monitor overdue vendor payments and auto-initiate dunning.”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Connect Non-SAP Apps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;→ e.g., send approvals via MS Teams or Slack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This way, Joule moves from a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;copilot&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(answering queries) to a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;colleague&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(executing finance tasks for you).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deep Dive on one of the real-world example: Vendor Invoice Posting with SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;in&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public vs Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Example:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Vendor Invoice Posting with Joule&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Scenario&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A finance user wants to post a vendor invoice for&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Vendor 300012&lt;/STRONG&gt;, amount&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;$12,000&lt;/STRONG&gt;, due in 30 days.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Public Cloud (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User says to Joule:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“Post a vendor invoice of $12,000 for Vendor 300012, due in 30 days.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Process:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Understands the intent (“Create Vendor Invoice”).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pulls relevant master data (Vendor 300012 details, tax code, payment terms).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pre-fills the invoice screen in Fiori.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;User confirms → Invoice is posted.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extras in Public Cloud:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule can immediately display the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;document number&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;due date schedule&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If connected to SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC), Joule can also show how this impacts&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;cash outflow forecast&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Minimal setup → available out-of-the-box.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Private Cloud (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User says to Joule:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“Post a vendor invoice of $12,000 for Vendor 300012, due in 30 days.”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Process:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Provide navigation → “Open FB60 (Vendor Invoice Entry)” or “Fiori App: Create Supplier Invoice.”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pre-fill metadata only if integrated with custom Joule Skill via&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule recognizes intent, but instead of direct posting, it may:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;User manually confirms or adjusts in the classic posting screen (e.g., FB60 / MIRO).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Invoice is posted.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extras in Private Cloud:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;customize Joule Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(via Joule Studio + BTP) to enforce company-specific validations (e.g., block invoices &amp;gt;$10,000 without 2 approvals).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule can connect to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;legacy non-SAP apps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(like OCR invoice scanners or in-house workflow systems).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Requires more&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;setup &amp;amp; governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;compared to Public Cloud.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Side-by-Side Comparison&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Activation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Native, plug-and-play&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Needs setup &amp;amp; integration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Invoice Posting&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule executes directly in Fiori app&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule suggests navigation, may require custom agent for automation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Validation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard rules auto-applied&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Flexible, can embed custom compliance rules&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User Effort&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Minimal (voice/text → posted)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Moderate (confirmation in screen, extra steps if no custom agent)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Immediate cash flow impact via SAC&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Possible, but may need manual SAC integration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Limited (SAP-standard process)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Flexible (custom workflows, approvals, legacy integration)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key&amp;nbsp;Takeaway:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Joule =&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;speed + simplicity&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;→ perfect for companies with standard finance processes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Joule =&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;control + flexibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;→ better if you need extra compliance steps, custom posting logic, or hybrid integration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Brazil as One of the Leading Hubs for Artificial Intelligence (2024–2025)</title>

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;Over the past two years, Brazil has established itself as one of the main &lt;STRONG&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&lt;/STRONG&gt; hubs globally, standing out for its combination of &lt;STRONG&gt;public investments&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;expanding business ecosystem&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;regulatory progress&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Traditionally a leader in innovation and technology in Latin America, Brazil is now attracting international attention by accelerating the adoption of AI across strategic sectors such as finance, energy, agribusiness, and public services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;In 2024, the Brazilian government launched the &lt;STRONG&gt;Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Plan (PBIA) 2024–2028&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a program with an estimated investment of &lt;STRONG&gt;R$ 23 billion&lt;/STRONG&gt; dedicated to AI research, development, and infrastructure. The plan aims to strengthen technological sovereignty, foster innovation through universities, and support companies in applying AI to practical use cases, particularly in areas of public interest.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The Main pillars of the PBIA 2024–2028 are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Expansion of &lt;STRONG&gt;AI research&lt;/STRONG&gt; and innovation centers;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tax incentives&lt;/STRONG&gt; for startups and public–private partnerships;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Training&lt;/STRONG&gt; and qualification of AI professionals;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Implementation of &lt;STRONG&gt;AI in public service&lt;/STRONG&gt;s (health, security, education).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;This initiative positions Brazil as a &lt;STRONG&gt;regional leader in AI policy&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ahead of countries like Mexico, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Brazil’s private sector is undergoing a phase of &lt;STRONG&gt;rapid AI adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;. By 2025, a national survey identified &lt;STRONG&gt;396 Brazilian AI companies&lt;/STRONG&gt; focused on marketing applications, reflecting diversification across &lt;STRONG&gt;generative AI, automation, analytics, and digital services&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;According to a &lt;STRONG&gt;Bain &amp;amp; Company (2025)&lt;/STRONG&gt; study, &lt;STRONG&gt;67% of Brazilian companies&lt;/STRONG&gt; now consider AI a &lt;STRONG&gt;strategic priority&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a major leap from 2024, when only about 12% had active projects. This demonstrates the transition from experimental use to &lt;STRONG&gt;mature, production-level adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Brazil received international investments and technological infrastructure. That's why Brazil’s consolidation as an AI hub also stems from the confidence of major global players. In September 2024, &lt;STRONG&gt;Microsoft&lt;/STRONG&gt; announced a &lt;STRONG&gt;US$ 2.7 billion investment&lt;/STRONG&gt; in &lt;STRONG&gt;cloud and AI infrastructure&lt;/STRONG&gt; in Brazil, one of the largest technology investments in Latin American history. In 2025, &lt;STRONG&gt;Eletrobras&lt;/STRONG&gt; partnered with &lt;STRONG&gt;C3 AI&lt;/STRONG&gt; to modernize Brazil’s power grid using AI and machine learning, highlighting the industrial applications of advanced technologies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;These moves strengthen Brazil’s position as a &lt;STRONG&gt;regional hub for data and high-performance computing&lt;/STRONG&gt;, essential for scaling generative AI and automation initiatives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Despite major progress, Brazil still faces structural challenges. A &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Brazil (March 2025)&lt;/STRONG&gt; survey revealed that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;29%&lt;/STRONG&gt; of companies lack clarity on how to integrate AI into their business systems;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;28%&lt;/STRONG&gt; cite a &lt;STRONG&gt;shortage of skilled professionals&lt;/STRONG&gt; as the main obstacle.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;On the regulatory front, Brazil has emerged as a key player. In 2024, the &lt;STRONG&gt;National Data Protection Authority (ANPD)&lt;/STRONG&gt; suspended &lt;STRONG&gt;Meta Platforms’&lt;/STRONG&gt; privacy policy, which used Brazilians’ personal data to train generative AI models. This decision marked an important milestone in &lt;STRONG&gt;ethical governance and digital sovereignty&lt;/STRONG&gt;, aligning Brazil with European-style data protection principles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The main sectors driving AI growth in Brazil include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance and digital payments:&lt;/STRONG&gt; automation and predictive analytics;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Energy:&lt;/STRONG&gt; smart grids and real-time system optimization;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agribusiness:&lt;/STRONG&gt; crop forecasting and climate analytics;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Healthcare:&lt;/STRONG&gt; assisted diagnostics and telemedicine;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public administration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; chatbots and natural language processing for citizen services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;These industries attract investments from both &lt;STRONG&gt;large corporations&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;local startups&lt;/STRONG&gt;, making Brazil a fertile ground for experimentation and innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;About the Outlook for 2025 and Beyond the trends indicate continued expansion of generative AI and process automation in Brazilian companies. &lt;STRONG&gt;By the end of 202&lt;/STRONG&gt;5, it is expected that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Over &lt;STRONG&gt;60% of corporate AI solutions&lt;/STRONG&gt; in Brazil will involve generative models;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The country will consolidate &lt;STRONG&gt;international research and training partnerships&lt;/STRONG&gt;;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;General Artificial Intelligence Law&lt;/STRONG&gt; (under discussion in Congress) will advance the national governance framework.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;With growing public and private investments, Brazil is on track to become a &lt;STRONG&gt;Latin American reference in AI innovation and ethics&lt;/STRONG&gt;, combining &lt;STRONG&gt;economic growth&lt;/STRONG&gt; with &lt;STRONG&gt;responsible technological governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The 2024–2025 period marks a &lt;STRONG&gt;strategic turning point&lt;/STRONG&gt; for AI in Brazil, shifting from an emerging topic to a &lt;STRONG&gt;core pillar of industrial and business competitiveness&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The alignment between &lt;STRONG&gt;government vision&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;international investments&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;technological maturity&lt;/STRONG&gt; positions Brazil as &lt;STRONG&gt;one of the leading AI hubs in the Southern Hemisphere&lt;/STRONG&gt;, with the potential to export technology, talent, and regulatory best practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;At &lt;A class="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/make-value-s-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;MakeValue&lt;/A&gt;, we develop &lt;STRONG&gt;AI-powered applications for SAP Finance&lt;/STRONG&gt;, focused on enhancing financial visibility and decision-making.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In France we have a legal requirement to submit a file of accounting entries for the closed fiscal year in a dematerialized format (Article L47 A I ) which is effective from 01.01.2014.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Upon receiving request from the tax authorities, a company has 15 days to prepare and submit the FEC file. In case of failing to deliver the FEC file or in the event of non-compliance, companies could face significant penalties&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This file consists of entries after inventory operations, excluding centralization entries and excluding entries for balancing expense and revenue accounts. It includes the entries for the recovery of balances from the previous fiscal year and contains, for each entry, all accounting data present in the company's computerized accounting system, with the first eighteen pieces of information required to correspond, in order, to those listed in the following table:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="mmehanna_0-1762325701323.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336357i53CE5D38CE210C0E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="mmehanna_0-1762325701323.png" alt="mmehanna_0-1762325701323.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further information about the legal requirements can be found here&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000037526053" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Article L47 A - Book of Tax Procedures – &lt;/A&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000037526053" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Légifrance&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000027804775" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Article A47 A-1 - Livre des procédures fiscales - Légifrance&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to generate the FEC file from SAP?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;DRC or DART&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It enables you to create, process, and monitor electronic documents and statutory reports.

You can use DART to extract and store data that is relevant to tax from SAP applications at regular intervals. DART extracts the data into sequential files and provides tools that you can use to display and evaluate the stored data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In general, two steps are required in DART to create machine-readable files for the tax auditor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first step in DART involves generating extract files that capture data based on the selected company code and areas like FI, CO, SD, and MM, with customizable restrictions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the second step, extract files are transformed into view files according to tax auditor specifications by defining which segments are included and how they are combined.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further information can be found here&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ERP/ae5c71ff3b1f490fb7f3b1f17bb2c7ee/6f96c2531bb9b44ce10000000a174cb4.html?version=6.05.latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Introduction to the Data Retention Tool (DART) | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What are the technical prerequisites for FEC solution by DART?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The recommendation from SAP is to be on the highest version of DART with all the latest notes implemented.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;you can check the DART version in the SE11.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You should choose there the "TYPE GROUP": DART1.

These postings represent the balance carryforward but do not generate balances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For these postings, no subledger documents (customer/vendor/Asset Accounting) are written.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No open items are generated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report is available for classic General Ledger Accounting and new General Ledger Accounting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The documents are specially indicated:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1) The document status is 'O' (balance sheet opening entry).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2) The reference transaction is 'GLYEC' (year-end closing document).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3) The documents are posted in period '0' of the carryforward year.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Documents are generated for each account, customer, and vendor. Information about the customer and vendor is stored in the LIFNR/KUNNR fields as well as in the assignment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The balances of the respective balance sheet accounts are cleared against "Balance Sheet Account - Opening" on the selection screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The posted documents can be reversed with the FI reversal transactions (FB08/F.80).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span

The screen is the same as the one used by the authorities. You should fill the field "Entrer le numéro alpage du dossier" with your number as the file naming example ("111222333"). This is mandatory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second field is optional; you can write the name of your company into this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also choose the type of your chart of account on the left column (Type de plan comptable) and the type of the revenue category on the right column (Type de revenus). Then you can upload the file to be tested by clicking on the icon "Selectionner un fichier á traiter".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select the relevant local file. After that your can start the test by clicking on the "Valider" button.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the end of the test, a summary document is generated in PDF format. It is automatically displayed and saved. The first page of the summary contains general information about this validation process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second page shows the mandatory fields required by the law and the fields of the actual FEC file next to it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additional notes and comments about the file are displayed on the third page. Generally, these notes have two types: in some cases, these are problems what should be solved in order to get correct file from technical aspect. For example, if there are missing data, it is displayed under the heading „Données absentes”. There are also informational comments, in these cases the file is technically correct. These are displayed under the heading „Observations complémentaires”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="6"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud for Customer Payments - Transition and Future with APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has transitioned&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud for Customer Payments&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;into maintenance mode and removed it from the price list (as of September 2, 2024). The solution will continue to be supported for existing customers under active contracts, but no further development or investments are made. Customers are encouraged to transition to the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;API-based approach&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and On-Premise/Private Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Accounts receivable processes today are often&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;costly, manual, and time-consuming&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Many businesses face delays in cash collection, lack of transparency for their customers, and high operational costs for invoice and payment handling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Marie_Kretz_0-1760374142920.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326868iB8BE50814FF881CF/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Marie_Kretz_0-1760374142920.png" alt="Marie_Kretz_0-1760374142920.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP enables customers and partners to build&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;modern customer-facing portals&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;that accelerate the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;invoice-to-cash process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and support&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;automated cash collection&lt;/STRONG&gt;. These portals empower end customers with self-service capabilities, reducing manual workload while improving the customer experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

successor, but provides&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;greater flexibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;APIs are released for&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA On-Premise, Private Cloud, and
