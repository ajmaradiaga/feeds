    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Organizational Structure - SAP S/4 Hana Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;In order to understand the organogram of any organization, it is essential to learn the functions of every org unit. Just like in a family, some people play the roles of guardians, supervisors and some are only dependents on elder, likewise SAP org units are.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Every organization utilizes its resources to earn profits so from where can we extract the profitability reports? It means there is a unit made responsible to collect information, analyse and report it in every manner that is &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;"CO-PA". (Controlling- Profitability Segment)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;. So, &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Operating Concern &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;is&amp;nbsp;like a super power who sits on the top of the org structure and have all the information. In SAP Public Cloud one operating concern is predefined with name of &lt;STRONG&gt;A000 &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;therefore CO Consultant do not need to create any other.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;It is assigned to controlling area, where all variable and fixed costs of the company is stored. Just like there cannot remain two swords in one sheath, similarly two controlling areas cannot be created.&amp;nbsp;In SAP Public Cloud one controlling area is predefined with name of &lt;STRONG&gt;A000 &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;therefore CO Consultant do not need to create any other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;The world of Finance begin when companies start trading, hence just like we have multiple universes, multiple company codes are assigned to controlling areas. &lt;STRONG&gt;Company code&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the smallest org structure in FI that stores all financial documents line items. It becomes a base for MM and SD structure, an independent family member upon which other gets dependent. Company codes nomenclature can be alpha-numeric. &lt;U&gt;FI Consultant will begin the org structure creation activity in SAP Public Cloud.&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lets take one scenario as an example. lets say a group of companies will be made as a company and its subsidiaries will be configured as separate company codes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Plant is the area which is responsible to record every production activity. What is happening inside a plant, cannot be known to that person who is sitting on the head of the family chair on the dining table. (CO-PA). Therefore, MM Consultant configures the alphanumeric plants to the company codes and with this relation, correct information passes to controlling area and reports of profit gets extracted. Profit is made of Revenue-Costs, so costs are available with controlling area, but what about revenue?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;So we have another stream, another module i,e SD who is solely responsible to dispatch and record sales. Then like a river, it flows into the sea of Finance and gets connected to CO-PA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;MM and SD are two extreme opposite sides, SD is a plus and MM is minus. (Inflows and outflows) MM has its own purchasing org, that can either be centralized or decentralized as per company's policies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Similarly, SD has its own sales org,&amp;nbsp; SD consultant can assign one on multiple company codes or create a decentralized structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;In connection to controlling area. CO consultant designs a hierarchy of cost centers and profit centers to record their activities. Purchases can be found in multiple cost centers, and via report it can be plan to control it. Whereas, sales can be assigned profitability segments to know their contributions in profit figures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Under plant, multiple storage locations for inventory can be configured and assigned and under the same plant, sales area is made. Sales area is the combination of sales org, divisions and distribution channel. The longest activity in org structure is of SD module.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;The material is either procured externally or produced in-house, it moves from plant to warehouse, then stamped in sales office, it dispatches from shipping points to final consumer and consumer happily transfers the receipt in company's bank account. That's how production is materialized into finance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Please note no consultant can begin configuration without completing the organisational structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;It can be edited and recreated later on. but it will lock your workspace for sometime. After doing changes, confirm the units and deploy it onto your configuration server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Reports are formulated with the help of transactions, if a purchase order is made in MM, check the org units, (plant, purchasing org and storage location)&amp;nbsp; will be filled, so automatically it will be assigned to its respective company code and would reach CO-PA. SD will also follow the same in its preliminary financial documents. Hence, create a strong structure to uphold the data in correct formats and form.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Till now, we have &lt;STRONG&gt;CO-FI-MM and SD&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the picture and that's how organisational structure is framed in SAP S/4 Hana Public Cloud. The role of CO is predefined, in Grey cannot be changed in any circumstances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;To state the obvious: Getting your taxes right is an important part of your business, and it’s not an area where you’d typically seek out additional complexities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the shortest possible version of why it’s difficult to change your sales and use tax procedure in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. Your tax procedure is something you set up in your initial scoping, and it is in most cases the deepest asleep of all of your sleeping dogs. Almost all the time, you just want to leave it alone.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Almost. There &lt;EM&gt;are&lt;/EM&gt; times when you need to make a change. Perhaps your business structure has changed sufficiently that you want to move from the internal tax calculation procedure to the external and join up with a tax partner. Or maybe you need to switch tax partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In these cases, with live systems, you need to think carefully, plan for disruption, think again, and plan some more. And then probably do that one more time. Then if you’re going ahead, consult our KBA entitled&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3636110/E" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Information on the Internal Tax Calculation Procedure (TAXUSJ) to the External Tax Calculation Procedure (0TXUSX)&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for more detailed information on the procedure, risks, and potential downtimes associated with such a switch.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Accounting Principles and SAP S/4HANA FI</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;It’s common to hear colleagues from other S4Hana modules express frustration with the complexity and impact of FI/CO on their processes. However, this perception often stems from a fundamental misunderstanding: the organizational structure of SAP S/4HANA Finance is not merely technical; it is the practical embodiment of the accounting principles that govern the financial governance of any organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every object, from Company Code to Segment, is meticulously designed to ensure that financial records adhere to the pillars of accounting—promoting integrity, transparency, and, crucially, supporting strategic decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This article explores the intrinsic relationship between accounting principles and organizational objects in SAP S/4HANA FI, demystifying why their influence is so broad and vital to a company’s financial health. Get ready for an analysis that goes beyond technical configuration, diving into the accounting logic behind each system structure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’ve broken the concepts into levels to make them easier to understand.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1737925313"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1541411808"&gt;Level 1: The Legal Entity and Going Concern in SAP S/4HANA&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The starting point of any robust accounting system lies in properly defining the entity and in the premise of its uninterrupted operation. In SAP S/4HANA, these concepts are solidly embedded in its foundational organizational objects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1473981022"&gt;Entity Principle: The Company Code as the Legal Unit&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Entity Principle is one of the pillars of accounting, establishing that a company’s assets are distinct from those of its owners or shareholders. Accounting is therefore maintained for the business entity as an economically and legally separate unit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Company Code&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the most direct and crucial representation of this principle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Company Code is the smallest organizational unit for which a complete and self-contained set of accounts can be created, enabling the generation of external financial statements such as Balance Sheets and Income Statements, as required by law. Configuring a Company Code in SAP is, in fact, defining the legal and asset boundaries that the Entity Principle demands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All financial transactions—whether purchases, sales, or payments—are recorded within a specific Company Code, ensuring segregation and clarity of each legal entity’s finances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="1.jpg" style="width: 428px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303540iB1414A4D5BF39CAA/image-dimensions/428x428?v=v2" width="428" height="428" role="button" title="1.jpg" alt="1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Going Concern Principle: The Long-Term Assumption in FI-AA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Going Concern Principle assumes that the entity will continue operating indefinitely, with no intent of liquidation or significant downsizing. This is fundamental for classifying assets and liabilities (current vs. non-current) and, notably, for depreciating assets over their useful lives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the long-term existence of the Company Code, together with specific modules like Fixed Assets (FI-AA), reflects this principle directly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;FI-AA, configured per Company Code, manages asset depreciation across multiple years—a process that only makes sense under the assumption of continued operations. The system is inherently designed to handle the full lifecycle of assets and liabilities, which is a direct and systemic application of the Going Concern Principle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1148384798"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-951871293"&gt;Level 2: Measurement and Recording of Activities – The Basis of Accounting in S/4HANA&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the entity is established, the next step is ensuring all financial activities are measured and recorded consistently and accurately. SAP S/4HANA provides robust tools aligned with essential accounting principles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-884440507"&gt;Monetary Unit Principle: Currency and Chart of Accounts&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Monetary Unit Principle requires all transactions and economic events to be expressed in a single currency. This enables aggregation, comparison, and consistent analysis of financial data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, this principle is realized through the &lt;STRONG&gt;Company Code Currency&lt;/STRONG&gt; and the &lt;STRONG&gt;Chart of Accounts&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each Company Code is configured with a local currency (e.g., BRL, USD), in which all legal reports are generated. Regardless of the original transaction currency, amounts are converted and recorded in this common denominator. The Chart of Accounts, assigned to the Company Code, provides the structured hierarchy for recording economic events in an organized and standardized manner, allocating monetary values to categories such as Assets, Liabilities, Revenue, and Expenses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2.jpg" style="width: 379px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303541i965C7B87AF34579A/image-dimensions/379x379?v=v2" width="379" height="379" role="button" title="2.jpg" alt="2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accrual and Matching Principles: The Universal Journal as the Core of Recording&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Accrual and Matching Principles are critical for accurate income determination.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accrual Principle&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Revenues and expenses must be recognized in the period in which they are generated, regardless of cash flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Matching Principle&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Revenues must be matched with the expenses that contributed to generating them, preventing distortions in the Income Statement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP S/4HANA fundamentally operates on an accrual basis. &lt;STRONG&gt;Fiscal Year Variants&lt;/STRONG&gt; structure periods (usually monthly) and control postings, ensuring that an August sales invoice is recorded in August, even if payment occurs in September.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Universal Journal (ACDOCA table)&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the “single source of truth.” Every posting of revenue or expense is registered with both posting and document dates, ensuring proper period recognition. By unifying FI and CO data, the Universal Journal enables direct matching of revenues with their related costs—all in one place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Native integration across SD (Sales &amp;amp; Distribution), MM (Materials Management), and FI automates matching. For instance, a goods issue in SD automatically triggers inventory reduction in MM and simultaneously records both Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and revenue in FI. Likewise, FI-AA automatically posts depreciation monthly, while Cost Centers in CO record operating expenses that can be matched against generated results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-558844283"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="3.jpg" style="width: 409px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303542iC09735CC0A5557FD/image-dimensions/409x409?v=v2" width="409" height="409" role="button" title="3.jpg" alt="3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-362330778"&gt;Level 3: Managerial Analysis and Reporting – Beyond Statutory Accounting&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond legal requirements, managers need granular insight into business performance. SAP S/4HANA applies accounting principles at an internal level to provide valuable managerial insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-294899992"&gt;Segment Reporting (IFRS 8): The Segment Object&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;IFRS 8 (CPC 22 in Brazil) requires publicly traded companies to disclose information about their operating segments, enabling investors to analyze the business as management does.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Segment&lt;/STRONG&gt; object is specifically designed for this. Derived at posting (often from Profit Centers), it enables real-time balance sheets and income statements per segment via the Universal Journal, providing unprecedented transparency into performance across business lines or geographies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="4.jpg" style="width: 265px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303528iEE83D45747FCAF63/image-dimensions/265x265?v=v2" width="265" height="265" role="button" title="4.jpg" alt="4.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-98386487"&gt;Internal Matching Principle: Profit Center and Cost Center&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;For managerial performance evaluation, revenues must be matched with the costs incurred to generate them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Profit Center&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Represents a unit accountable for its own P&amp;amp;L, capturing revenues and expenses. It applies the matching principle internally, enabling profitability analysis of products, branches, or divisions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost Center&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Represents where costs are incurred (e.g., HR, IT), without directly generating revenue. Costs are controlled here and can later be allocated to Profit Centers for full profitability analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Together, Profit and Cost Centers close the cycle of internal matching.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="5.jpg" style="width: 373px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303529iE7E86DF212110A4E/image-dimensions/373x373?v=v2" width="373" height="373" role="button" title="5.jpg" alt="5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prudence (Conservatism) Principle: Credit Control Area&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Prudence Principle dictates that, when in doubt, record the least favorable outcome—lower assets/revenues and higher liabilities/expenses. In practice, this means caution and recognition of probable losses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Credit Control Area&lt;/STRONG&gt; embodies this principle. By setting credit limits and monitoring exposures, it helps manage default risk. Functionality like provisions for doubtful accounts (bad debt allowances) within FI applies prudence directly, recognizing probable expenses before losses materialize.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="6.png" style="width: 377px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303530i50E278EE7D4B2FC6/image-dimensions/377x377?v=v2" width="377" height="377" role="button" title="6.png" alt="6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Level 4: Information Quality and Systemic Governance in S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Building an accounting structure is just step one. The next, equally critical, is ensuring that the information flowing through it is reliable, consistent, and accurate. SAP S/4HANA achieves this via its integrated architecture and intrinsic controls—systemic embodiments of governance and data quality principles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--173358387"&gt;Consistency Principle: Operational Chart of Accounts and Posting Models&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Consistency Principle requires that companies apply the same accounting practices across periods, allowing comparability over time. Changes are allowed only if preferable and properly disclosed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Operational Chart of Accounts&lt;/STRONG&gt;—once defined—becomes the backbone of all postings. Using a single chart across a group ensures uniform treatment of similar transactions across entities. Posting Models and Screen Variants enforce standardized postings for recurring transactions, reinforcing consistency and reducing manual errors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--369871892"&gt;Integrity, Completeness, and Synchronization of Data: Universal Journal and Native Integration&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data governance principles—Integrity, Completeness, Synchronization—are fundamental to information reliability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integrity&lt;/STRONG&gt; ensures accuracy and trustworthiness.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Completeness&lt;/STRONG&gt; ensures all required data is captured.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Synchronization&lt;/STRONG&gt; ensures consistency across accounting, managerial, and logistics views.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Universal Journal&lt;/STRONG&gt; achieves this by merging FI, CO, FI-AA, CO-PA, and ML into a single line-item repository. This eliminates complex reconciliations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Native integration ensures that when goods movement is posted in MM, the corresponding FI entry is simultaneously generated. No batch transfers that can fail; if one part fails, the transaction is reversed entirely, ensuring integrity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Universal Journal structure, containing all relevant fields (company, account, cost center, profit center, segment, etc.) in one table, ensures completeness. Its “single source of truth” architecture means all views—statutory and managerial—are instantly updated, eliminating reconciliations that plagued earlier SAP versions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="7.jpg" style="width: 362px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303531i6E51FD0650E89A8A/image-dimensions/362x362?v=v2" width="362" height="362" role="button" title="7.jpg" alt="7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion: SAP S/4HANA as an Enabler of Accounting Governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Understanding the deep connection between accounting principles and SAP S/4HANA FI architecture is crucial for every consultant. Far from being just a transactional system, S/4HANA is a platform that &lt;STRONG&gt;incorporates and automates accounting principles&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensuring not only legal compliance but also real-time financial insights for strategic decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By mastering this synergy, consultants can go beyond technical configuration and act as true business partners—optimizing processes, safeguarding data integrity, and maximizing the value SAP S/4HANA delivers to financial governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The evolution of ERP into S/4HANA represents a qualitative leap in how companies manage their finances—transforming accounting principles into operational and strategic reality.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Mass Download Of Attachment In SAP Document / Invoice - SAP S4HANA / FICO</title>

    <content>&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP offers various functionalities to manage attachments, but the mass download of invoice attachments is not a standard, out-of-the-box feature. This is a common pain point for many SAP users, especially in Accounts Payable departments, who need to archive or audit a large volume of invoices with their corresponding attachments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post, we will explore the different ways to achieve this, from standard transactions to custom solutions, providing a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to streamline this process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1889024421"&gt;&lt;U&gt;The Challenge of Mass Attachment Download in SAP&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard SAP transactions like FB03 (Display Document) or MIR4 (Display Invoice Document) allow you to view attachments individually. However, they lack a function to download a large number of attachments at once. This becomes a significant bottleneck when:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Auditing:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You need to provide a complete set of invoices and attachments to internal or external auditors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Archiving:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You are migrating documents to an external content management system or preparing for a system shutdown.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reporting:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You need to extract a bulk of data with attachments for analytical purposes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, how can you tackle this challenge? Let's delve into the methods available.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1692510916"&gt;Method 1: The Manual, Item-by-Item Approach (Not Recommended for Mass)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This method is only feasible for a very small number of invoices and serves as a good starting point to understand where attachments are stored.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigate to the Invoice:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Use transaction FB03 (for FI documents) or MIR4 (for Logistics Invoice Verification).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Access the Services for Object icon:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is the small icon with a paperclip and a piece of paper, typically found in the top-left corner of the screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;View and Download:&lt;/STRONG&gt; From the dropdown menu, select Attachment list. A window will pop up showing all the attachments linked to that document. You can then select and download each one individually.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why this isn't a long-term solution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This process is extremely time-consuming and prone to human error. It's simply not practical for mass downloads.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1495997411"&gt;Method 2: The Semi-Automated SO_OBJECT_DOWNLOAD Function Module&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For those with some technical know-how, this method provides a way to download attachments programmatically, but still on a document-by-document basis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Identify the Document Key:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Each attachment is linked to an object key in SAP. You can find this by navigating to SOBJ table or through the attachment list pop-up screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Execute SO_OBJECT_DOWNLOAD:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Go to transaction SE37 and execute the function module SO_OBJECT_DOWNLOAD.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Provide the Object Key:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In the function module parameters, input the object key of the attachment you want to download. You can then execute it to save the file to your local drive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Limitations:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This method is still not a true "mass" download solution. It requires you to know the object key for each attachment, which means you would need to write a custom program to get this data in the first place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1299483906"&gt;Method 3: The Custom ABAP Program (The Most Effective Solution)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the most common and robust solution for mass downloads. It requires the expertise of an ABAP developer but provides the flexibility to meet your specific business requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How a Custom Program Works:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A well-designed ABAP program for mass downloads would typically follow these steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Input Parameters:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The program should have a selection screen where the user can input a range of invoice document numbers, vendor numbers, posting dates, or other relevant criteria.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Retrieve Document List:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The program will read the relevant SAP tables (e.g., BKPF for document headers, RSEG for invoice documents) to get a list of all invoices that meet the selection criteria.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Link to Attachments:&lt;/STRONG&gt; For each invoice document found, the program will query the attachment tables. The primary tables for object links are SRGBTBREL (Relations between Business Objects) and SOFFCONT1 (the actual content of the documents).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Download and Save:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The program will then loop through each attachment found, retrieve its content from SOFFCONT1, and save it to a specified folder on the user's local machine or a network drive. The filename can be dynamically generated using the invoice number, vendor number, or other relevant data for easy identification.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Logging and Reporting:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The program should generate a log showing which documents were processed, which attachments were downloaded successfully, and which ones failed (e.g., if there was no attachment).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&amp;amp;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

For true mass downloads, a &lt;STRONG&gt;custom ABAP program is the most efficient and recommended solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It's a one-time development effort that can save significant time and effort in the long run, particularly for Accounts Payable teams, auditors, and IT administrators.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are facing this challenge, consider reaching out to your in-house ABAP team or an SAP consulting partner to develop a custom solution that fits your business needs perfectly.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Additionally, governance and compliance requirements can become overly burdensome, consuming valuable time with extensive data collection and documentation efforts. Furthermore, there is frequently a lack of transparency and insight across system boundaries, which hampers decision-making and collaboration. Tackling these issues requires a strategic approach that involves process optimization, technology adoption, and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt; in financial management systems are designed to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and communication.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Managing validation rules and groups standardizes these processes, preventing financial misstatements and reducing audit and compliance risks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automated balance validation tasks accelerate the closing process and minimize manual efforts, freeing up valuable time for strategic activities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Real-time validation analytics provide immediate insights and maintain a comprehensive audit trail, ensuring transparency and accountability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The ability to add comments facilitates smooth communication between subsidiaries and headquarters, ensuring alignment and reducing misunderstandings. Together, these capabilities transform financial operations, driving reliability and efficiency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141114.png" style="width: 877px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316258i2D590B411E8CEE4B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141114.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141114.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Balance Validation plays a critical role in supporting &lt;STRONG&gt;Accounting&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Group Reporting&lt;/STRONG&gt;, especially when integrated with &lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced Financial Closing&lt;/STRONG&gt; processes. This function ensures that all accounts are accurately reconciled and validated, providing a strong foundation for precise financial reporting. By incorporating Balance Validation into the closing cycle, organizations can identify discrepancies early, reduce errors, and enhance the integrity of their financial statements. This integration not only accelerates the closing process but also strengthens group reporting by ensuring consistent and reliable data across all levels of the organization, thereby supporting compliance and informed strategic decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141226.png" style="width: 876px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316259iE319C17832A12784/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141226.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141226.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application of &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Balance Validation Rules and Groups&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides a centralized platform for defining and managing validation rules that prevent financial misstatements and mitigate compliance risks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141350.png" style="width: 822px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316260iDB3E639A0410F54B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141350.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141350.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141421.png" style="width: 810px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316261iF53DB8D0D86201FE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141421.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141421.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141503.png" style="width: 808px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316262iA59E3377A2CBD18A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141503.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141503.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application &lt;STRONG&gt;Scheduled Balance Validation Jobs&lt;/STRONG&gt; accelerates the financial closing cycle while significantly reducing manual workload by&amp;nbsp;automating balance validation tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141546.png" style="width: 817px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316263i2C8A5DFFD88642BE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141546.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-18 141546.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The application&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;View Balance Validation Results&lt;/STRONG&gt; offers immediate insights and maintains an audit trail, ensuring transparency.

Users can subsequently review the draft, make necessary adjustments, and save or activate the rule, ensuring it aligns with organizational requirements and enhances the accuracy and efficiency of financial operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="image (4).png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316265i2FD35F15DB65D1B2/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="image (4).png" alt="image (4).png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="image (5).png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316266i5A6AFE815C48DCB5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="image (5).png" alt="image (5).png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is the help document about Balance Validation capability,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0fa84c9d9c634132b7c4abb9ffdd8f06/8c1fce9f709f482cb890bc440fbb79bd.html?version=2508.VAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Balance Validation | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Enterprises are rethinking how to connect banking capabilities with ERP processes to maximize business value. Key questions include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to make payments, reconciliation, and cash visibility seamless and fully integrated between banks and the ERP system?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to adopt innovations like real-time payments or real-time cash balances without launching a new IT project every time a banking service gets added?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to unlock the combined value of invoice and payment data in the ERP alongside the cash and financial data held by banks?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP and J.P. Morgan asked themselves the same questions. And as a result decided to collaborate and partner even closer to bring more value to shared clients by better integrating the capabilities of both by accelerating adoption of SAP Multi-Bank Connectivity (MBC) to deliver J.P.

    <title>Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion (UCFC)/CustOnTmp</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is CustOnTmp&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The downtime-optimized conversion (doC) executes the FIN data conversion on the temporary instance during the uptime. For this, SUM needs the FIN Customizing to apply it prior to the data conversion. Until now, this required a standard conversion run prior to each doC run. In this standard run, the FIN Customizing was created and added to a transport request. Such a transport request is required to be provided to each doC run.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the new feature Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion, FIN delta Customizing activities can be performed directly on the temporary instance of the doC run. With this, the number of required standard conversion runs is reduced to one standard conversion at the beginning of the project. All FIN delta Customizing activities can be directly done on the temporary instance of the doC run. For each new doC iteration, the initial FIN Customizing transport request is used (created in standard conversion) together with all the delta Customizing transport requests prepared with each new iteration.&amp;nbsp; It is no longer required to always run a standard conversion before each doC cycle&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Target release SAP S/4HANA&amp;nbsp;2022&amp;nbsp;(or higher)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;DOC with database migration (so no in place conversion; migration is possible also for source on SAP HANA)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SUM 2.0 SP 23 (or higher)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Differences Between Standard doC and Uptime Customizing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The uptime customizing will by default add most application tables to the uptime handling automatically. This means, the manual selection of tables for uptime migration becomes mostly obsolete. The SUM will no longer display the respective section on downtime-optimized DMO (with file specification "table list"). If there are still tables which cause a significant runtime during phase&amp;nbsp;EU_CLONE_MIG_DT_RUN they can still be added manually using CRRTABLIST.LST as in regular doC approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every application table in uptime handling gets either a replication trigger or a freeze trigger in the source system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The reasons for a freeze trigger are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customizing table with delivery class C, E or G&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Static classification in SUM which requires a read-only restriction&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Freeze Trigger&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Freeze triggers are needed to ensure the consistency of the uptime conversion. Freeze triggers are used in 3 different ways as below&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hard Freeze&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Freeze triggers are used to prevent customizing changes in the source system which might influence and invalidate the uptime conversion which is done in parallel to production on the temporary instance. This means that the number of freeze tables is significantly higher as in regular doC approach, although it should not add additional business restrictions as most of the freeze triggers are defined on pure customizing table which are not changed directly in a productive system. Nevertheless, the Impact analysis is of a higher importance for the doC with Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion&amp;nbsp;approach. The hard freeze will be activated during the preparation in phase SQLDB_FREEZE_TRIG_MODE_SWITCH_SMIG_TCR and will remain until the end of the doC procedure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please refer the&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;to SAP Note&amp;nbsp;2481983&amp;nbsp;- SUM Impact Analysis for downtime-optimized DMO&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Temporary Freeze&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some tables only be set read-only for a short period of time, for example while the Asset Accounting is prepared for the Uptime Conversion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Freeze on Temporary System&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;There will be freeze triggers used on the temporary instance between the SUM phases&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;RUN_SMIG_SFIN_CUST_ON_TEMP_FREEZE&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;RUN_SMIG_SFIN_CUST_ON_TEMP_FREEZE_REV&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As tables must only be changed either by production operation (business users on system) on source system or by the customizing activities on the temporary system, all tables which can be changed by production operation will be set to read-only on the temporary system to avoid conflicting changes. It is, therefore, possible that a Customizing activity on the temporary instance fails with a short dump. In this case, create an incident&amp;nbsp; on component BC-UPG-DTM-TLA to clarify the access.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some tables can be changed on source system and temporary system. Additionally, it is ensured that this does not cause a conflict or there is a special handling implementation like for number ranges.&amp;nbsp;For more information, refer to section&amp;nbsp;3.1 Number Ranges&amp;nbsp;in this SAP Note.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Execution&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During each doC execution, you&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;must&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;check in phase REQ_DOCMAX_DELTA_CUSTOMIZING&amp;nbsp;that the provided FIN customizing that was added via CTI buffer is still valid.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;doC with Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion&amp;nbsp;allows to add additional Customizing directly shortly before the uptime phase&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;PARRUN_SMIG_SFIN&lt;/EM&gt;. To do so, perform the following steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SUM will stop in dialog phase REQ_DOCMAX_DELTA_CUSTOMIZING.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Perform the IMG activities listed under "IMG/Conversion of Accounting to SAP S/4HANA / Preparations and Migration of Customizing" in each relevant client. Use transaction SPRO in the respective clients to perform the needed customizing steps.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;U&gt;Note&lt;/U&gt;: to identify if there are any delta customizing activities required, the customizing activities must be executed step by step (this information can't be provided by the tool).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Remark:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The Customizing activities must be strictly restricted to the required Finance conversion Customizing.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;3.&amp;nbsp; Start the uptime FIN conversion by continuing SUM&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Restricted tables for Uptime Handling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following tables must not be added manually to uptime using CRRTABLIST.LST to avoid potential issues during Delta Customizing for the S/4HANA Finance Conversion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;BALHDR, BALDAT and BAL_INDX&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customizing on the Temporary Instance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Preparation of Number Range “RF_BELEG” for New Document Type for Postings in Controlling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;When using the Uptime Customizing for Finance Conversion&amp;nbsp;approach, the preparation of data migration requires a new document type for postings in Controlling that considers also a new number range object “RF_BELEG”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Available options for Number Range Number definition for controlling document type:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In target system(S/4HANA):After SFIN Data Migration completion, before releasing the system to business users (the recommended one)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;During S/4HANA&amp;nbsp;Standard&amp;nbsp;Customizing preparation with the inclusion into the FI customizing transport request of the CO number ranges numbers;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In source system (ECC): Before the start of S/4HANA technical activities&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Preparations and Migration of Customizing for Controlling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Maintain Operating Concern (KEA0)” on the temporary instance is not possible due to read-only restriction on table&amp;nbsp;TKES2 and&amp;nbsp;CEFORMT.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Is SAP Joule?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Joule is SAP’s AI copilot embedded across its cloud applications. It offers four interaction types—&lt;STRONG&gt;Transactional&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigational&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Informational&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analytical&lt;/STRONG&gt;—that let users perform business tasks via natural language within SAP environments. It understands user context, roles, permissions, and remains secure by design. It can also ground responses in your own business documents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How SAP Joule works in Public vs. Private Cloud is one of the most important considerations for finance teams (especially in FICO) deciding on adoption.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here’s a structured view:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SAP Joule in Public vs. Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deployment &amp;amp; Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule is natively embedded and updated by SAP automatically.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration with SAP FICO apps (GL, AP, AR, Asset Accounting, Controlling) is out of the box.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No additional installation required - users just activate and configure.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule can be enabled, but may require additional setup and integration.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Some Joule features might lag behind public cloud, because public gets innovations first.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Still integrates with FICO, but might require extra configuration &amp;amp; tenant connections to SAP BTP.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Feature Availability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule supports all 4 interaction types (Transactional, Navigational, Informational, Analytical) directly in Fiori apps.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example in FICO: “Post vendor invoice” → transaction executes directly.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Faster delivery of Joule Agents and Joule Studio.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Informational &amp;amp; Analytical features available early (queries, reports, insights).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transactional flows may require enablement through custom skills/agents.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio can still be connected via SAP BTP, but adoption speed depends on customer’s upgrade cycle.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customization &amp;amp; Extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Limited custom coding—extensions must go through SAP BTP side-by-side development.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule skills/agents are mostly standardized.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Great if you want speed &amp;amp; standardization.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;More flexibility: you can create custom FICO processes, reports, and Joule agents.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Easier to integrate with on-prem or legacy systems.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Suited for companies with complex finance processes.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Security &amp;amp; Residency&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data is hosted on SAP-managed hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP, SAP DCs).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule queries financial data via secure APIs; customers rely on SAP’s compliance.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;You control hosting, location, and more of the security stack.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Some finance-heavy industries (banking, defense, public sector) may prefer this for regulatory reasons.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Upgrade &amp;amp; Innovation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quarterly upgrades → Joule features arrive first and fastest.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example: New Joule Agents for FICO tasks (like dispute resolution) appear immediately.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Annual upgrades (with optional Feature Packs).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule features arrive later—innovation follows public cloud by a few cycles.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Comparison Table&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Aspect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Availability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Native, out-of-the-box&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Needs setup, later adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Updates&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quarterly, fastest innovations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Annual/controlled upgrades&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Limited, BTP-based&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Flexible, deep customizations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-managed hyperscalers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customer-controlled&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FICO Use Cases&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Immediate transactional &amp;amp; analytical support&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Strong for complex, regulated finance scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fully available&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Available via BTP, more flexible&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Which is Better for FICO?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud → Best if you want rapid innovation, standard finance processes, faster AI adoption.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud → Best if you need deep customization, strict compliance, hybrid IT integration.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule version requirements&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for S/4HANA Cloud editions (Public and Private):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule arrived&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;as part of the Public Cloud starting around&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q3 2024&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and is embedded in all releases thereafter, including&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2408 (August 2024)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and onward.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;While Joule is built into these releases, you&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;still need proper entitlement and authorization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;to use it; this may require activation via your SAP admin or account executive.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;There are setup guides available detailing&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;how to activate Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;once entitlement is granted.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In Summary:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If your system is on&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud release 2408 (Aug 2024)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;or later, Joule is already supported—assuming you've got the right access and permissions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule is available in the Private Cloud as well, but&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;requires setup and configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It's not automatically active—you must enable it via&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP and Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Technical prerequisites include ensuring the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;UI5 version&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;in your system meets or exceeds the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;minimum required&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for Joule integration. The specific UI5 version will depend on your release; you can consult SAP documentation for exact details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In Summary:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Private Cloud systems can support Joule—but you must set it up, ensure the UI5 stack is compatible, and configure the feature via BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise (Classic)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule is not supported on on-premise S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;. SAP has confirmed it's&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;not on the current roadmap for classic on-premise systems&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;There’s a planned strategy—possibly coming&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q1 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;—to enable Joule via&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Work Zone, BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;even for on-prem systems. But as of now,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule remains unavailable on-prem and unsupported&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;High-Level Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Edition&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supported from (release)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Requirements&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;2408 (Aug 2024) onward&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Needs entitlement/authorization &amp;amp; activation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Post-2024 releases&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Requires UI5 prerequisites + BTP/Joule Studio setup&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;On-Premise (classic)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not supported (as of now)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;No Joule availability; roadmap may include future BTP-based solution&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Joule is supported starting with&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2408 onward&lt;/STRONG&gt;—activate it via entitlement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Joule is available but not automatic—requires UI compliance + setup via BTP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;On-Premise&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Joule is not supported yet; no built-in version availability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s how&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP’s generative AI assistant, can be applied specifically within the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP FICO&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(Finance &amp;amp; Controlling) domain:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule Application in FICO&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transactional Interactions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule allows users to perform CRUD operations and manage financial documents via natural language—imagine asking:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;“Post a vendor invoice of $5,000 to account X with due date Y.”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;“Show me the status of PO invoice 10234.”&lt;BR /&gt;While SAP hasn't yet released out-of-the-box FICO conversational flows, Joule’s transactional model supports this kind of interaction across cloud applications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigational Interactions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of navigating through menus to reach Fiori apps like “Display GL Account Balances,” you could simply ask:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;“Where can I review G/L balances?”&lt;BR /&gt;Joule will direct you to the relevant screen.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Informational Interactions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Straight answers instead of digging through help docs. You can ask:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;“What’s the difference between cost center and profit center accounting?”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;“Explain account determination for automatic postings.”&lt;BR /&gt;Joule will deliver concise explanations, referencing SAP documentation or your own policy documents.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analytical Interactions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule bridges your natural-language queries to data analytics:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;“Show me quarterly expense trends per cost center.”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;“Which cost centers exceeded budget last quarter?”&lt;BR /&gt;It returns charts, metrics, or dashboards—leveraging SAP Analytics Cloud integration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced: Joule Agents &amp;amp; Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Agents&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has introduced&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI agents&lt;/STRONG&gt;—autonomous actors capable of executing complex, multi-step workflows across business functions. In FICO, custom agents could:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automate dispute resolution:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Collaborate across finance and service teams to validate discrepancies and propose corrections.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cash collection workflows:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Analyze overdue invoices, coordinate with collections, and initiate follow-ups.&lt;BR /&gt;These agents are part of SAP’s cross-functional automation strategy.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio (within SAP Build)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No-code/low-code tool to create custom skills or agents tailored for your FICO needs:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Build a skill to automatically generate internal financial reports, or trigger approval workflows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automate vendor reconciliation or recurring postings by designing tailored AI agents.&lt;BR /&gt;These skills and agents integrate across SAP and non-SAP systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary Table&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Capability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;FICO Use Case Example&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transactional&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Post invoices, check payment status via natural language&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Navigational&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ask “Where to view Cost Center Reports?”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Informational&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clarify financial terms or posting rules&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Analytical&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Generate trends and KPI charts using SAC&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agents &amp;amp; Studio&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Automate dispute resolution, cash collection, approvals&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Benefits in FICO&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Boost Productivity&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Save time by speaking instead of clicking through screens.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reduce Errors&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Leverage conversational clarity and auto-generated documents.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Conduct data reviews and root cause analysis through simple dialogue.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automate Complex Workflows&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Agents handle multi-step tasks such as reconciliations or approvals automatically.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Real-World Usage Context -- Caveats&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While SAP is rapidly developing Joule’s capabilities, many implementations remain in pilot or PoC stages. Users in forums report limited early usage, primarily for basic navigation or queries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;concrete FICO scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;where you could&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;pilot SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and even

/&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“Which cost centers exceeded budget last quarter?”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Action:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Shows variances with drill-down.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extension with Agent:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Automatically notify budget owners when variances exceed a threshold (say 10%).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;How to Design in Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio (within SAP Build)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;you can:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create a Skill&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;→ “Generate quarterly P&amp;amp;L by company code and send PDF to finance team.”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create an Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;→ “Monitor overdue vendor payments and auto-initiate dunning.”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Connect Non-SAP Apps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;→ e.g., send approvals via MS Teams or Slack.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This way, Joule moves from a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;copilot&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(answering queries) to a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;colleague&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(executing finance tasks for you).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deep Dive on one of the real-world example: Vendor Invoice Posting with SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;in&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public vs Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Example:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Vendor Invoice Posting with Joule&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Scenario&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A finance user wants to post a vendor invoice for&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Vendor 300012&lt;/STRONG&gt;, amount&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;$12,000&lt;/STRONG&gt;, due in 30 days.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Public Cloud (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User says to Joule:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“Post a vendor invoice of $12,000 for Vendor 300012, due in 30 days.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Process:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Understands the intent (“Create Vendor Invoice”).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pulls relevant master data (Vendor 300012 details, tax code, payment terms).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pre-fills the invoice screen in Fiori.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;User confirms → Invoice is posted.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extras in Public Cloud:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule can immediately display the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;document number&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;due date schedule&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If connected to SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC), Joule can also show how this impacts&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;cash outflow forecast&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Minimal setup → available out-of-the-box.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Private Cloud (SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User says to Joule:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“Post a vendor invoice of $12,000 for Vendor 300012, due in 30 days.”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Process:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Provide navigation → “Open FB60 (Vendor Invoice Entry)” or “Fiori App: Create Supplier Invoice.”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pre-fill metadata only if integrated with custom Joule Skill via&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule recognizes intent, but instead of direct posting, it may:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;User manually confirms or adjusts in the classic posting screen (e.g., FB60 / MIRO).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Invoice is posted.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extras in Private Cloud:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;customize Joule Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(via Joule Studio + BTP) to enforce company-specific validations (e.g., block invoices &amp;gt;$10,000 without 2 approvals).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule can connect to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;legacy non-SAP apps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(like OCR invoice scanners or in-house workflow systems).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Requires more&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;setup &amp;amp; governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;compared to Public Cloud.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Side-by-Side Comparison&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Activation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Native, plug-and-play&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Needs setup &amp;amp; integration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Invoice Posting&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule executes directly in Fiori app&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule suggests navigation, may require custom agent for automation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Validation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard rules auto-applied&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Flexible, can embed custom compliance rules&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User Effort&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Minimal (voice/text → posted)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Moderate (confirmation in screen, extra steps if no custom agent)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Immediate cash flow impact via SAC&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Possible, but may need manual SAC integration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Limited (SAP-standard

flexibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;→ better if you need extra compliance steps, custom posting logic, or hybrid

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;Over the past two years, Brazil has established itself as one of the main &lt;STRONG&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&lt;/STRONG&gt; hubs globally, standing out for its combination of &lt;STRONG&gt;public investments&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;expanding business ecosystem&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;regulatory progress&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Traditionally a leader in innovation and technology in Latin America, Brazil is now attracting international attention by accelerating the adoption of AI across strategic sectors such as finance, energy, agribusiness, and public services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;In 2024, the Brazilian government launched the &lt;STRONG&gt;Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Plan (PBIA) 2024–2028&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a program with an estimated investment of &lt;STRONG&gt;R$ 23 billion&lt;/STRONG&gt; dedicated to AI research, development, and infrastructure. The plan aims to strengthen technological sovereignty, foster innovation through universities, and support companies in applying AI to practical use cases, particularly in areas of public interest.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The Main pillars of the PBIA 2024–2028 are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Expansion of &lt;STRONG&gt;AI research&lt;/STRONG&gt; and innovation centers;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tax incentives&lt;/STRONG&gt; for startups and public–private partnerships;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Training&lt;/STRONG&gt; and qualification of AI professionals;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Implementation of &lt;STRONG&gt;AI in public service&lt;/STRONG&gt;s (health, security, education).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;This initiative positions Brazil as a &lt;STRONG&gt;regional leader in AI policy&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ahead of countries like Mexico, Chile, and Argentina.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Brazil’s private sector is undergoing a phase of &lt;STRONG&gt;rapid AI adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;. By 2025, a national survey identified &lt;STRONG&gt;396 Brazilian AI companies&lt;/STRONG&gt; focused on marketing applications, reflecting diversification across &lt;STRONG&gt;generative AI, automation, analytics, and digital services&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;According to a &lt;STRONG&gt;Bain &amp;amp; Company (2025)&lt;/STRONG&gt; study, &lt;STRONG&gt;67% of Brazilian companies&lt;/STRONG&gt; now consider AI a &lt;STRONG&gt;strategic priority&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a major leap from 2024, when only about 12% had active projects. This demonstrates the transition from experimental use to &lt;STRONG&gt;mature, production-level adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Brazil received international investments and technological infrastructure. That's why Brazil’s consolidation as an AI hub also stems from the confidence of major global players. In September 2024, &lt;STRONG&gt;Microsoft&lt;/STRONG&gt; announced a &lt;STRONG&gt;US$ 2.7 billion investment&lt;/STRONG&gt; in &lt;STRONG&gt;cloud and AI infrastructure&lt;/STRONG&gt; in Brazil, one of the largest technology investments in Latin American history. In 2025, &lt;STRONG&gt;Eletrobras&lt;/STRONG&gt; partnered with &lt;STRONG&gt;C3 AI&lt;/STRONG&gt; to modernize Brazil’s power grid using AI and machine learning, highlighting the industrial applications of advanced technologies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;These moves strengthen Brazil’s position as a &lt;STRONG&gt;regional hub for data and high-performance computing&lt;/STRONG&gt;, essential for scaling generative AI and automation initiatives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Despite major progress, Brazil still faces structural challenges. A &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Brazil (March 2025)&lt;/STRONG&gt; survey revealed that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;29%&lt;/STRONG&gt; of companies lack clarity on how to integrate AI into their business systems;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;28%&lt;/STRONG&gt; cite a &lt;STRONG&gt;shortage of skilled professionals&lt;/STRONG&gt; as the main obstacle.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;On the regulatory front, Brazil has emerged as a key player. In 2024, the &lt;STRONG&gt;National Data Protection Authority (ANPD)&lt;/STRONG&gt; suspended &lt;STRONG&gt;Meta Platforms’&lt;/STRONG&gt; privacy policy, which used Brazilians’ personal data to train generative AI models. This decision marked an important milestone in &lt;STRONG&gt;ethical governance and digital sovereignty&lt;/STRONG&gt;, aligning Brazil with European-style data protection principles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The main sectors driving AI growth in Brazil include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance and digital payments:&lt;/STRONG&gt; automation and predictive analytics;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Energy:&lt;/STRONG&gt; smart grids and real-time system optimization;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agribusiness:&lt;/STRONG&gt; crop forecasting and climate analytics;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Healthcare:&lt;/STRONG&gt; assisted diagnostics and telemedicine;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Public administration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; chatbots and natural language processing for citizen services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;These industries attract investments from both &lt;STRONG&gt;large corporations&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;local startups&lt;/STRONG&gt;, making Brazil a fertile ground for experimentation and innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;About the Outlook for 2025 and Beyond the trends indicate continued expansion of generative AI and process automation in Brazilian companies. &lt;STRONG&gt;By the end of 202&lt;/STRONG&gt;5, it is expected that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Over &lt;STRONG&gt;60% of corporate AI solutions&lt;/STRONG&gt; in Brazil will involve generative models;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The country will consolidate &lt;STRONG&gt;international research and training partnerships&lt;/STRONG&gt;;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;General Artificial Intelligence Law&lt;/STRONG&gt; (under discussion in Congress) will advance the national governance framework.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;With growing public and private investments, Brazil is on track to become a &lt;STRONG&gt;Latin American reference in AI innovation and ethics&lt;/STRONG&gt;, combining &lt;STRONG&gt;economic growth&lt;/STRONG&gt; with &lt;STRONG&gt;responsible technological governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The 2024–2025 period marks a &lt;STRONG&gt;strategic turning point&lt;/STRONG&gt; for AI in Brazil, shifting from an emerging topic to a &lt;STRONG&gt;core pillar of industrial and business competitiveness&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The alignment between &lt;STRONG&gt;government vision&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;international investments&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;technological maturity&lt;/STRONG&gt; positions Brazil as &lt;STRONG&gt;one of the leading AI hubs in the Southern Hemisphere&lt;/STRONG&gt;, with the potential to export technology, talent, and regulatory best practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;At &lt;A class="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/make-value-s-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;MakeValue&lt;/A&gt;, we develop &lt;STRONG&gt;AI-powered applications for SAP Finance&lt;/STRONG&gt;, focused on enhancing financial visibility and decision-making.

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1893645061"&gt;Are you ready to transform your Bill of Exchange processes in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition?&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We’re excited to invite you to participate in the beta testing program for an innovative new capability: &lt;STRONG&gt;AI-Assisted Incoming Bills of Exchange Posting&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shivendra25_0-1762407697899.jpeg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336724i71995855D0EE3227/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Shivendra25_0-1762407697899.jpeg" alt="Shivendra25_0-1762407697899.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This feature, set to be available for early access with the February 14, 2026 release(2602), leverages AI to simplify and streamline the handling of incoming Bills of Exchange (BoE). The current focus is on key regions such as &lt;STRONG&gt;Japan, China, France, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Managing Bills of Exchange can be a time-consuming task that involves extracting and interpreting large amounts of data. This new AI-powered capability aims to make your life easier by automating the extraction, mapping, and posting of BoE information directly within the application. The result: faster processing, reduced errors, and enhanced efficiency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As a beta participant, you’ll have the opportunity to test this feature in your own SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. Your feedback will be invaluable in shaping the future of this tool. We will also organize regular meetings to share updates and collect your insights, ensuring that the tool evolves in a way that truly benefits your business processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1697131556"&gt;Key Dates&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Registration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; October 21, 2025 - January 15, 2026&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Program Start:&lt;/STRONG&gt; February 14, 2026&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Duration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; 90 days&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Seats are limited, so act fast!

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In France we have a legal requirement to submit a file of accounting entries for the closed fiscal year in a dematerialized format (Article L47 A I ) which is effective from 01.01.2014.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Upon receiving request from the tax authorities, a company has 15 days to prepare and submit the FEC file. In case of failing to deliver the FEC file or in the event of non-compliance, companies could face significant penalties&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This file consists of entries after inventory operations, excluding centralization entries and excluding entries for balancing expense and revenue accounts. It includes the entries for the recovery of balances from the previous fiscal year and contains, for each entry, all accounting data present in the company's computerized accounting system, with the first eighteen pieces of information required to correspond, in order, to those listed in the following table:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="mmehanna_0-1762325701323.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336357i53CE5D38CE210C0E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="mmehanna_0-1762325701323.png" alt="mmehanna_0-1762325701323.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further information about the legal requirements can be found here&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000037526053" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Article L47 A - Book of Tax Procedures – &lt;/A&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000037526053" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Légifrance&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000027804775" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Article A47 A-1 - Livre des procédures fiscales - Légifrance&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to generate the FEC file from SAP?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;DRC or DART&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It enables you to create, process, and monitor electronic documents and statutory reports.

You can use DART to extract and store data that is relevant to tax from SAP applications at regular intervals. DART extracts the data into sequential files and provides tools that you can use to display and evaluate the stored data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In general, two steps are required in DART to create machine-readable files for the tax auditor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first step in DART involves generating extract files that capture data based on the selected company code and areas like FI, CO, SD, and MM, with customizable restrictions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the second step, extract files are transformed into view files according to tax auditor specifications by defining which segments are included and how they are combined.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further information can be found here&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ERP/ae5c71ff3b1f490fb7f3b1f17bb2c7ee/6f96c2531bb9b44ce10000000a174cb4.html?version=6.05.latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Introduction to the Data Retention Tool (DART) | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What are the technical prerequisites for FEC solution by DART?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The recommendation from SAP is to be on the highest version of DART with all the latest notes implemented.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;you can check the DART version in the SE11.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You should choose there the "TYPE GROUP": DART1.

These postings represent the balance carryforward but do not generate balances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For these postings, no subledger documents (customer/vendor/Asset Accounting) are written.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No open items are generated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report is available for classic General Ledger Accounting and new General Ledger Accounting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The documents are specially indicated:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1) The document status is 'O' (balance sheet opening entry).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2) The reference transaction is 'GLYEC' (year-end closing document).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3) The documents are posted in period '0' of the carryforward year.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Documents are generated for each account, customer, and vendor. Information about the customer and vendor is stored in the LIFNR/KUNNR fields as well as in the assignment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The balances of the respective balance sheet accounts are cleared against "Balance Sheet Account - Opening" on the selection screen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The posted documents can be reversed with the FI reversal transactions (FB08/F.80).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span

website&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgfip/outil-de-test-des-fichiers-des-ecritures-comptables-fec" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Outil de test

noreferrer"&gt; des Finances et de la Souveraineté industrielle et numérique&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After installation, run the program. The screen is the same as the one used by the authorities. You should fill the field "Entrer le numéro alpage du dossier" with your number as the file naming example ("111222333"). This is mandatory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second field is optional; you can write the name of your company into this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also choose the type of your chart of account on the left column (Type de plan comptable) and the type of the revenue category on the right column (Type de revenus). Then you can upload the file to be tested by clicking on the icon "Selectionner un fichier á traiter".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select the relevant local file. After that your can start the test by clicking on the "Valider" button.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the end of the test, a summary document is generated in PDF format. It is automatically displayed and saved. The first page of the summary contains general information about this validation process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second page shows the mandatory fields required by the law and the fields of the actual FEC file next to it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additional notes and comments about the file are displayed on the third page. Generally, these notes have two types: in some cases, these are problems what should be solved in order to get correct file from technical aspect. For example, if there are missing data, it is displayed under the heading „Données absentes”. There are also informational comments, in these cases the file is technically correct. These are displayed under the heading „Observations complémentaires”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="6"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud for Customer Payments - Transition and Future with APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has transitioned&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud for Customer Payments&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;into maintenance mode and removed it from the price list (as of September 2, 2024). The solution will continue to be supported for existing customers under active contracts, but no further development or investments are made. Customers are encouraged to transition to the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;API-based approach&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and On-Premise/Private Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Accounts receivable processes today are often&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;costly, manual, and time-consuming&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Many businesses face delays in cash collection, lack of transparency for their customers, and high operational costs for invoice and payment handling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Marie_Kretz_0-1760374142920.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/326868iB8BE50814FF881CF/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Marie_Kretz_0-1760374142920.png" alt="Marie_Kretz_0-1760374142920.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP enables customers and partners to build&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;modern customer-facing portals&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;that accelerate the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;invoice-to-cash process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and support&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;automated cash collection&lt;/STRONG&gt;. These portals empower end customers with self-service capabilities, reducing manual workload while improving the customer experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1636489608"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step-by-step guide to cross-system orchestration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Dear finance experts,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In a Central Finance scenario, managing a month-end close across both source ERP and Central Finance systems presents a unique challenge: how do you maintain a single, seamless process and retain transparency over the overall status of your financial close? SAP Advanced Financial Closing (AFC) is the answer.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This guide provides a clear path to managing your financial close across systems. We'll demonstrate how to configure AFC to manage a unified task list, create dependencies between source and central tasks, and gain complete cross-system visibility through AFC’s embedded reporting capabilities.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We’ll be looking at an example where Central Payment is activated for a company code that is managed in AFC. In this case, some closing activities of the AP/AR payment and clearing processes are executed in the Central Finance system, while other activities are still executed in the source system.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;While we’re looking at an example with a single source system here, the same is possible in a landscape with multiple source systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569058822"&gt;Enable Central-Finance-specific reports and apps with SAP Advanced Financial Closing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisite:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/advanced-financial-closing/administration/specify-communication-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Specify communication systems for both source and CFIN system&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;During the entity close in SAP Advanced Financial Closing, you’ll need to add Central-Finance-specific activities like Central Finance comparison reports, manage temporary postings, and so on. To make these tasks available in SAP Advanced Financial Closing, you first need to create task models in the communication system’s local settings. The local settings allow you to define which parameters shall be derived from the task list context while you can specify others directly as part of the program registration of the task model. &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In our example, we'll create two CFIN-specific tasks:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Job task to run the Balance Comparison Report (steps 1 – 5)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fiori app for Manage Temporary Postings (steps 4 – 5)&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Documentation reference:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/advanced-financial-closing/local-settings/abap-programs-in-advanced-financial-closing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ABAP Programs in SAP Advanced Financial Closing&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/advanced-financial-closing/local-settings/sap-fiori-applications-in-advanced-financial-closing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fiori Applications in SAP Advanced Financial Closing&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Register an ABAP program for parameter mapping&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As a first step, you need to register an ABAP program for parameter mapping. This enables you to define parameters and parameter values afterwards, and create a task model for this program.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jana_kasselmann_0-1763716877816.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343494i87366B840682DA9B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jana_kasselmann_0-1763716877816.png" alt="jana_kasselmann_0-1763716877816.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Maintain parameters for the ABAP program you've already registered&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By assigning the FYEAR and FYEPE parameter types to the respective parameters, we ensure that the fiscal year and posting period are derived automatically from the context of the task list in which the task will be used.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For CFIN-specific tasks, however, parameters like Company Code or G/L Account often refer to source system values. To ensure the correct source value is used, we &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;do not&lt;SPAN&gt; set these parameters to be derived from the task list context, hence no parameter type is assigned here.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jana_kasselmann_1-1763716877817.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343497iE6055185DA8497EB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jana_kasselmann_1-1763716877817.png" alt="jana_kasselmann_1-1763716877817.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Define fixed values or value ranges for specific parameters&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Next, we define some parameter values for the balance comparison report directly in the task model, so they will be applied wherever the task model is used.

Then, we can generate the task list for a specific period and test how our central finance tasks are processed and represented in the embedded reporting.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Documentation reference:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/advanced-financial-closing/user/how-to-generate-and-release-task-lists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How to Generate and Release Task Lists&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Open the task list template.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;On the template’s header, choose “Generate Task List”.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Provide the closing key date, fiscal year, and period.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Choose “Release Task List”.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let’s have a look at the resulting task list.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigate to the “Task Lists” tab.
