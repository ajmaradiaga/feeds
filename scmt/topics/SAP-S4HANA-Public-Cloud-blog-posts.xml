    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;Hey SAP Beginners! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":waving_hand:"&gt;👋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Happy Early July 4th weekend. I'm hoping some of you caught our SAP Learning Insights podcast episode that dropped today - I had the pleasure of being interviewed by David Chaviano about my journey from fifth-grade teacher to running a global SAP training organization! We talked about how I discovered SAP through a 2021 pro bono program and supported the Digital Skills Initiative, which has now enrolled over 1,500 SAP learners across 27 countries. If you missed it, definitely worth a listen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What we've been up to lately:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Developed a beginner-friendly approach to SAP fundamentals&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Created hands-on learning paths that mirror real workplace scenarios&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Built a supportive community where "no question is too basic" is our motto&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integrated the new SAP Student Learning System into our bootcamps - the Intro to Business certification is absolutely hot right now and our learners are loving it! &lt;A title="Positioning SAP Business Suite for Students" href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/positioning-sap-business-suite-for-students?userlogin=true" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Please check it out. HERE&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;I'm here because I believe everyone deserves a clear path into SAP, regardless of their technical background. Whether you're switching careers, a fresh graduate, or just SAP-curious, this community is gold for getting started.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Looking forward to learning alongside you all and sharing what I've picked up along the way. Feel free to DM me if you're stuck on something or want to learn more about our approach - we're all figuring this out together!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;What was your biggest "aha moment" when you started learning SAP?&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud: Enabling Scalable Growth for Mid-Sized Companies&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Ambarish_ad_0-1749471765743.png" style="width: 920px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/271741i3D7448F7CFF9B42B/image-dimensions/920x524?v=v2" width="920" height="524" role="button" title="Ambarish_ad_0-1749471765743.png" alt="Ambarish_ad_0-1749471765743.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In highly competitive market, these days the impact of mid-sized companies is hard to miss; they’ve learned to position themselves in a crowded market. To succeed, they stay quick, dream up fresh ideas, chase growth and yet still juggle limited money, shifting customer demands and rules from many regulation authorities. That is where SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud steps in - a strong, public-cloud answer that scales on command, speeds up innovation, offers enterprise-grade tools and cuts out most of the usual IT headaches.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scaling Smart: Navigating Growth Challenges in the Mid-Market Sector&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Mid-sized companies find themselves compressed between the big companies and the start-ups. Like the big players, they do not enjoy huge IT teams or expensive resources for year-long tech rollouts, yet their day-to-day headaches are just as trapped. Running operations in multiple countries, adjusting several product lines, keeping up with shifting rules, and pushing ahead with digital change all demand solid tools and budget. After all these conflicts, keeping companies balance sheet in shiny condition is not that easy. If they hang on to that aging ERP or a patchwork of outdated apps and systems, the drag can swallow momentum, showing up as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Extra stress in meeting tough compliance standards&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Focus shift from priorities to non-priorities activities, hurdles that block entry into fresh markets or regions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Isolation that keep departments talking past each other&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On-premises systems that pile up hidden total cost of ownership&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Rigid procedures with little automation and avoiding changes which will keep away from latest and cost-effective solution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud product is all about?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;With pre-configured best practices, SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is a scalable, cloud-based ERP solution that optimises business operations. Through the Central Business Configuration tool, it facilitates industry-specific configurations, minimal customisation, and quick deployment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Continuous innovation, real-time insights, and sustainability tracking are made possible by its integrated AI, machine learning, and tools such as Signavio and SAP Analytics Cloud. Flexibility and compatibility are guaranteed by a smooth integration with both SAP and non-SAP systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is a future-ready ERP platform that offers agility, innovation, and sustainability, making it the perfect choice for organisations looking to modernise. Below are the key features of SAP Public cloud,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Now, let’s see how all mentioned features can drive scalable growth for small and mid-sized companies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Total cost of owner ship &amp;amp; Cost Effectiveness &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Consider infrastructure upgrades, continuous system maintenance, specialised IT support, and those annoying manual updates. Traditional ERP systems can have some unforeseen costs. SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, on the other hand, adopts a different strategy with its subscription-based model, allowing you to benefit from predictable operational expenses and a significantly reduced total cost of ownership (TCO).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Here are a few benefits:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You avoid the headache of project-based upgrades and receive constant innovations and updates.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No requirement for sizable IT staffs or substantial physical infrastructure&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Backups, disaster recovery, and cybersecurity are all integrated into SAP's secure data centres.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Mid-sized businesses can now more easily access and afford enterprise-grade ERP capabilities thanks to this model. By using SAP public cloud,&lt;STRONG&gt; companies can save around 50% of implementation cost.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Accelerated ROI through faster deployment and adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Businesses can quickly and efficiently implement SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud thanks to the SAP Activate methodology and SAP ALM. Implementation time is greatly reduced, frequently going live in 12 to 16 weeks (For less complex business), thanks to predefined business processes, guided configuration tools, and automated testing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This type of flexibility enables mid-sized businesses to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Avoid long project cycles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduce the cost of implementation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reallocate internal resources to strategic business objectives.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;See a return on investment almost immediately. Additionally, SAP provides pre-configured industry content (such as for professional services, manufacturing, and wholesale distribution), which enables businesses to more quickly align with the demands of their particular sector.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;I have seen often small and mid-size industries facing lot of challenges with resources and budget, SAP Public cloud solution can be real game changer for these companies. By using SAP public cloud companies can save around 60% of their time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Public cloud package – &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;As per my experience, it will be always beneficial to business if they consider SAP cloud ERP as a package. It often includes ALM (Application lifecycle management), BTP (Business technology platform) and other services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Advantages of the packages,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pay as you go model&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cost effective&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Bundled value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Quick time to value&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Innovation Ready&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For few products no separate licencing is required&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Continuous Innovation, Delivered Quarterly&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Thanks to automatic quarterly updates, SAP keeps your experience fresh and evolving bringing you new features, smarter tools, and meaningful enhancements like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Keeping pace with changes in national laws and regulations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Refining processes and boosting overall performance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enhancing intelligence and user experience through AI and machine learning&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In todays competitive market business should focus on their priorities, it will be very dangerous for business to involved in unproductive or less productive area, especially it can be big hurdle for mid-size companies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;With Public cloud business can be competitive and flexible with enjoying access to newest product features available to them without any extra efforts on expansive upgrades and dip pre-launch testing. SAP will take care of all upgrade process on the behalf of companies so there will be very less chance of errors and failures.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Flexible, Future-Proof Scalability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is thoughtfully built to grow with your business — scaling effortlessly in every direction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Companies can improve their systems by adding new functionalities as their needs evolve over a period of time, such as Integrated Order-to-Cash and Procure-to-Pay, Advanced Financial Planning &amp;amp; Analysis or subscription billing and real time data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On other side once business expectation fulfilled they can use the same global template to expand into new business units, regions, or subsidiaries.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Since it’s built for the cloud from the ground up, businesses can easily scale without pouring money into new hardware. That makes it perfect for companies planning to grow internationally or handle mergers and acquisitions. Even mid-sized firms can tap into the public cloud to reach their goals faster and more affordably.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Built-in intelligent technology solutions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Intelligent technologies that improve decision-making, simplify daily tasks, and optimise business processes abound in the public cloud:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Even with smaller teams, these features enable mid-sized businesses to function more effectively working smarter, not harder. To be more precise, business can also take advantages of Joule for reporting or taking accurate data from system is fraction of second.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Global Compliance with Local Precision&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Localisations for more than 40 countries are pre-installed in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud and include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Handling all necessary documentation and compliance filings as per local requirements.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Meeting country-specific tax and legal obligations, including e-invoicing, GST, and VAT.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Providing financial reporting structures and customized charts of accounts suited to local standards.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;With all specific local features business can enter in the market with confidence as SAP has already taken all the headache and incorporated all region-specific issues in advanced in the SAP product, so business can concentrate on other important aspect which is important for business growth.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Collaborative Framework for Functional Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud eliminates data silos and produces a unified picture of the company by integrating finance, supply chain, procurement, HR, and sales onto a single platform. Integrated analytics and dashboards provide decision-makers with real-time insights, such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Analysis of profitability by product, region, or customer&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Current stock levels in every warehouse&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Different pre-defined KPIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Better decision-making, faster reactions, and more strategic growth planning are made possible by this instant visibility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary: &amp;nbsp;Impact on mid-size businesses &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA is a game-changer for mid-sized businesses, acting as a powerful catalyst for growth and innovation that goes well beyond just being a cloud-based ERP. The goal of SAP cloud ERP is to transition all mid-sized businesses to the cloud, allowing them to experience significant improvements by leveraging all the features and technologies available for their growth.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In summary, considering all these points, we can confidently say that SAP cloud ERP is a key driver of success. It supports businesses in various ways, including strategy, value, cost management, innovation, and fostering genuine growth.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud isn’t just a tool for businesses aiming to expand without the usual headaches; it’s a true partner in growth.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This blog post introduces a recent enhancement in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition that significantly improves developer extensibility for the Document and Reporting Compliance solution in Türkiye&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This change enables developers to fully utilize the SET_OUTPUT_DATA method in the EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD BAdI,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; which is used to modify the XML files generated for an electronic document.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In some scenarios, you would want to enhance the standard XML file generated for an electronic document &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;- for example, to add optional fields or make changes based on specific business or legal requirements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; The Document and Reporting Compliance framework provides the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SET_OUTPUT_DATA &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;method within the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD BAdI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;to support such enhancements. This method allows partners to tailor the generated XML output to meet their needs. This was possible in &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;; however, it was not available in &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, which limited flexibility for partners using the public cloud edition.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;However, until now, a key limitation with the Document and Reporting Compliance Türkiye solution was that its service consumer structures were not released. As a result, accessing and modifying XML content through ABAP structures was not straightforward. These structures needed to be made available by SAP for the respective country to enable developer extensibility. Without them, enhancements through the BAdI were either restricted or not feasible.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s New?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To remove this limitation, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP has now released all proxy objects for the Türkiye Document and Reporting Compliance solution&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. As a result, developers can fully utilize the SET_OUTPUT_DATA method and enhance the XML output using standard proxy structures without any restrictions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You must have configured developer extensibility role in your configuration environment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The required business role is &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP_BR_DEVELOPER&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implementation Steps in ABAP Development Tools (ADT):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In your ABAP project, go to the enhancement spot ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD (path: package GLO-EDO &amp;gt; Enhancements &amp;gt; Enhancement Spots).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Right-click ES_EDOCUMENT_CLOUD and select New&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; BAdI Enhancement Implementation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enter a package, name, and description.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose Add BAdI Implementation and select for EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create a BAdI filter for Country (TR) and/or Generic Filter.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose Implementing Class to create a new implementation class. The new implementation class automatically implements the interfaces "if_badi_interfaces" and "if_edoc_adaptor_cloud".&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After generating the class, open the interface method and press F3 to view its parameters. To display the documentation, press F2.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Activate your BAdI implementation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Ria_Gupta_19-1752513145673.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/286491i1A48D7F8CEF84FC1/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Ria_Gupta_19-1752513145673.png" alt="Ria_Gupta_19-1752513145673.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example Implementation:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To better illustrate how this enhancement can be used, we’ll walk through two examples, one for a &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Türkiye&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Basic eInvoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and another for a &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Delivery Note&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Example 1:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Türkiye&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Basic eInvoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this example, we demonstrate how to enhance the XML output using the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SET_OUTPUT_DATA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; method:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We populate the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;lt;PaymentMeansCode&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; XML tag with a custom value.

The necessary structures are now fully available for use within the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SET_OUTPUT_DATA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; method of the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EDOC_ADAPTOR_CLOUD&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; BAdI. This allows developers to add or adjust XML elements and populate optional fields based on specific business or legal requirements, without facing previous limitations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This improvement gives you more flexibility and helps ensure compliance with &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Türkiye&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;’s legal requirements. It also speeds up development, as you no longer need to wait for SAP to release specific proxy objects.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Important Information About Converting Renumbered G/L Accounts with an Active Parallel Line:</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We've recently gotten some feedback regarding a specific point in the conversion process for renumbered G/L accounts and wanted to take a quick minute to spread the word as widely as possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you're converting renumbered G/L accounts on a three-system landscape, that conversion process means a development system downtime (typically 2-4 hours). During this downtime, your business users can't access the SAP Fiori launchpad, so day-to-day business in the development system is blocked for that period of time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So far, so good. But what if you have an active parallel line?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In that case, the conversion process means a downtime for&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;both&lt;/EM&gt; development systems at the same time. It doesn't matter whether or not the accounts were branched (from the main line to the parallel line, or vice versa) or whether they exist in one line only: Converting renumbered G/L accounts in&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;either&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; the main line&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;or&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; the parallel line means a downtime for the development system across both lines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please keep this in mind when you're scheduling the conversion process for your renumbered G/L accounts!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As always, further information can be found on the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0fa84c9d9c634132b7c4abb9ffdd8f06/3f26dcad088041d1be18b95e361af48e.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And of course, if you have follow-up questions here, or want to know more about the renumbering process for your G/L accounts, feel free to ask in the comments--we can answer or make new posts to clarify additional issues that arise!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;在当今节奏快速的商业环境中，精准高效管理数据已成为企业的核心需求。对于使用SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition的企业而言，防止业务伙伴数据的重复录入不仅关乎数据完整性，更直接影响运营效率。本文将为您详细讲解一套关键的重复性检查机制，确保您的客户和供应商信息始终唯一、无误。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1864090346"&gt;为什么你需要关注这个&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;重复数据不仅带来管理上的麻烦，还可能引发运营效率降低甚至合规问题。通过确保业务伙伴的每条信息都唯一，从源头降低风险，可以增强记录的可靠性。SAP S/4HANA Cloud提供了简便的流程来实现这一目标，本文将一步步指导你开启这项高效的自动重复检测。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1796659560"&gt;小贴士&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;- &lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;强烈建议在 Starter 或 TDD 系统中&lt;/FONT&gt;确认规则的效果。&lt;BR /&gt;- 定期回顾和优化匹配规则，确保适应业务变化。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1471063336"&gt;关键步骤总览&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;- 下载必需的CBC/SSCUI配置步骤清单以识别所需权限，确认你在系统中具有相应权限&lt;BR /&gt;- 从CBC系统中找到配置步骤，进入重复检查配置页面&lt;BR /&gt;- 根据业务需要设定规则优先级和筛选条件&lt;BR /&gt;- 启用并保存设置，让系统自动执行检查&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1274549831"&gt;详细操作指南&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1207119045"&gt;1. 获取权限&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;在配置重复性检查之前，参考以下步骤，确保自己拥有足够的权限。&lt;BR /&gt;- 登录SAP For Me，在顶部搜索栏中打开“SAP Signavio Process Navigator”。&lt;BR /&gt;- 找到“Implementation”标签下的“Accelerators（加速器）”区域，下载“Configuration apps”中的Excel清单（示意图1）。&lt;BR /&gt;- 查阅Excel文档，确认所需的CBC/SSCUI ID（如100274）和Business Catalog ID。&lt;BR /&gt;- 在系统中打开“Business Catalog”应用，找到相应的“Business Role”，为自己分配相应权限角色（示意图2）。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

配置重复检查【操作步骤】&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;- 进入配置界面：使用CBC/SSCUI ID（如100274）搜索“Configure Matching and Duplication Check”（示意图3）。&lt;BR /&gt;- 创建新配置：在“Manage Match Configurations”界面，点击“Add Configuration”按钮（示意图4-5），命名如“T_NUM_D”，描述为“税号重复检查”。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

设定匹配类型：完全匹配、部分匹配或模糊匹配（示意图6）。&lt;BR /&gt;- 设定规则优先级和筛选条件：比如优先级：税号 &amp;gt; 业务名称。&lt;BR /&gt;- 筛选范围：可以设置只检查特定客户类型或地区。&lt;BR /&gt;- 设置为默认规则：确保此规则自动应用于所有新建或更新的业务伙伴。&lt;BR /&gt;- 保存配置：确认无误后，点击“Save”完成设置。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline"

left;"&gt;为了检验，我们跳转去管理业务伙伴的应用。在创建新的业务伙伴时，如果输入重复的信息，您将看到类似的报错消息。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

left;"&gt;SAP当前更推荐使用Fiori应用来管理业务流程。Fiori提供了更现代化、更易于使用的界面，大多数业务功能已经在Fiori中得到增强和优化。不过，为了提供更全面的支持，以下内容展示了如何通过WebGUI进行激活的相关步骤，这可以作为理解旧版流程的参考。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;激活重复检查：进入配置界面，使用CBC/SSCUI配置步骤102415以激活税号类别重复检查。在维护税号类别应用中，将需要检查的税号更改为“开”（示意图8）。&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Y_Lou_1-1752558525780.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In this short blog post, I would like to demonstrate how to use fields with codelist values in a Custom Business Object. For an overall introduction on how to setup the CBO, please refer to my previous &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/api-operations-for-custom-business-objects-in-s-4hana-cloud/ba-p/13552628" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt; on the topic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the app “&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Reusable Elements&lt;/STRONG&gt;”, under the section “Custom Code Lists”, create a new custom code list. Enter the code values along with their respective description:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="varunvenkat_0-1752768056098.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288019i9382C6C915BA553D/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="varunvenkat_0-1752768056098.png" alt="varunvenkat_0-1752768056098.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="varunvenkat_1-1752768056112.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288021i84C565EF1DFF07B2/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="varunvenkat_1-1752768056112.png" alt="varunvenkat_1-1752768056112.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the CBO is created as per your needs, choose the type codelist for your desired field. In the codelist value, you can select the codelist created in the previous step:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="varunvenkat_2-1752768056120.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288020iB6ABDAC4116B4D99/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="varunvenkat_2-1752768056120.png" alt="varunvenkat_2-1752768056120.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Publish the CBO, and finally in the generated UI of the CBO, you can select the codelist values for your field as required:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="varunvenkat_3-1752768056128.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288022i3ECEAA6888A4513A/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="varunvenkat_3-1752768056128.png" alt="varunvenkat_3-1752768056128.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1864150860"&gt;Business Requirement&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Company &lt;STRONG&gt;X&lt;/STRONG&gt; wants to calculate the production cost based on the variant selected when placing an order for a product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before Company &lt;STRONG&gt;X&lt;/STRONG&gt; can quote a price to its customer, it would like to know the correct cost to achieve the right profit margin. The cost calculation should occur as soon as the order is received, and well before actual production begins.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Company &lt;STRONG&gt;X&lt;/STRONG&gt; applies a multiplier to the standard cost of operations, which varies depending on the product's configuration.&amp;nbsp;They want to execute the process in their SAP Cloud ERP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution at high level&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This solution will focus on calculating the production cost based on the configuration and making it visible at the sales order. It doesn't deal with sales order processes as a whole.&lt;BR /&gt;The multiplier that Company X uses is created as a custom field (called YY1_price_factor) in Production Routing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Steps in the Solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="#section1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Creating Custom Field &lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="#section2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Setting Up Configurable Material&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="#section3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Integrating Workcenter Formula&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="#section4" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Setting Object Dependency and Characteristics&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="#section5" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Executing Business Processes&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="section1" id="toc-hId-1538554636"&gt;Creating Custom Fields&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Company X uses a custom field, &lt;STRONG&gt;YY1_price_factor&lt;/STRONG&gt;, within Production Routing. This field is set up using the Key User Extensibility's Custom Field App, under the Business Context: &lt;STRONG&gt;Manufacturing Bill of Operations Operation&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The custom field is crucial for linking production routing operations to sales orders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;a.

Changes in configuration, such as altering the counterweight from &lt;STRONG&gt;2,000 kg&lt;/STRONG&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;5,000 kg&lt;/STRONG&gt;, dynamically adjust the costing and profit margin.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;a. Set the counterweight to 2,000 kg in Variant Configuration.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="VC2Kg.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288034iD50EB8D5AA980C8C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="VC2Kg.png" alt="VC2Kg.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The profit margin is calculated for 2,000 kgs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This solution focuses on calculating the production cost based on the configuration and displaying it on the sales order. It doesn't deal with sales order processes as a whole. The multiplier that Company X uses is created as a custom field (called YY1_price_factor) in Production Routing.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Price2KG.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288035i5EB78B01B356F221/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Price2KG.png" alt="Price2KG.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;b. Set the counterweight to 5,000 kgs in Variant Configuration.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="VC5Kg.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288038iA6363E40772BD7A8/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="VC5Kg.png" alt="VC5Kg.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The profit margin is calculated for 5,000 kgs.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="profitMargin5kg.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288055i0F8B7FB02701AC29/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="profitMargin5kg.png" alt="profitMargin5kg.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Production Order Impact&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In production orders, the custom field &lt;STRONG&gt;price_factor&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;reflects changes in sales order configurations. For instance, changing the counterweight from 2,000 kg to 5,000 kg adjusts the &lt;STRONG&gt;price_factor&lt;/STRONG&gt; from &lt;STRONG&gt;2&lt;/STRONG&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;5&lt;/STRONG&gt;, demonstrating the direct impact of configuration changes on production costs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;a. Search for the material &lt;STRONG&gt;CM-MLFL-KM-VXX&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Material Coverage&lt;/STRONG&gt; app.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="PO1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287573i41CAD77D2A305227/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PO1.png" alt="PO1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;b. Choose &lt;STRONG&gt;Start MRP Run&lt;/STRONG&gt; to create a planned order.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="PO2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287574iD4BE33E295A68A9A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PO2.png" alt="PO2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;c. Convert the planned order to a production order. Once the production order is created, check the User Field &lt;STRONG&gt;price_factor&lt;/STRONG&gt; in Operations. For counterweight &lt;STRONG&gt;2,000 KG&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the &lt;STRONG&gt;price_factor&lt;/STRONG&gt; is &lt;STRONG&gt;2&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="PO3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287576i94CEC8FF392D30A7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PO3.png" alt="PO3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;d. Now, if this counterweight is changed in the sales order variant config to &lt;STRONG&gt;5,000 KG&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and the MRP run happens again to create the production order in the same way as described above. The &lt;STRONG&gt;price_factor&lt;/STRONG&gt; changes to &lt;STRONG&gt;5&lt;/STRONG&gt; as shown below.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="PO4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287577i446E99E315E5263F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PO4.png" alt="PO4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By integrating custom fields and formulas, Company X provides a streamlined approach to managing production costs, enhancing visibility and accuracy in sales orders and production processes. This solution empowers businesses to make informed decisions and optimize their operations.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the first half of 2025, global sustainability governance has entered a new phase of scrutiny and recalibration. The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EU Omnibus amendments&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to the CSRD have postponed timelines and reduced the scope of immediate obligations for thousands of companies, temporarily easing the pressure of compliance. However, this regulatory pause has only sharpened the spotlight on &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;data integrity, preparedness, and strategic ESG integration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At the same time, investors, regulators, and civil society are intensifying their expectations. Public disclosures are no longer judged on completeness alone—they must be audit-ready, aligned with recognized frameworks like &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ESRS and EU Taxonomy&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. Companies are expected to move beyond box-ticking compliance into continuous ESG performance management, proactively steering their sustainability journey.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Sustainability Control Tower (SCT) is designed precisely for this challenge. It enables organizations to:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Record ESG factors&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; with out-of-the-box integration to SAP systems and trusted third-party sources&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Analyze performance across financial, operational, and sustainability dimensions to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;support informed decisions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accelerate the transition&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; through auditable, framework-aligned reporting—covering both regulatory and voluntary disclosures, powered by AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Building on our momentum from Q1, this quarter's updates focus on strengthening &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ESRS-aligned metric coverage,&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;deeper analytical flexibility, improved auditability, and tighter alignment with financial structures.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Expansion of SAP-provided metric coverage&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To support organizations on their ESRS compliance journey, SAP Sustainability Control Tower (SCT) continues to expand its library of SAP-provided metrics aligned with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards. These include both qualitative and quantitative definitions based on EFRAG's implementation guidance. Current metric coverage is available in the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUS_SCT/21ecfb83f8d14e5982b7af315da5889a/3904fa967d1f4c3d928d2e719141b016.html#overview-of-available-quantitative-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and detailed in the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sustainability-control-tower-update-on-sap-provided-metrics-on-esrs/ba-p/14066241" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Community blog&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, offering transparency and reuse for accelerated implementation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="amandamasuku_0-1753099835434.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289334i3C27CCE536A97C2B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="amandamasuku_0-1753099835434.png" alt="amandamasuku_0-1753099835434.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Looking ahead, we plan to reach approximately 80% coverage of ESRS data points by the end of 2025, including metrics from ESRS 2, S2–S4, G1, and additional quantitative metrics from ESRS Topical Standards. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73555000100800003523&amp;amp;range=CURRENT-LAST#;INNO=B9314318771A1FD083C58B214E869B7A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This roadmap&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; aims to enable our customers to progressively adopt SCT content for structured, auditable, and regulation-ready ESG disclosures while maintaining flexibility to extend for sector-specific or company-specific needs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Analyze ESG Data App Enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Analyze ESG Data application now offers a significantly improved analytics experience with the introduction of the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Analytics &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;tab. Users can explore all standard custom quantitative metrics in greater depth by applying drill-down dimensions, choosing between chart or table formats, and configuring default views tailored to reporting needs. This new flexibility allows up to three charts to be displayed simultaneously, each with independent metric, period, and structure settings.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="amandamasuku_1-1753099835435.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289335i98326E671E0F1C07/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="amandamasuku_1-1753099835435.png" alt="amandamasuku_1-1753099835435.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In parallel, users can manage and switch between saved configurations of grouped metric tiles (“Overviews”), enabling different perspectives for different stakeholders or strategic priorities. Together, these enhancements empower users to personalize and streamline how ESG data is analyzed, viewed, and shared – supporting more informed decision-making and stronger alignment with sustainability goals.

For each component, a content preview is available to ensure alignment with the selected reporting period. Once finalized, templates can be saved and reused, enabling consistent and structured ESG reporting across time periods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="amandamasuku_3-1753099835437.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289336i9B481D7C3E718CA8/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="amandamasuku_3-1753099835437.png" alt="amandamasuku_3-1753099835437.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When generating a report, you can preview or download the result as a PDF—and for added customization, you can edit any section manually. SAP's built-in &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-assistance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; now supports dynamic revisions: simply select a passage and use the “Revise” option to receive suggestions to shorten or lengthen the text, helping refine your final ESG narrative with ease and speed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="amandamasuku_4-1753099835438.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289337iEFEFC62B1880A8D4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="amandamasuku_4-1753099835438.png" alt="amandamasuku_4-1753099835438.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fiscal Period Support&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The new &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage Fiscal Year Variants &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;app brings flexible fiscal period support to SAP Sustainability Control Tower, allowing customers to define and activate custom fiscal year variants that align with their internal planning cycles. Whether using standard calendar months or granular date-based periods (like semi-monthly ranges), organizations can now tailor their ESG data analysis and reporting across key apps such as &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Analyze ESG Data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage GHG Data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;View Emission Dashboard&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. Built-in validation checks help ensure data compatibility, with options to consolidate or reimport data when switching to a new variant. This enables more accurate reporting, tighter alignment with financial periods, and greater control over how sustainability data is structured and interpreted across the organization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Change log updates&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In Q2, we've significantly improved transparency and traceability across SAP Sustainability Control Tower (SCT). Users can now track create, update, and delete changes to public overview configurations in the Analyze ESG Data app using the View Change Logs app. This functionality extends further, providing detailed logs for changes in business activity data, clearly showing the number of updated or imported records and distinguishing between actual and target data.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New Languages Supported&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To better serve global enterprises, SAP SCT now supports Turkish and Italian languages. This update enables local teams to work in their native languages and enhances cross-regional collaboration on sustainability data collection and reporting.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="amandamasuku_5-1753099835439.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289338i5D383DA4EFA5B80C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="amandamasuku_5-1753099835439.png" alt="amandamasuku_5-1753099835439.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;H2 2025 Roadmap Updates&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Looking ahead, we’re focused on simplifying and harmonizing ESG data consumption and reporting. A key milestone will be the delivery of a unified &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Read API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for metric values – supporting both quantitative and qualitative data – to&amp;nbsp; make calculated ESG metrics easily accessible to external tools like disclosure management platforms. This API will also expose key metadata (including ESG standard references) and allow for both bulk and individual metric retrieval based on reporting scopes. We’re also working on improving flexibility in data modeling by enabling &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;custom account groups&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, account-to-group mappings, and supporting activity data input through multiple channels. Additionally, we’ll continue expanding &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;metric-level analysis&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;measure drilldowns&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, and export formats in the Analyze ESG data application. To enhance data quality and reporting alignment, we’re introducing tools for guiding data requirements based on double materiality, setting up reporting hierarchies and data sources, and improving transparency on data completeness. In parallel, we aim to deliver ESRS-aligned metric definitions that cover up to 70% of EFRAG's guidance, along with clear documentation and community updates to keep you informed as mentioned above. Stay tuned: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73555000100800003523&amp;amp;range=CURRENT-LAST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SCT Roadmap Explorer.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Additional Information&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For in-depth details on SAP Sustainability Control Tower, we recommend browsing the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUS_SCT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Help Portal&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

It is now prominently located at the top of the shell bar, enabling users to access the navigation menu swiftly and efficiently.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before and After:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;/SPAN&gt;The navigation menu was designed to support the personalization of spaces.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;/SPAN&gt;The functionality has been enhanced, and the navigation menu now offers seamless access to navigation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;Additionally, for SAP S/4 HANA Public Cloud and SAP BTP ABAP environment the shell bar now supports displaying the product name alongside the company or brand logo. Administrators can manage and translate the product name using the WINDOW_TITLE_EXTENSION parameter located in the Manage Launchpad Settings app, &lt;SPAN&gt;e.g. refer to &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/4fc8d03390c342da8a60f8ee387bca1a/22d573aead754b80abca18ec71872fb7.html?version=2508.500&amp;amp;state=DRAFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Launchpad Settings | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt; for SAP S/4 HANA Public Cloud Edition.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before and After:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;:&amp;nbsp;The product name could not be included in the shell bar.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;After&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&amp;nbsp;The product name is now configurable and can be displayed in the shell bar next to the company or brand logo. Likewise, the browser window title, the product name next to the logo and the app title are now synchronized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Aparna_N_0-1753105307663.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289406i59628F908E82E8CA/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Aparna_N_0-1753105307663.png" alt="Aparna_N_0-1753105307663.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-948922765"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigation menu&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Side navigation menu.gif" style="width: 911px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289458i2D1B6C8495876DE2/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Side navigation menu.gif" alt="Side navigation menu.gif" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The navigation can now be accessed using the navigation menu. If the My Home space is configured, you will see the &lt;STRONG&gt;Favorites Apps&lt;/STRONG&gt; section&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; .(For SAP S/4HANA My Home space is in sync &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;with the Favorites).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Following this, you'll find the &lt;STRONG&gt;My Spaces&lt;/STRONG&gt; section. In this section, you can view all your personalized spaces and pages.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If the SPACES_NAVIGATION_BAR_PERSONALIZATION setting is enabled in the Manage Launchpad Settings app, you'll see the &lt;STRONG&gt;All Spaces&lt;/STRONG&gt; option, which allows for personalization of spaces (pinning and unpinning spaces).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before and After:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; The navigation menu had a different position in the shell bar, providing options for personalizing spaces.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; The most significant advantage of the navigation is that it allows you to directly access entries from within any application, eliminating the need to return to the home page first.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-752409260"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;User Menu&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Aparna_N_0-1753102557001.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289370iBBDA6689C417E2A4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Aparna_N_0-1753102557001.png" alt="Aparna_N_0-1753102557001.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The user menu &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;has been updated from a simple popover with a list to a more visually appealing design.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;The entries have been reordered according to new UXC guidelines, placing ‘Settings’ at the top. The menu now can display an avatar, user's ID or the e-mail address depending on configuration options in the different products or platforms. Previously, the sign-out option was a standard list item located at the end of the list. It has now been relocated to the footer of the user menu.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before and After:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: The user menu previously was a basic list items menu.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: The user menu has been redesigned to provide a more intuitive user experience. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-555895755"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Notifications&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Notification.gif" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289464iD6EA6D68FCCFD6CD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Notification.gif" alt="Notification.gif" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Earlier, notifications could be grouped by Date, Type, and Priority. Considering recent usage data that indicated minimal use of the "By Type" option, the UI has been simplified by eliminating this grouping. Notifications can now be sorted using a sort of button, with options to arrange them by date or by importance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Moreover, while in the notifications view, users can easily navigate to notification settings in the user menu by using the Settings icon in the upper-right corner.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before and After:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Previously, notifications were grouped by Date, Type, or Priority.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;:&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;Notifications are now organized by date or importance, with direct access to settings via the Settings&amp;nbsp; ic&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;on.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Conclusion&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the adoption of the latest SAP Design System we strive to empower users to navigate and use SAP applications with greater ease and efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Transport Management in SAP Cloud ERP 3SL Architecture During Upgrades</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP Cloud ERP's 3-system landscape (3SL) architecture, transport management becomes particularly complex during release upgrades. This Blogpost provides comprehensive guidance on managing transports when systems are at different release levels, addressing common challenges and best practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Understanding the 3SL Upgrade Timeline&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the standard three-system landscape, the test system is upgraded three weeks before the development and production systems during each release cycle. This approach provides sufficient time for regression testing before upgrading the remaining systems&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transport Types in SAP Cloud ERP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before examining specific scenarios, it's essential to understand the three primary transport types:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customizing Transports&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Generated because of Configuration changes via Central Business Configuration or Implementation activities Application.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Developer Extensibility Transports&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Created when any kind of ABAP developers extensions created generally via ABAP development tool.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key User Extensibility Transports&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Created as a result of Key user extensions for example Custom field and logic, Custom business objects etc.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transport Management Scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario 1: Uniform Release Level (N-N-N)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When development, test, and production systems operate at the same release level, transport management follows the standard process:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Export all transport types from the development system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Import transports into the test system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Forward transports to the production system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Complete the process by importing into the production system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario 2: Mixed Release Levels (N-N+1-N)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This scenario occurs during the upgrade window when the test system operates at a higher release level than development and production systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;For Customizing and Developer Extensibility Transports&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The standard transport process from Scenario 1 remains applicable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;For Key User Extensibility Transports&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Certain objects face import restrictions into higher release systems. For example, SAP Fiori Launchpad Pages (UIPC) during 2502 release (reference: &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3560509/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3560509 - SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2502 in a 3-system landscape: Release Restriction Note - SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transports which contain these kinds of objects are shown as outdated. And we have two options for managing them:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Option A: Forward Without Import&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Forward the transport from the test system without importing it, and then import it into the productive system&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Option B: Re-export After Alignment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After all systems have been upgraded to the same level, you have to re-export the same content again from the development system and transport to test and production system, so as to ensure that the key user extensibility is also in the test system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for reading this blog post, hopefully, the blog post was informative and helped you to understand in detail how to&amp;nbsp;manage Transports during upgrade.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: You can't import a transport created on release n into release n+2 and higher, which means that you have to recreate the transport in the development system. However, it is not possible to recreate CBC transports. In this case, you have to create a support incident.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: To identify the objects not supported for N,N+1 Transports For 2508 Release, Please read the Release Note that generally released 2 Weeks before the T system upgrade.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1993377664"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is Project Settlement?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Settlement is the process of transferring costs incurred on a project to a final receiver such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;an asset under construction&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;a completed fixed asset&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;or a cost object (e.g. cost center)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the context of capital investment projects, this ensures the capital expenditures (CapEx) are properly posted to the balance sheet instead of the P&amp;amp;L.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To start with a simplified view, we can split the complete process into two parts:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BirgitOe_0-1753260490135.png" style="width: 564px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290193i5063E486D1061373/image-dimensions/564x112?v=v2" width="564" height="112" role="button" title="BirgitOe_0-1753260490135.png" alt="BirgitOe_0-1753260490135.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Asset Creation Phase&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;settlement moves costs from the &lt;STRONG&gt;investment project&lt;/STRONG&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;asset(s) under construction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;this can be done via &lt;STRONG&gt;periodic &lt;/STRONG&gt;settlement at the close of the period or &lt;STRONG&gt;event-based&lt;/STRONG&gt; with every posting to the investment project&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Final Asset available to be used&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;settlement moves balance sheet values from &lt;STRONG&gt;asset(s) under construction&lt;/STRONG&gt; to&lt;STRONG&gt; final asset&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;values that cannot be capitalised can be moved to other cost objects, e.g. cost centers&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;this is done via &lt;STRONG&gt;periodic&lt;/STRONG&gt; settlement at the close of the period&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1796864159"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Master Data Involved&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Investment Projects &lt;/STRONG&gt;are used primarily for planning and monitoring capital investments that are not capitalised directly, due to their scope or the large percentage of in-house production involved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All expenditures related to the investment project are tracked separately to differentiate them from regular operational costs.&lt;BR /&gt;This can include materials, labor, and overheads.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The account assignment object for actual posting is always the investment project/ WBS element.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Investment projects are relevant for asset accounting this is why they have an asset under construction (AuC) assigned.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Assets Under Construction &lt;/STRONG&gt;refer to the work-in-progress phase where a company is finalising the development or acquisition of long-term assets (like a building or a piece of machinery).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Costs related to the asset under construction are recorded in an asset under construction/ capital work-in-process account on the balance sheet. This account accumulates all expenditures until the asset is ready for its intended use.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The asset under construction is included in the asset history sheet and keeps detailed records of all costs related to investment projects for audit and regulatory purposes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Once the construction is completed and the asset is ready for use, the total accumulated costs in the asset under construction account are transferred to the appropriate fixed asset account on the balance sheet.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BirgitOe_5-1753102163236.png" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289368i10C781CDAC37780D/image-dimensions/760x246?v=v2" width="760" height="246" role="button" title="BirgitOe_5-1753102163236.png" alt="BirgitOe_5-1753102163236.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1600350654"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lifecycle of the Investment Project&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BirgitOe_0-1753262388377.png" style="width: 852px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290237i710F8516CF22F23B/image-dimensions/852x377?v=v2" width="852" height="377" role="button" title="BirgitOe_0-1753262388377.png" alt="BirgitOe_0-1753262388377.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP provides standard capabilities to manage the entire lifecycle of an investment project:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Project Creation&lt;BR /&gt;initiated via the app &lt;EM&gt;Project Control - Enterprise Projects&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cost Collection&lt;BR /&gt;Costs from procurement, time recording, and service are collected on the investment project WBS (work breakdown structure) elements&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Asset Under Construction (AuC) Creation&lt;BR /&gt;Automatically created when the project is released. Make sure you are using the project profile &lt;EM&gt;Investment Project&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Periodic or Event-Based Settlement&lt;BR /&gt;Periodic jobs can be scheduled via the app &lt;EM&gt;Schedule Overhead Accounting Jobs&lt;/EM&gt;. For processing of single investment projects, you can use &lt;EM&gt;Run Settlement – Actual&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;With release CE2508 a new functionality &lt;STRONG&gt;Event-based Settlement to AuC&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;is available. Using event-based settlement makes the periodic settlement process obsolete as all costs are settled immediately when posted to the investment project.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Final Settlement and Asset Capitalisation&lt;BR /&gt;Upon project completion, costs are settled to the final fixed asset. Costs that cannot be capitalised can be settled to other cost objects (e.g. cost centers).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1403837149"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How Project Settlement Works&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BirgitOe_2-1753101894113.png" style="width: 846px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/289365iD299000C95E36854/image-dimensions/846x248?v=v2" width="846" height="248" role="button" title="BirgitOe_2-1753101894113.png" alt="BirgitOe_2-1753101894113.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1336406363"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Settlement to Asset under Construction (AuC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;periodic settlement&lt;/STRONG&gt;: with the first settlement the rule to AuC gets automatically created (settlement type AUC)&lt;BR /&gt;PRE rules can be used to make sure non-capitalisable costs are not posted to the AuC.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;event-based settlement&lt;/STRONG&gt;: 100% of the costs will be settled to AuC, rules for preliminary settlement (PRE rules) are not supported, no AUC settlement rule is needed.&lt;BR /&gt;Event-based settlement is a new functionality made available with CE2508. It can be activated in the investment profile (for details on configuration see dedicated chapter).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1139892858"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Settlement to Final Asset&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the project is completed and the asset can be used, the AuC is cleared and costs are capitalised to the final asset.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The status of the investment project will be changed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;technically completed&lt;/STRONG&gt;. With this status the system carries out full settlement (distribution rules of type “full settlement” are used)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;in the event-based scenario the final settlement &lt;/STRONG&gt;will post to final receiver per line item, enabling the feature &lt;EM&gt;“list of origins reporting” &lt;/EM&gt;for the AuC and the final asset&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the processing type “partial capitalisation” can be used for a partial settlement to fixed asset/ other cost object, before the investment project is technically completed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-814296634"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Settlement Rules&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Define the receivers which could be AuC, final asset, or other cost objects.&lt;BR /&gt;Rules can be defined as percentages/ equivalences or amounts. Each rule comes with a validity period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Full Settlement (FUL)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;all costs posted to the sender, also costs in prior periods are settled&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ensures a balance of zero even if late postings to prior period occur&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;these rules are used for final settlements to the fixed asset,&lt;BR /&gt;or they can be used for partial capitalisation if values shall be moved out of the asset under construction before the asset is finished&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Preliminary Settlement (PRE)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;PRE rules are used during settlement to AuC &lt;SPAN&gt;(preliminary settlement), if part of the costs shall not be activated on AuC&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;U&gt;not&lt;/U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; available with event-based settlement&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Settlement to AuC (AUC)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;with periodic settlement these rules are automatically created with the first settlement, the receiver is the AuC&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Examples for different settlement/ distribution rules:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BirgitOe_4-1753263280248.png" style="width: 627px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290243i37F56A967FB240A3/image-dimensions/627x315?v=v2" width="627" height="315" role="button" title="BirgitOe_4-1753263280248.png" alt="BirgitOe_4-1753263280248.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;line 1 shows a rule&amp;nbsp;for settlement from AuC to cost object that can be used with processing type &lt;STRONG&gt;“Partial Capitalisation”&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;such rules need to be valid for one period only (from/to = identical)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;line 2 +3 show&amp;nbsp;rules for settlement to fixed asset (final settlement)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;line 4 shows a&amp;nbsp;rule for settlement to AuC (preliminary settlement)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;&amp;gt;

With this level of detail it is very easy to explain the asset value as for each posting can navigated back to the initial project posting. This kind of reporting is even available without using line item settlement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

This allows you to view recorded field changes for objects in various ways. You must enter the Object and Time Interval, as they are mandatory filters.

In this blog, I’ll walk you through these updates and what they mean for you.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My Home&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; offers immediate access to key business insights, supports efficient management of tasks and situations, and allows you to organize your favorite pages and apps to streamline daily operations. The 2508 release builds on this foundation by further enhancing each of these areas.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508 Release My Home" style="width: 971px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287517i0D319AF518EF6599/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MyHome_FullScreen_V2.png" alt="SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508 Release My Home" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508 Release My Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;On&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;e of the stan&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;dout additions is the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;new &lt;STRONG&gt;personalized salutation bar&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, which greets every business user upon entering My Home. This feature not only creates a more personalized experience but also helps users quickly orient themselves within SAP S/4H&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;ANA.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; Now enable &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;communication scenario &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP_COM_0887 and let &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;business &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;users see &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;what’s&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; next on their calendar&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;at a glance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Additionally, the salutation b&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;ar &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;consolidates&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;all of&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; My Home’s global actions in one convenient place—it enables users to easily add content, quickly access &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;My Home &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;settings, and discover the latest feature introduced in the 2508 release: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Recap&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="My Home Salutation bar" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287487iA18A8A0AEE5738A9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SalutationBar.png" alt="My Home Salutation bar" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;My Home Salutation bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recap&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; feature introduced in the My Home 2508 release is designed to save time by helping business users stay on top of key items that have emerged since their last login. It highlights high-priority information, enabling users to quickly focus on what matters most. By surfacing relevant updates and simplifying daily tasks, Recap reduces manual effort and helps users catch up efficiently—so they can shift their attention to higher-value activities.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="My Home Recap Tasks" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287488i8CAA1507529145BA/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Recap1.png" alt="My Home Recap Tasks" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;My Home Recap Tasks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Recap&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; analyzes changes in &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;My Home &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;data over the past 24 hours, keeping business users informed about new tasks, situations, and updates to app, tile, and insights card access. It also provides visual comparisons of insights cards, making it easy to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;quickly and intuitively understand&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; what has changed during your absence.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="My Home Recap Insights Cards" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287489i5705E68558100DEF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Recap2.png" alt="My Home Recap Insights Cards" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;My Home Recap Insights Cards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Salutation Bar&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; also allows business users to easily add content to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;My Home &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;from a centralized location.

This significantly streamlines the process of adding applications, saving &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;time&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; and offering a more intuitive, click-efficient experience— which is particularly valuable for first-time or occasional users. The feature also enhances transparency by displaying application descriptions and real-time KPIs for dynamic tiles, providing immediate operational context.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="My Home Beta AI-Assisted Adding of Apps and Insights Tiles" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287493i960482CC1DF414AB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MyHome_2508_AddContent_Apps&amp;amp;Tiles.png" alt="My Home Beta AI-Assisted Adding of Apps and Insights Tiles" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;My Home Beta AI-Assisted Adding of Apps and Insights Tiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My Home &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;serves as the central hub for all your tasks, applications, and information. The 2508 release introduces enhancements to the My Home user experience, featuring Recap and AI-Assisted Smart Personalisation. Additionally,&amp;nbsp; administrators are now empowered to deliver timely, targeted updates directly to business users via the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My Home &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;centralized news feed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the addition of the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Mange News application,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; news administrators can create news articles to be displayed on My Home. They can categorize, target and manage the visibility of the news. Tailoring communication to your organisation needs helps create a more informed and connected workforce.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Effective project and resource management is crucial for companies to deliver successful projects. Organizations running Enterprise Projects and/or Customer Projects in SAP Cloud ERP have the possibility to leverage SAP Project and Resource Management to optimize the project success. Resource Management is a process which spans normally over the complete lifetime of a project, starting with the initial finding and assignment of people, doing the continuous staffing forecasts and handling conflicts like substituting people. This blog provides an overview of how SAP Project and Resource Management facilitates these different staffing capabilities during the project life cycle of Enterprise Projects in SAP Cloud ERP.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enterprise projects in SAP Cloud ERP&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;can be used to manage different kinds of projects in different industries.&amp;nbsp;Examples are:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Overhead projects:&amp;nbsp;for example, administrative projects or projects for research and development,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Investment projects:&amp;nbsp;for example, projects to develop or maintain physical assets,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Projects with revenue:&amp;nbsp;for example, engineer-to-order projects,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Statistical projects: can be used for certain reporting needs, without carry actual costs itself&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Details about the different Project Types are documented in the following blog:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/the-two-project-control-possibilities-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-enterprise/ba-p/13577297" target="_blank"&gt;The two project control possibilities in SAP S/4HA... - SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Optimizing Resource Allocation:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Even in a simple project scenario, where an enterprise project merely serves as a cost collector without a formal project structure, managing resources is still required. Team members can log hours against the project, so optimizing resource allocation is crucial. To do this, you need clear visibility of available and skilled resources&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Resource Management capability of SAP Project and Resource Management covers the following key aspects:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Transparency: Overview of projects people are working on and identification of conflicts&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reduce time to staff for Projects:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Staffing: Find available and skilled people and staff persons as requested and consider their availability&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-assisted skill matching: overcome challenges like outdated employee profiles and reviewing many profiles manually&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Increase staffing accuracy: Project workers can directly maintain their forecasts based on when they are needed for a project&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Increase time-booking quality: SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Timesheet worklist includes projects on which person is staffed&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Single source of truth: the close integration between resource management information with the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Project data provides synchronized data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP unified User Experience&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Simple to adapt&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Basic scenarios and concepts:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Project and Resource Management is a SaaS offering on SAP Business Technology Platform. Once the subscription is in place a scope item facilitates the setup.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Users can choose if resource management apps for business users should directly run in the SAP Cloud ERP Launchpad, e.g. Project Managers using the Project-related apps can also directly see the resource management apps they need. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Setup:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To proceed with the setup the following sources contain more details.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Administration Guide:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/PPRM_OD/542f4545bc9d4ecd80bc3a0a6913a735/434f2ec669444cc98583a1c4eadca05a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/PPRM_OD/542f4545bc9d4ecd80bc3a0a6913a735/434f2ec669444cc98583a1c4eadca05a.html&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The blog “Setup Resource Management Capability in SAP Project and Resource Management” provides a summary how to proceed by setting up the integration:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/setup-resource-management-capability-in-sap-projects-and-resource/ba-p/13999829" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/setup-resource-management-capability-in-sap-projects-and-resource/ba-p/13999829&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Process:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Harmonizing staffing with project setup and milestone planning can reduce Backoffice efforts and allow people to focus on what is needed to deliver projects successfully instead of spending effort in maintaining consistent information across different sources. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The process starts in SAP Cloud ERP when a Resource demand is created:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="miguelvonrotz_0-1753268145912.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290284i9170A3741FB57EA7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="miguelvonrotz_0-1753268145912.png" alt="miguelvonrotz_0-1753268145912.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Screen shows the resource demand defined in the Enterprise Project&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once the Enterprise Project Integration is setup for SAP Cloud ERP “human resource” demands create the Resource Requests in Resource Management. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The process is explained along the most used apps in this blog.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;1. Manage Resource Requests (Role: Project Manager)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resource Request contains the need for a specific resource and is normally being refined by a user, e.g. Project Manager. During the refinement information about needed skills, scope description, requested resource organization are added. Once the request is complete the Project Manager can “publish” the request, so it becomes visible to the Resource Managers. No need to send additional information via email and capture the information directly where it is needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="miguelvonrotz_1-1753268145918.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290283iEFF709033AE2FB25/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="miguelvonrotz_1-1753268145918.png" alt="miguelvonrotz_1-1753268145918.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Screen shows the resource request which was published and includes “SAP Cloud ERP” as a required skill&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;2. Staff Resource Requests (Role: Resource Manager)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resource Managers review the request and start now with the search of candidates. Availability and Skill matching are performed and available candidates identified. Resource Manager can propose or directly staff one or multiple candidates:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Proposing a candidate, allows Project Manager to accept / decline candidates&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Soft booking is not yet confirmed staffing and only visible in resource management, while Hard booking is a confirmed booking type and people will see staffing in the SAP Cloud ERP timesheet app.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Forward requests, in case no suitable candidates are identified a request can be forwarded to another organization&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Learn more how the AI-Assisted Advanced Skill Matching facilitates the search of skilled candidates check:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/unlock-efficient-resource-management-with-ai-in-sap-project-and-resource/ba-p/13969113" target="_blank"&gt;Unlock Efficient Resource Management with AI in SA... - SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="miguelvonrotz_2-1753268145940.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290285i38A84C76E2BBE424/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="miguelvonrotz_2-1753268145940.png" alt="miguelvonrotz_2-1753268145940.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Screen shows the matching candidates list and the Advanced Skill Match for Lilian Blair – Lilian is being assigned by using the “Quick Assign” feature&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;3. Manage Resource Utilization (Role: Resource Manager)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Provides transparency how people are utilized, visualizes conflicts of over / under bookings and shows directly on which projects and roles people are working.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resource Managers can also create, change and move assignments in order to resolve conflicts and adjust the planning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="miguelvonrotz_3-1753268145948.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290287iE96B5E29485E1C64/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="miguelvonrotz_3-1753268145948.png" alt="miguelvonrotz_3-1753268145948.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Screen shows a list of filtered employees which includes Lilian Blair and her staffing for the Project Expert role&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;4. My Assignments (Role: Project Team Member)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once employees are staffed and have the needed authorization, they can maintain a staffing forecast means they can adjust in which weeks they work how many hours on a project. This allows them to refine and balance between different project assignments and align their involvement along with the planned project milestones, considering planned absences etc.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The updated information is afterwards visible for Resource- and Project Managers to ensure everyone has the updated information.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="miguelvonrotz_4-1753268145950.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290286iD568279FFE6108B5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="miguelvonrotz_4-1753268145950.png" alt="miguelvonrotz_4-1753268145950.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Screen shows mobile view of Lilian’s “My Assignment” app. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Staffed hours and candidates will be visible in SAP Cloud ERP. The Enterprise Project demand will get directly information about the assigned people and hours. This helps to bring up staffing information in the employee’s timesheet worklist to simplify timesheet capturing and reduce the time to find the right project.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Resources assignments and staffed hours are kept in synch between the SAP Cloud ERP and Resource Management, which ensures that all users have the same view on resource demands and what is being staffed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Project and Resource Management supports you by gaining transparency on your resource utilization situation with a fully integrated and embedded into the SAP User Experience scenario. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To learn more and to explore Resource Management in SAP Project and Resource Management you can find more information and access the free trial under:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/prm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.sap.com/prm&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Companies running Customer Projects in SAP Cloud ERP can also consult the following blog:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/overcoming-challenges-in-staffing-customer-projects-with-sap-project-and/ba-p/13748436" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/overcoming-challenges-in-staffing-customer-projects-with-sap-project-and/ba-p/13748436&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
