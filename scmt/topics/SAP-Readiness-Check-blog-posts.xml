    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Speeding up your SAP HCM move to the cloud in 2024&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2023 was another record-setting year for SAP customers moving their Human Capital Management processes to the cloud.&amp;nbsp; More SAP ERP HCM customers than ever before embarked on the journey with us, from hire-to-retire, including core HR, time, payroll and much more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;New tools, services and assets are helping to accelerate and de-risk the process of moving HR to the cloud. Several are even free, or available at no extra cost to customers with SAP Support. This blog post will be the first of three in a series covering developments that may be new to many of you, specifically:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Part 1:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors Solutions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Part 2:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; SAP Customer Evolution Kit for HXM (Human Experience Management)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Part 3:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Enterprise Strategy Group Economic Value study for moving from SAP ERP HCM to SAP SuccessFactors&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="steveschnoll_1-1709562374045.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/75051iABBE22AF027E8BA9/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="steveschnoll_1-1709562374045.png" alt="steveschnoll_1-1709562374045.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors solutions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From its launch in October 2022, SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors solutions tool adoption has outpaced our most optimistic projections. Feedback from customers and partners has been universally enthusiastic, and they are telling their friends – and us. And that input has led us to make the tool even better through more than a dozen enhancements delivered in 2023, with more to come in 2024.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/hxm-move.html?video=5e3a59f3-557e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors&amp;nbsp;solutions&lt;/A&gt; tool has now been run more than 500 times, in 42 countries, helping customers to accelerate and de-risk their moves beyond on-premise SAP ERP Human Capital Management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This SAP Readiness Check tool has saved many of these customers big money on consulting costs, while providing the equivalent of an MRI or x-ray into their as-deployed HCM configuration, including integrations, customizations, and usage data for key processes. Many customers have run it several times, in order to confirm the effect of their pre-migration clean-up efforts. Customers with employee counts ranging from under 500 employees to those with over 500,000 have all accrued benefits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on the analysis of the source system, the tool provides a comprehensive overview of specific parameters delivering:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Employee Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This reveals the distribution of employee master data figures per region, process, or status. Leverage this information in further discussions with an implementation partner to assess the migration project complexity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Organizational Structure Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Insight into the organizational structure master data will help to establish an understanding of key figures related to the allocation of employee-related data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Important HCM Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Insight into other HCM objects relevant to the HCM system setup, such as payroll calendars and payroll frequency defined within the analyzed system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Code Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Insight into the volume and variety of custom code objects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Understanding the status quo is a vital starting point for your HR journey to the cloud, which SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors solutions tool delivers. The next step typically entails engaging experts to help you to understand your options, and to build your case for change. We’ve got a couple of options to help, specifically:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href="https://webinars.sap.com/customer-evolution-kit/en/hxm" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Customer Evolution Kit for HXM&lt;/A&gt; provides SAP ERP HCM customers with a free workshop to help them get ready to modernize their HR system. The engagement provides customers with expert help for building a value case, interpreting their SAP Readiness Check results and mapping solutions to support their modernization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alternately, for customers just wanting to engage a specialist to review their SAP Readiness Check results, the Customer Success Services team from SAP offers &lt;A href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-9999954541_live_v1/advisory-service-for-sap-readiness-check-for-sap-successfactors-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Advisory Service for SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors solutions&lt;/A&gt;, available for a modest fee via the SAP Store.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More details about the SAP Customer Evolution Kit for HXM will follow in Part 2, and in Part 3 of this blog series, we will look at how customers can deliver &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/05/4adf96bd-767e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ROI (return on investment) of 100% or more&lt;/A&gt; from their HCM evolution projects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please also mark your calendar and click to register for an upcoming webinar on May 16th titled "&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4461441/965E4863C9962772C5BFA27AE7EEA24C?partnerref=Blog-Community-PartOne" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Fast-track your HR journey to the cloud with SAP partners&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is the SAP Customer Evolution Kit for HCM?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP &lt;A href="https://events.sap.com/customer-evolution-kit/en/hcm" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Customer Evolution kit for HCM&lt;/A&gt; is a cost-free, quick, and efficient engagement that provides a clear and seamless path for businesses and the partners who support them to accelerate transition from their on-premise SAP HCM solution to SAP SuccessFactors. It is delivered virtually by real live SAP experts, featuring a set of tools, methodologies, and services designed to simplify and streamline the migration process, while minimizing risks and ensuring business continuity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="steveschnoll_0-1714763757169.png" style="width: 676px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/105725i51F4DF16ACFE4D19/image-dimensions/676x380?v=v2" width="676" height="380" role="button" title="steveschnoll_0-1714763757169.png" alt="steveschnoll_0-1714763757169.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This SAP Customer Evolution kit helps customers address the challenges associated with migrating critical HCM data, configurations, and integrations from their on-premises systems to the cloud. With its step-by-step guidance, customers can plan, execute, and validate their migration strategies, ensuring a smooth and successful transition to SAP SuccessFactors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/speeding-up-your-sap-hcm-move-to-the-cloud-in-2024/ba-p/13627420" target="_self"&gt;Part 1 of this blog series&lt;/A&gt;, I shared some of the features and benefits of the SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors solutions. While SAP Readiness Checks can be run on a self-service basis, they are a bit like medical MRIs or X-rays in that, even if you could snap the picture yourself, the images are best interpreted by an expert trained in how to interpret the findings and recommend treatment plans. The SAP Customer Evolution kit for HCM provides you with the business equivalent of a radiologist, to provide expert readout of your organization’s unique SAP Readiness Check results, along with recommendations based on the findings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accelerating migrations for customers facing the end of maintenance or compatibility pack rights&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For businesses currently running on SAP HCM on-premises solutions, the clock is ticking. SAP has announced that mainstream maintenance for older enhancement packs of the on-premises HCM solution ends at the end of 2025. Many SAP S/4HANA customers running HCM and Finance together in the same environment also face expiration of compatibility pack rights at the end of 2025. This means that customers need to act now to ensure they are ready for the future while maintaining compliance and performance, as well as tapping innovations like Joule to bring relevant, reliable, responsible AI to HCM and the broader enterprise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Customer Evolution kit for HCM offers a unique opportunity for these customers to accelerate their migration journey. Over the course of three half-day sessions, and at no charge, it provides a roadmap and best practices to assess existing landscapes, identify gaps, and define a customized migration plan that aligns with unique goals and requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During these SAP Customer Evolution kit engagements, we’ve seen customers make all sorts of realizations about their legacy systems. These often include “Aha!” moments, when they realize that their current highly customized processes could be moved back to standard, easily supported standard functionality within SAP SuccessFactors HCM. Examples of such “Aha!” topics include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Legacy customizations supporting Concurrent Employment that required multiple PERNRs in on-prem could be more readily supported using standard configuration capabilities in Employee Central&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Grade step progression logic to support collective bargaining agreements that required custom infotypes in HCM could be supported using standard SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central and Compensation functionality&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support for Higher Duties and Grants and Funds accounting for Public Sector are available in SAP SuccessFactors.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These kinds of insights can rapidly demystify the legacy environment, clarify the state of the possible and provide expert guidance on how best to move forward to the cloud with the utmost confidence that all required business processes will be supported.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, if you’re looking for a free, fast, and helpful way to get organized around your HCM move to the cloud, we have the workshop to get you going.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Lead times to engage our experts are stretching as 2025 deadlines approach. Please sign up for your free SAP&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://events.sap.com/customer-evolution-kit/en/hcm" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Customer Evolution Kit for HCM&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;today!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please also mark your calendar and click to register for an upcoming webinar on May 16th titled "&lt;A href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4461441/965E4863C9962772C5BFA27AE7EEA24C?partnerref=Blog-Community-PartTwo" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Fast-track your HR journey to the cloud with SAP partners&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We are happy to announce the enhancement of the “Initial Data Migration Profile” in SAP Readiness Check for SAP ERP Usage and Data Profiling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 1.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/110716iAA745BB333222622/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 1.png" alt="Picture 1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 1: The old and new view of the Initial Data Migration Profile&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Initial Data Migration Profile of the SAP Readiness Check for SAP ERP Usage and Data Profiling analyzes important SAP ERP 6.0 data objects and their data volumes. The profile data delivers valuable input for the often tedious and costly exercise of manually scoping and assessing data objects. &lt;STRONG&gt;With this newest release&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we have enhanced the data collector and revamped the user experience when reviewing the results, displaying more information, and offering additional capabilities for slicing and dicing the information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following list highlights the new and enhanced features that are described in more detail further below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Where possible, a deeper level of data analysis providing more insight into the business objects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Filtering and grouping functions to enhance the user experience&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Introduction of new interactive UI elements to assist in the visualization of the findings&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The ability to run “what-if” scenarios supporting a selective data transition approach&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Where applicable, insight into the history of the data volume&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Identification of unused data objects and deprecated organizational units&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1272829440"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The New Data Collector&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We completely redesigned the Initial Data Profile data collector from scratch, replacing the existing collector as it only provided limited information regarding the analyzed data objects. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The scoping and development of the new data collector was done in cooperation and collaboration with the SAP Business Data Transformation Solutions team. SAP Readiness Check for SAP ERP Usage and Data Profiling and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/sap-business-transformation-center-digital-blueprint/ba-p/13570978" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Business Transformation Center&lt;/A&gt; now use the same data collector. This alignment helps expedite the move from evaluating and scoping to planning and conducting a selective data transition project.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Business objects are now used as data object identifiers, more commonly used to represent real-world artifacts than database table names. In total, 215 business objects are now analyzed by the data collector.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We have extended the analysis beyond the high-level data volume figures for many business objects and now provide insights into additional valuable data. For instance, you can now group results by organizational elements (e.g., company codes, plants, or sales organizations) depending on the attributes of the business object. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The data volumes can also be categorized in a historical context for business objects containing the necessary date attributes by defining year range filters. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Additionally, the new data collector now determines the first and last recorded activity dates for applicable business objects, helping to identify business objects no longer in use and resulting in a leaner data scope for the data migration.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These added values help project teams decide on the best transition approach. For instance, the Initial Data Migration Profile result can be used to evaluate the feasibility of a selective data transition approach by gaining initial insight into expected data volumes and facilitating the definition of the data scope. If the selective data transition approach is an option for your transition project, you can continue to investigate the data in detail and create a digital blueprint with the tool. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1076315935"&gt;The New Initial Data Migration Profile User Experience&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 2.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/110717i78769DF1C9735EC1/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 2.png" alt="Picture 2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 2: The new Initial Data Migration Profile dashboard card&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Initial Data Migration Profile dashboard card now presents a pie chart instead of a bar chart indicating the top 6 business objects by volume (see &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fig. 2&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;). To open the detail view, select any item from the pie chart or the dashboard card header.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The detailed view of the Initial Data Migration Profile was newly created from scratch and follows a flexible column layout model, which is available in many other SAP Fiori apps. The view lets users&lt;/SPAN&gt; quickly expand the column they want to focus on and switch between different layouts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 3.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/110718iDBA1D6C5EF791690/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 3.png" alt="Picture 3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 3: The new Initial Data Migration Profile view in 1-column mode&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By default, the view displays a table of all analyzed business objects (&lt;SPAN&gt;fig. 3&lt;/SPAN&gt;) including the following columns:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;business object name&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;application component&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;related table name of the business object&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;data type (master or transactional data)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;latest activity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;total number of items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Initially, the table is sorted by the number of items in descending order, which can be changed using the corresponding button on the top right of the table control. The content of the table can also be exported to a spreadsheet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To quickly search for a specific business object, start typing the object’s name into the search field on top of the table, and the table will filter accordingly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business objects with in-depth data analysis available have a detail indicator to the right of the last column in the row. Selecting a business object switches the view to the 2-column (detail) mode. The business object list is now shown in a compressed format on the left, while the detailed data of the selected business object is presented on the right side (see &lt;SPAN&gt;Fig. 4&lt;/SPAN&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To increase the space of the detail column to full screen or to close the detail column, use the corresponding buttons in the top right corner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 4.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/110719iF418E72E5C6AF78C/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 4.png" alt="Picture 4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 4: 2-column mode of the view showing the details of the selected business object&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The right column within the view is divided into two parts. The filter criteria and KPIs of the selected business object are shown at the top. The lower section presents charts and tables to visualize and support analyzing the data based on the selected filter criteria.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The capabilities that can be used to group and filter the business object data depend on the attributes of the selected business object. For example, the “FI Documents” business object has the filter criteria year and company code available. Other business objects, like “Equipment,” do not contain any aspect of time but can be grouped by plant. Some objects do not have any grouping capability, such as the business object “Status Management.” For these business objects, no detailed data is available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When the business object data contains date attributes, use the range slider control to set different intervals by year. The data is immediately filtered according to the selected range. Use the corresponding multi-select combo boxes to select filter criteria for organizational key elements, like company code or plant. All selected filter criteria are applied to the data immediately using “AND” logic. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;EM&gt;Selected Data Ratio&lt;/EM&gt; KPI visualizes the ratio between the total data volume of the selected business object and the data volume based on the applied filter conditions. Additionally, the business object’s oldest and latest activity dates are shown in the KPI section. The values for the total and filtered data volumes are displayed to help identify unused or no longer used business objects.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Depending on the capabilities of the business object’s grouping criteria, you can select different options to present and examine the business object volume data using the toolbar at the top of the data section. For example, the data within the “FI Document” business object can be analyzed using the following charts and tables:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 5.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/110722i4DCB3F2E34F3BFD4/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 5.png" alt="Picture 5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 5: Different options to present and examine the business object data&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When using the table option to view the business object detail, the table content can be exported to a spreadsheet for further processing by selecting the export button on top of the table.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-879802430"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Filter Criteria Views&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To increase usability, the new Initial Data Migration Profile allows users not only to define &lt;/SPAN&gt;and activate filter criteria for organizational and date-related key figures (e.g., company code, plants, year of creation, etc.) but to store them persistently in filter criteria views, which – once activated – are applied to all business object data, provided the criteria fields exist in the business object (otherwise the filter criteria is ignored).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This feature supports ongoing discussions about the data migration scope: You can define filter criteria views for different data migration scenarios and use them for what-if analysis. For example, you can save filter criteria evaluating the impact of migrating 3 or 4 years of historical data to the new system or analyze the effects of carving out one or more company codes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture_added1.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/111049iF6C7A8E3A9D7677D/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture_added1.png" alt="Picture_added1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 6: Expand and hide the filter section&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To set up a filter criteria view, expand the filter section above the business object table by selecting the related button (see Fig. 6). The filter section includes a set of multi-select combo boxes for all the available filter criteria. Choosing the values in these combo boxes defines the criteria for your filtered view. To apply your view’s filter criteria, select the &lt;EM&gt;Go&lt;/EM&gt; button at the bottom of the filter section (see Fig. 7).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 6.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/110723i1EEDEF26E3D5EB72/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 6.png" alt="Picture 6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 7: Setting up filter criteria views which are applied to all business objects&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you want to save your filtered view persistently for the analysis, select the drop-down button on top of the filter section (next to the caption “Standard”; see &lt;SPAN&gt;Fig. 7&lt;/SPAN&gt; and 8). This opens the “My Views” pop-up window, which lists any existing filter criteria views of the analysis and offers buttons to either save the currently selected filter criteria into a new view or to manage existing views (see &lt;SPAN&gt;Fig. 8&lt;/SPAN&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture_added2.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/111055i02FF34F508604823/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture_added2.png" alt="Picture_added2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 8: Create and manage filter criteria views&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To run an SAP Readiness Check for SAP ERP Usage and Data Profiling analysis, follow the instructions described in SAP Note &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3112362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3112362&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can also update an existing analysis by implementing the latest version of SAP Note &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3112362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3112362&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; and running the analysis in your SAP ERP system again.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Dear All,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note: This blog describes the addition of the Scope Analysis for Selective Data Transfer capability available within SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM. You may refer to this &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/availability-of-sap-readiness-check-for-sap-cloud-alm/ba-p/13554962" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;blog&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt; for an overview of the other checks available in SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM.&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This blog was updated on 6/04/2025 with information about the new matrix "Used Solution Documentation Relations" - see the Branch Data section.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Today, we are excited to announce that SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM has been extended to provide insights into solution documentation data in an SAP Solution Manager system in preparation for a solution documentation Selective Data Transfer project.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the Selective Data Transfer tool in SAP Solution Manager, you can select and extract the data in a format compatible with SAP Cloud ALM. The process to transfer the data is structured in the following steps:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 1: Process hierarchy (folder, scenario, organizational unit, master data)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 2: Process steps and executables&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 3: Business processes and diagrams&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 4: Documents and test steps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new &lt;STRONG&gt;Scope Analysis for Selective Data Transfer&lt;/STRONG&gt; allows one to view all solutions and branches in the analyzed SAP Solution Manager system, providing the necessary insights to select a source branch for a Selective Data Transfer project from SAP Solution Manager to SAP Cloud ALM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1145772670"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scope Analysis for Selective Data Transfer - Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The overview in the dashboard summarizes the total number of solutions and branches in the SAP Solution Manager system. Additionally, the bar chart displays the total number of changes to the elements within the branches. You can switch between views showing the last 6 or 12 months to see the aggregated number of changes to branches within these two time periods. The chart displays the top 5 solutions, based on the number of changes. When you navigate to the detail page of this analysis, you can see the aggregated number of changes for all solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 1.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/122314i697F9800B5E9DAC1/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 1.png" alt="Picture 1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;For more information about Selective Data Transfer from SAP Solution Manager to SAP Cloud ALM, see &lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-cloud-alm/transition-to-sap-cloud-alm/transition-to-calm-implementation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Transition to SAP Cloud ALM for Implementation&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt; in SAP Support Portal.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-949259165"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scope Analysis for Selective Data Transfer - Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The detailed view provides information for all solutions in the analyzed system, including a summary of the changes to solution documentation elements recorded in the solution documentation history. You may navigate the solutions using the sidebar panel on the left side of the page. When you select a solution in the sidebar, the details of the solution are presented in the content panel. For each solution, the following information is displayed:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solution Data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: This tab displays general information for the solution, including created logical component groups, solution settings, public scopes, used custom attributes, and used business partner attributes relevant to preparing SAP Cloud ALM for the data transfer from SAP Solution Manager.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Branches&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: A tab for each branch in the solution displays the solution documentation elements that are part of each Selective Data Transfer process step. The details include the number of objects within the specific branch and the number of changes recorded in the last 6 or 12 months from when the data collector ran in the SAP Solution Manager system.&lt;BR /&gt;In the case of Step 4 of the Selective Data Transfer process, the number of documents and test steps, along with the total size in mebibytes (1 Mebibyte = 1.024^2 bytes), are displayed.&lt;BR /&gt;The analysis also shows which solution documentation elements aren’t part of the selective data transfer process. These objects are excluded because an export tool is not planned or there is no equivalent entity in SAP Cloud ALM to support the import.&lt;BR /&gt;The list of used logical component groups provides insight into which group is referenced by at least one solution documentation element within the corresponding branch.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-752745660"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solution Data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This section displays general information for the solution, like the created logical component groups, solution settings, public sco&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;pes, used custom attributes, and used business partner attributes relevant to preparing SAP Cloud ALM for the data transfer from SAP Solution Manager. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Additionally, this section presents the configurations and customizations that need to be adapted or mapped to correctly transfer the selected branch data into SAP Cloud ALM.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 2.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/122327iB26A728540C12597/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 2.png" alt="Picture 2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;The following configurations are displayed in this tab for the selected solution:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Logical Component Groups: Displays a table with the logical component groups created in the selected solution, with the information on whether sites are enabled and if the logical component group is referenced for any solution documentation element in any branch within the solution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configurations: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Document types: Provides the number of custom document types in use.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Status Schemas: Provides the number of custom status schemas in use.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Content Languages: Provides a list of languages active in the solution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Scopes: Shows the list of public scopes that exist in the solution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Custom Attributes: Shows the list of custom attributes in use.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Business Partner Attributes: Shows the list of related business partner attributes used by at least one document in the solution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-556232155"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Branch Data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This section details the solution documentation elements of each step within the Selective Data Transfer process. The details include the number of objects in a branch and the number of changes recorded 6 or 12 months before the data collection in the SAP Solution Manager system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, it includes the list of elements from the solution documentation that aren’t part of the selective data transfer process. These objects are excluded because an export tool is not planned or there is no equivalent entity in SAP Cloud ALM to support the import.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The information for each branch is displayed in the same structure as the Selective Data Transfer process is expected to run. The details provide insights into how each branch is used, the elements changed in the last 6 or 12 months, and the expected sizing the future content management server should have to support the documents from the SAP Solution Manager system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 3.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/122328iCC9FB69CABA883C8/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 3.png" alt="Picture 3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The number of changes for all solution documentation elements is obtained from the history of the solutions, and the figures for the last 6 or 12 months are calculated from the data collection date.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;/SPAN&gt;The solution documentation elements in and out of scope depend on the current SAP Solution Manager transition strategy to SAP Cloud ALM and may change anytime.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Update on 6/04/2025:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The branch section now shows a matrix with the relation between the elements in solution documentation that are used and supported by both SAP Cloud ALM and the Selective Data Transfer Tool. The matrix shows where the branch contains data for these relations and combination with the availability, it helps to determine if the complete transfer of the solution documentation to SAP Cloud ALM using the Selective Data Transfer tool is possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="documentation_CALM.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/269271iC0E4DEF9FDA33190/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="documentation_CALM.jpg" alt="documentation_CALM.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-359718650"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Collection&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP Solution Manager data collector has been updated to include the required data for the new Scope Analysis for Selective Data Transfer capability. Ensure that version 31 (or higher) of SAP Note &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3236443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3236443&lt;/A&gt; is implemented before running the collector program in your SAP Solution Manager system. You can either create a new SAP Readiness Check analysis or update an existing analysis using the &lt;EM&gt;Update Analysis&lt;/EM&gt; function to upload the enhanced data collection archive. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As always, we look forward to receiving your feedback!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Your SAP Readiness Check Team&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Want some examples?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Signavio/pd-p/088166be-6441-4660-9e5b-1a046de322bf" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="36-1"&gt;SAP Signavio&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;customers can import and use an interactive "&lt;A href="https://sapsignavio.enable-now.cloud.sap/pub/2023salesplays/index.html?show=slide!SL_F596C6DC51809A9" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Activate Accelerator&lt;/A&gt;" which is describing in detail how the SAP Signavio suite can support them in SAP S/4HANA implementations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here is an updated cookbook on "&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/S4H_1751%20S4HANA_HRBP_Cookbook_NEW_FINAL.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Employee Business Partner Integration&lt;/A&gt;".&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Don't miss the updated "&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2019/05/44b3ebd5-4b7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manifesto&amp;nbsp;for senior IT leadership&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;". Although targeting to private cloud, on premise customers can easily identify what is relevant for them.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We added information on "&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/content/dam/support/en_us/library/ssp/alm/ALM4S4HC-CALMorSOLMAN.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Cloud ALM vs. SolMan&lt;/A&gt;". In case you go with SAP Cloud ALM, this &lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/content/dam/support/en_us/library/ssp/alm/sap-cloud-alm-for-implementation/Implement-S4HANA-Cloud-Private-Edition.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Best Practice document&lt;/A&gt; provides information also for on premise implementations (compressed on 300 pages).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What I like very much is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-guidance-framework/guidance-framework/what-is-sap-btp-guidance-framework?q=SAP%20BTP%20Guidance%20Framework" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP Guidance Framework&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. It bundles information for both architects and developers: Architecture guidance, methodologies and developer guides are right next to each other.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The whole topic of enablement / learning has been restructured. It is now harmonized across the roadmaps in SAP Activate.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We also enhanced the content for system conversion. You will find new activities / tasks like "&lt;A href="https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/?sap-language=EN#/group//roadmap/S4HANATRANSONPRE:001999B7BD851ED68BCCBFC6CDCF02CE/node/07A6AFA7228D4064B418D04B0A0EAD8A" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Conversion Readiness Assessment&lt;/A&gt;" or "&lt;A href="https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/?sap-language=EN#/group//roadmap/S4HANATRANSONPRE/node/B97CFCD046754071907A5C1EFD888296" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Decide on Conversion Strategy&lt;/A&gt;", and we will continue on this topic in future.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can find the new release of the “&lt;A href="https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/?sap-language=EN#/group//roadmapOverviewPage/S4HANATRANSONPRE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Transition to SAP S/4HANA&lt;/A&gt;” roadmap in the “&lt;A href="https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/?sap-language=EN#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Roadmap Viewer&lt;/A&gt;”. And as you already know, we will push the updated content into SAP Cloud ALM for you within the upcoming days.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hopefully you will enjoy it!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;As organizations worldwide continue to navigate the complexities of digital transformation, many that still rely on SAP ERP or the on-premises version of SAP S/4HANA are considering a major change: migrating to the cloud. This move isn’t just about a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic decision that could shape the future of your business. To help you get started, we’ve completely updated our guide, &lt;EM&gt;Mapping Your Journey to SAP S/4HANA&lt;/EM&gt;, with practical insights, step-by-step instructions, best practices, and detailed background information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keeping up with the fast pace of digital change isn’t just beneficial — it’s essential. Industries like automotive, with their complex supply chains, clearly demonstrate the risks of not adapting quickly. That’s exactly why we created the original guide back in 2018, which quickly became a go-to resource for many companies. Now, I’m excited to share that we’ve just released a fully updated edition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This edition brings together insights from dozens of SAP experts across the company, each sharing their unique perspectives and experiences. Inside, you’ll find a comprehensive guide that covers every aspect of the transition to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. We’ve focused on the key technology elements to help IT decision-makers confidently plan their roadmap, avoid common pitfalls, and ensure a smooth path to a successful go-live.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What makes this guide special is the wealth of knowledge it offers — drawn from thousands of successful transformation projects. It’s more than just a collection of tips; it’s packed with real-world experience, brought to life with clear text and visuals. Since every project is unique, we’ve included plenty of links to additional resources so you can rely on this guide at every step of your migration journey. The feedback from our customers speaks for itself: the guide has been downloaded more than 180,000 times since it was first published.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why an update to our key reference&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You may be wondering why a new edition, and why now? As one of the co-authors, I can tell you that while we’ve always kept the guide up to date, the past six years have seen major changes in the SAP landscape. New tools and methods have emerged, and our RISE with SAP offering has grown significantly. These developments have changed the way we help customers move to Cloud ERP, so it’s the perfect time to update the guide with these innovations and the valuable feedback we’ve received from our customers and partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our goal with this guide remains the same: to give IT leaders everything they need in one place to successfully implement SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. We've carefully organized the guide into three key chapters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Strategic decisions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the first chapter, we’ll help you make smart choices about the transition. We cover everything from deciding between public and private cloud options to understanding the unique benefits of the GROW with SAP and RISE with SAP programs, and even navigating the complexities of cloud operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Ingredients for project success&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The middle section delves into the critical factors that determine the success of your project. We discuss change management, knowledge management, customer and supplier master data integration, the partner ecosystem, and more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Essential tools from SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The final chapter provides an in-depth look at the 15 most important tools available to help you assess your systems, plan and execute the migration, and track project progress. These include SAP Data Services, SAP Readiness Check, ABAP development tools, and the SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More than just a guide, &lt;EM&gt;Mapping Your Journey to SAP S/4HANA&lt;/EM&gt; is your trusted companion as an IT leader navigating a complex transformation. Whether you’re diving into the theory or need practical tips to keep your organization on track beyond 2027, this guide has you covered. You can read it cover to cover for a complete understanding or use it as a quick reference for specific stages or challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I invite you to download it today and take the next step in your digital transformation journey: &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/docs/download/2019/05/44b3ebd5-4b7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Download now&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Please note: The following blog describes the new Change Request Management Insights functionality available within SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;You may also refer to the other blogs about features in SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/prepare-your-selective-data-transfer-to-sap-cloud-alm-with-sap-readiness/ba-p/13727856" target="_blank"&gt;Prepare your Selective Data Transfer to SAP Cloud ALM with SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/service-and-administration-capabilities-in-sap-readiness-check-for-sap/ba-p/13584301" target="_blank"&gt;Service and Administration Capabilities in SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-supports-your-transition-to-sap-cloud-alm-with-sap-readiness-check/ba-p/13994078" target="_blank"&gt;SAP supports your transition to SAP Cloud ALM with SAP Readiness Check&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/availability-of-sap-readiness-check-for-sap-cloud-alm/ba-p/13554962" target="_blank"&gt;Availability of SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Dear All,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, we are excited to announce that SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM now provides additional insights into the usage of Change Request Management capabilities in an SAP Solution Manager system to support the planning of the transition of your change-controlled landscapes to SAP Cloud ALM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new &lt;STRONG&gt;Change Request Management Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt; check reads and collects the usage details for all active change cycles in your SAP Solution Manager system. It allows you to quickly identify the usage of individual change request management capabilities within each cycle and see which systems of your landscape are managed by each cycle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1074006938"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Change Request Management Insights - Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The chart in the dashboard card summarizes the total change documents created within the active cycles, &amp;nbsp;aggregated by transaction type. This chart provides an overview of the change types being managed within the change cycles in your change-controlled landscapes. Note that only active cycles at the time of the data collector run are used to create this analysis. The data collector ignores closed change cycles; as a result, they are not considered within the statistics displayed in the findings of this check.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select any item from the pie chart or the dashboard card header to open the detail view.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/187303i894D415CBE191655/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture 1.png" alt="Picture 1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-877493433"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Change Request Management Insights - Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The detail view provides complete usage figures for the analyzed change cycles. The information includes, for example, the aggregated number of change documents and transport requests, the integration of change documents with Solution Documentation, and the number of tracks the cycle controls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The provided details help identify the change cycles that control most of the changes, where large or complex landscapes are being managed, and which change cycles use complex change request management scenarios. These insights help to plan the transition to SAP Cloud ALM. For example, it might be advisable to start with transitioning simple landscapes and continue with other more complex landscapes at a later stage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The two charts on top of the detail view provide filtering options for the Items table below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can filter by &lt;EM&gt;Active Change Cycle Type&lt;/EM&gt; by selecting a type in the pie chart at the top-left of the page.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The &lt;EM&gt;Usage of Change Request Management Capabilities Across Cycles&lt;/EM&gt; chart at the top-right of the page allows for the filtering of the Items table based on capability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 2.png" style="width: 968px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/187304i88780558B8230E19/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture 2.png" alt="Picture 2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-810062647"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Additional Information for Change Cycles&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;For each change cycle in the table, click the number of a Cycle ID to open a side panel with additional insights. This panel provides the details of the tracks, showing the systems and roles that are part of the change-controlled landscape. In addition, it shows how many Requests for Change and Change Documents have been created within the cycle, aggregated by transaction type. The Usage section of the panel provides the date of the latest usage of the individual change request management capabilities, helping to identify those capabilities not used recently.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 3.png" style="width: 968px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/187305i8CDBAEDC1CD17480/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture 3.png" alt="Picture 3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM scenario already provides details for the availability of equivalent capabilities in SAP Cloud ALM for each displayed change request management capability. To see if required capabilities are already available or planned in SAP Cloud ALM, you can navigate directly to the &lt;EM&gt;Availability of Relevant Capabilities&lt;/EM&gt; dashboard using the provided link at the bottom of the Usage section within the right-side panel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-484466423"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Collection&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Readiness Check for SAP Cloud ALM data collector, which runs in SAP Solution Manager, has been updated to include the required data for the new Change Request Management Insights capability. Ensure version 43 (or higher) of SAP Note &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3236443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3236443&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; has been implemented before scheduling the collector. Once the data collector is complete, you can use the generated data archive to create a new SAP Readiness Check analysis or update an existing analysis (using the &lt;EM&gt;Update Analysis&lt;/EM&gt; function to upload the enhanced data collection archive).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As always, we look forward to receiving your feedback!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your SAP Readiness Check Team&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Readiness Check Report helps us understand the mandatory changes when moving from ECC to S/4HANA or &lt;SPAN&gt;just&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; upgrading to the newest version on S/4HANA. Through this information, all the customers &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;will be able to&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; plan their projects accordingly to have the system ready for a smooth transition. From a functional perspective, this report shows us 2 main pieces of information, the first one is the Simplification Item list, which highlights the mandatory changes and the items that are out of the architecture target in S/4HANA and won't be considered for further innovations. The second one is the Compatibility Scope Matrix, which lists the compatibility packages (CP), this contains the details of the functionalities that have a limited use right to SAP S/4HANA and recommends the solution alternative and the strategy to move forward.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This blog will explain the common items relevant as part of the compatibility scope under the Production Planning module, describing the details and the alternative function to be considered when replacing it. Functions that are part of the compatibility scope&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;can be used just until the expiry date of the compatibility pack license&lt;/STRONG&gt;, meaning at the end of 2025. Even when SAP recently announced the &lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2020/02/sap-s4hana-maintenance-2040-clarity-choice-sap-business-suite-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;maintenance extension for SAP Business Suite 7&lt;/A&gt; until the end of 2027, the usage rights of the compatibility packs were not included in this extension. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Luckily and because the complexity of each item, there &lt;SPAN&gt;is a specific extension of compatibility scope usage rights for a few modules until 2030. Under manufacturing, this applies to selected items under the component of Production Planning in Process Industry (PP-PI). If you are interested in checking the full details list of the compatibility Scope Matrix please review the attachments of &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2269324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Note 2269324&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. There you will find the components marked with &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(D)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, meaning whose are the items relevant for the extension.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My intention through this blog is to mainly aware and remind all the readers about what items are relevant considering the timing! But in the end, is up to each customer to decide when they will keep it or will start to migrate to the designated alternative functionality. The decision, of at which point in time this will be done, should be taken early in advance to plan accordingly for the migration efforts!! Keep in mind the end of 2025 is around the corner!!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now, let’s get started and finally introduce some of the items for the Production Planning scope. Keep in mind this list doesn't contain a description of all of them, just explains the common items that I typically see relevant, based on my experiences with multiple customers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Classical MRP list&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is one of the main items, and in most cases applies to those customers who are still running the classic MRP as part of their process. The majority decided to keep it due to the restriction by using MRP live and/or some custom developments where MRP list tables need to be read. In S/4HANA the MRP live code has an optimized logic, where is no longer needed the creation of an MRP list without causing a huge concern from a performance point of view. In addition, the evaluation based on the MRP list isn't optimal because is not going to consider new requirements that could be created meanwhile the finished of the MRP run and the real-time when the planners have to do the checking, because is just and snapshot of the result.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;In general, the creation of the MRP list by running the classic MRP won't be possible anymore after the end of 2025, but the classic MPR will still work for those customers that have other restrictions to be considered before moving to MRP live.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;Now what happens if we still need the MRP list creation? The best suggestion will be to check always read stock/requirements lists via API MD_MDPSX_READ_API or BAPI BAPI_MATERIAL_STOCK_REQ_LIST., as suggested in the &lt;A href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Note&amp;nbsp;2268085&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. In addition, SAP offers the standard report RMDMRPEXTRACT01, which extracts the planning data and saves it into a custom table, similar to the results generated by the MRP list. You can find more information about the MRP lust alternative by checking the blog &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/mrp-lists-are-gone-with-mrp-live-what-should-i-do-now/ba-p/13534158" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MRP Lists are gone with MRP Live! What should I do now?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Flow Manufacturing:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;Flow manufacturing in ERP includes functions for line design, line balancing as well and rate/takt-based sequence planning. It is part of repetitive manufacturing solution and only suitable for repetitive manufacturing planned orders. Because is now part of the compatibility scope, means that you need to migrate from ERP line design, ERP line balancing, and ERP sequence planning to its designated alternative functionality which is now fully covered by&amp;nbsp;PPDS model mix planning and sequencing.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Graphical Planning Table:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Currently there are a bunch of troubles and open incidents due to the complexity when managing the chart and graphical planning tables provided in SAP GUI. Even when the transactions CM21, CM22, CM23, CM25, with graphical planning table or Gantt Chart are still available in SAP S/4HANA on-premise are not part of the target architecture in S/4HANA and remain as obsolete. To have a better user experience and make easier the understanding and the analysis by the planners, the recommendation is to replace those by using new Fiori Apps like "Manage Work Center Capacity", "Capacity Scheduling Table", and "Capacity Scheduling Board" in SAP S/4HANA. If you are interested in knowing more about this new application on PP-CP, please check my previous blog: &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/did-you-know-this-about-capacity-planning-in-s-4hana/ba-p/13579456" target="_blank"&gt;Did you know this about Capacity Planning in S/4HANA?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;In addition, you can consider &lt;A href="http://help.sap.com/dmc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; - DMC component Resource Orchestration REO. REO works on more granular data defined in DMC. In a job-shop environment, for example, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;work-centers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; could be defined in SAP S/4HANA and the individual machines only in DMC.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;Last but not least, is important to know you can also have the possible to use embedded PP/DS if exists complex scheduling problems, for example, planned and production orders of different BOM levels need to be synchronized, or if material availability needs to be considered in scheduling, or if multiple bottleneck resources must be aligned by optimizing the schedule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Logistics Information System In PP:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;LIS data can be analyzed based on statistical data, which is contained in "information structures". Important key figures are directly updated from the operative application to the information structures. Where historically, Historically, following LIS tables (mentioned below) were used for standard or custom reports in Production Planning (S021, SFIS, &amp;nbsp;S022, SFIS, S023, SFIS, S024, and S026). However, LIS in PP is part of the S/4HANA compatibility pack and even when you can continue using LIS tables, and are available, won’t be considered as part of the new technologies anymore. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Considering future production analytics will be based on HANA, CDS views will be able to aggregate&amp;nbsp;transactional data dynamically, and powerful analytical UIs for multi-dimensional reporting, resulting in the best option to replace the current LIS. Once switching you will note improvements in the performance of many transactions (fewer tables to update, fewer locking conflicts) and less memory consumption. Please refer to the following blog for further information: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/custom-analytical-queries-as-an-alternative-for-lis-in-sap-s-4hana/ba-p/13700408" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Custom Analytical Queries as an alternative for LIS in SAP S/4HANA Production Planning (PP)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Forecast-Based Planning:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Forecast-based planning (MRP type VV) is not strategic anymore within SAP S/4HANA and should be avoided if possible. This is because the MRP creates planned orders or purchase requisitions if the total forecast demand up to a certain point of time exceeds the total firmed receipt quantity up to the same point of time. The total firmed receipt quantity includes inventory, production orders, purchase orders, firmed planned orders, and firmed purchase requisitions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;An alternative exists and is by using PIRs (Planned Independent Requirement) instead of forecast demands. Provides several advantages in S/4, allowing benefits like&amp;nbsp;APIs available&amp;nbsp;to handle PIRs, new FIORI-apps like 'Maintain PIRs' for better management, PIRs allow for consumption with sales demands and dependent requirements or stock transfer demands, the possibility to split PIRS and re-organize unused PIR demands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;So what should we do if MRP type VV is still in place? &lt;SPAN&gt;First, convert forecast requirements into planned independent requirements (PIR) and then change MRP type VV to one of the MRP types as PD, P1, P2, P3, or P4 &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;which doesn’t have direct consideration of&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; forecast.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Control Recipes/Instructions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Due to the several improvements in the used communication technology (currently via t-RFC), the usage of control recipes/control instructions in conjunction with browser-based PI sheets and work instructions is part of the SAP S/4HANA compatibility scope. As an alternative, it is possible to keep using the control recipes/control instructions in conjunction with linking process control systems and other external systems by using Manufacturing Execution Connect (classic).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;SAP S/4HANA provides new Process Order integration capabilities with new SOAP and oData APIs, where the Control Instruction capabilities will be offered now as part of SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud and can be sent to MES, e.g. to SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud, with new SOAP APIs.&amp;nbsp;Please refer to &amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Feature Scope Description&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; or note&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3035649" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3035649 &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;FAQ :&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Manufacturing Execution Connect (classic)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;A similar recommendation applies for &lt;STRONG&gt;Process Messages&lt;/STRONG&gt;, also an item relevant for PP in compatibility scope, you can check further details on the&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2270231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; SAP Note 2270231&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Process Instruction Sheets:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Browser-based PI sheets are used in the regulated environment (pharmaceutical production, and so on) to control and track the production execution. The content of the PI Sheet/Work Instruction is rendered as plain HTML and displayed in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/70396d7dec4c4f19b9ca3b2e47559d12/4d77a65efe472b8ae10000000a42189b.html?q=%22control%20framework%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP HTML Viewer&lt;/A&gt; of ABAP SAP GUI screens and depends on MS Internet Explorer. The new architecture recommends the usage of Digital Manufacturing Cloud’s (DMC) Production Operator Dashboard (POD) which provides similar functionality as PI-sheets. It will allow displaying Work Instructions, recording of actual data, and enforcing predefined production processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px lia-align-justify" style="padding-left : 30px; text-align : justify;"&gt;Please be careful &lt;SPAN&gt;and after&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; switching from browser-based PI Sheets/Electronic Work Instructions to SAP DMC, remember to check your custom code in the context of data transfer from&amp;nbsp;browser-based PI Sheets/Electronic Work Instructions to whatever receiver and&amp;nbsp;clean up your custom code that &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;makes use of&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;this functionality.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hope you find helpful the information provided in terms of understanding the compatibility pack and start to think about the action plan to complete the replacement of the function and adopt the S/4HANA strategy within the given timeline. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Further information:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/release-upgrade-maintenance/maintenance-information/maintenance-strategy/maintenance-phases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Support Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blogs-by-sap/the-future-of-compatibility-packs-in-sap-s-4hana/ba-p/13426883" target="_blank"&gt;The Future of Compatibility Packs in SAP S/4HANA&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Do not forget to follow us via&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="http://twitter.com/sap" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;@SAP&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and #S4HANA, or myself via&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/178296"&gt;@Jennicherrera&lt;/a&gt; and LinkedIn:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferchs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Jennifer Carolina Herrera Suárez | LinkedIn&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Have a nice day!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Regards&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Jennifer&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Nonetheless, in all &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;possible project&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; scenarios, the customer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;vendor synchronization is mandatory as a pre-conversion step for S&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;4HANA conversion due to the &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2265093/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Business Partner Approach&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, meaning that the business partner is now the leading object&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; for legal entities. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Being so, the&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; BP synchronization&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; can be achieved by following the steps of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;well-known KBA &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2713963/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2713963&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;When doing this activity for a big pharmaceutical client in Brazil, I have faced a complex scenario &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;w&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;h&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;ere&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; I &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;ha&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;d &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;elaborate a&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; flowchart &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;facilitate&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;the definition of &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;phases of conversion&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;which&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;appear&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;ed&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; difficult to assess at first glance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; In this blog post I am going to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;disclose&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; details about this flowchart &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;to help others that may have the same complex scenario.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;The scenarios&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Keep the&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; same numbers between BP and customer/vendor&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;A&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;question that must be answered is if there is a desire to keep the business partner and the customer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;vendor with the same number. This means that when &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;maintaining&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; the entity’s master data in transaction BP, the number entered is the same used in the creation of transactional documents.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Keep number or reassign.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/229609i2C528917E886199E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Keep number or reassign.png" alt="Keep number or reassign.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;In the above example, customer 11 ha&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;s&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; the same number as &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;its &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;BP, but the vendor &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;doesn’t&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;If it is not mandatory to keep the same one, then the BP range number can be configured &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;independently,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; and the BP conversion is not complex in terms of number assignment. But if there is the desire to keep all &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;possible numbers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; the same, then an analysis must be done of the current account groups range number customizing, using transaction OBAR and OBAS together with XDN1 and XKN1, which may culminate in the next scenarios.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;C&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;ustomers/vendors out of the current customized number range&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;As well described in SAP &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;documentations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; about BP conversion, all &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;created &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;customers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;vendors are &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;scope of&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; the conversion, even though they are marked for deletion, unless they are archived. This means that in some scenarios, the number of &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;an old customer or vendor may be out of date&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, because its&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; account group &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;number range &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;could have been changed through time&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Customers out of current customized range.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/229616i2A2356458D2ED4FF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Customers out of current customized range.png" alt="Customers out of current customized range.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;The result is existing customers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;vendors with a number range different than the current customizing for its account group in OBAR&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;OBAS&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, like in the above example, where the customer highlighted is a DEBI, which is configured to numerate from 900000 to 999999, therefore its number “1” is out of date&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;. If this is part of the project scenario, then these entities with old range numbers can have their number reassigned&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;*&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;*&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size="1 2 3 4 5 6 7"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Of course, the number reassignment is only &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;an option&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;. Even though the number may be out of the current customized range, one can always do a temporary configuration just to run the BP synchronization for these customers/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;vendors and&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; then configure back to the current customizing. But this could result in several phases of conversion in &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;production&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; system, that may not be &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;feasible&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; in certain clients.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; Also, as standard the transaction BP shows a warning message when the number range of the opened BP is out of the current number range customized, so this may not be desirable.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Customer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;s and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;vendor&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;s&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; with same number&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;The last check that can be made is if there &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;are&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; customers and vendors that do not belong to the same legal entity&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; but have the same number. This happens because the account groups for customers are different elements in SAP than the account groups for vendors, meaning that they can have the same number range.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Customer and vendor with same number.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/229619i00FB7BDA9A822D1A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Customer and vendor with same number.png" alt="Customer and vendor with same number.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;As the business partner is now the leading object and have only one central number range configured, if a customer and vendor have overlapping numbers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;First, the system needs to be prepared, that is, the ECC system is moved to the S4 HANA structure by technical consultants (BASIS-ABAP). For this, they upload the relevant sap notes to the system and create a sandbox system. All module consultants provide testing and controls in this test system, then if necessary, the 2nd sandbox system can be installed as a development system or directly to the QA system, then the live system will be switched.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="1.png" style="width: 597px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/232898i6E8215A2DD845E88/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="1.png" alt="1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Throughout the project you will hear the following terms very often SI Check List and SI items&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SI: Simplification Item.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technical consultants run Simplification Item Check Report and if there is an error or inconsistency, they assign it to the relevant module consultants.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All module consultants check their own inconsistencies and errors and make the necessary corrections.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;go to se38&amp;nbsp;/SDF/RC_START_CHECK&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="2.png" style="width: 982px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/232900iBBEC76FBCAD6A7F2/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2.png" alt="2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/232901i1230D3C1A11DD87A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="3.png" alt="3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can check SI ıtem and sap notes in this report&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/232902i8AC36BA87046C968/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="4.png" alt="4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Readiness Check Cloud Application&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ZIP files are created and uploaded to the SAP Readiness Check Cloud App. The data here can be read by consultants and verified before being uploaded to the application.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="5.png" style="width: 598px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/232904iAAA252C7BE090A1B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5.png" alt="5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information on this part, see this video published by SAP&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/RC_Version_3.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://support.sap.com/content/dam/SAAP/SAP_Activate/RC_Version_3.mp4&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After this technical transition, module consultants start working on the transaction codes, tables, structures that change with S4 Hana in the sandbox system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The most important topics are as follows;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;-CVI integration, also called BP Configuration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;-Transfer of price and credit master and credit management and control of the changing structure&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, additional processing is required for Condition Master Data mappings because the data will now be used in the PRCD_ELEMENTS table instead of the KONV table.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear All,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA can now be used for both&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA (on premise) and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition (PCE/RISE) target product versions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;​SAP S/4HANA and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition are developed in the same codeline and are identical concerning the relevant simplification items. Nevertheless, there are differences in the compatibility scope items and successor functionalities (for example the successor of FI-TV on premise is Travel Management, on PCE the successor is SAP Concur).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The correct target SAP S/4HANA version is selected in the dropdown list in the SAP Readiness Check data collection report RC_COLLECT_ANALYSIS_DATA:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="2025-04-14_14-14-48.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/250544i6811E10A88BE478F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2025-04-14_14-14-48.png" alt="2025-04-14_14-14-48.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please note: To see the "SAP S/4HANA private Cloud" entries in the list, you may need to&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;update your local replica of the simplification item catalog&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;To determine whether any action is required&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, go to transaction SA38 in the system to be analyzed and run report RC_COLLECT_ANALYSIS_DATA. If the SAP S/4HANA private Cloud versions are not yet visible in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Target S/4HANA Version&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;list, the local replica of the simplification item catalog needs to be updated.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To update the Simplification Item Catalog, perform the following steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Execute the report /SDF/RC_START_CHECK in the source system via transaction SA38.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Choose the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Update Catalog with latest version from SAP&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;button.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;As a result, the local replica of the simplification item catalog will be updated. You can now run report RC_COLLECT_ANALYSIS_DATA again, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Target S/4HANA Version&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;list will now include the latest generally available SAP S/4HANA product versions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;----------------&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manual Upload of the Simplification Item Catalog&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Alternatively, if the SAP-SUPPORT_PORTAL RFC destination is unable to connect with the SAP support backbone,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;you can update the simplification item catalog content manually&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Open the simplification item catalog content in&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/sic/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Download Simplification Item&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;icon to download the content to your local computer.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Run the report /SDF/RC_START_CHECK.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Upload Simplification Item Catalog from the file&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;button and upload the content from where you saved it in step 2.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now you can execute report RC_COLLECT_ANALYSIS_DATA again. The latest SAP S/4HANA product versions will now be visible in the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Target S/4HANA Version&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;list. Proceed as described in&amp;nbsp;SAP Note&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2913617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2913617&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(SAP S/4HANA conversions) or SAP Note&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3059197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3059197&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;(SAP S/4HANA upgrades) to perform the data collection and create the new analysis.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As SAP Advanced Planning and Optimization (SAP APO) is a component of SAP Supply Chain Management (SAP SCM), and SAP SCM 7.0 will reach the end of mainstream maintenance in the coming years, customers need to plan and migrate from SAP APO to SAP Integrated Business Planning (SAP IBP), leverage the integrated supply chain planning functionality within SAP S/4HANA, or a combination of both.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Today, we proudly announce the general availability of SAP Readiness Check for SAP Supply Chain solutions to assist in planning this transformation. This new SAP Readiness Check scenario provides customers and their partners with insightful information on how SAP APO is used today.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By analysing active SAP APO modules, SAP Readiness Check for SAP Supply Chain solutions supports the definition of the target solution architecture.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="APO grafic.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/266774i05913EB77983FD9B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="APO grafic.png" alt="APO grafic.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Readiness Check for SAP Supply Chain solutions provides customers, implementation partners, and SAP consultants visibility on how the existing SAP APO modules, like SAP APO Demand Planning, SAP APO Supply Network Planning, SAP APO Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling, and Global Available-to-Promise, are implemented, tailored, and consumed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unlike the existing verification points presented by SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA, where the checks reveal “must-dos” in support of a possible conversion project to SAP S/4HANA, SAP Readiness Check for SAP Supply Chain solutions is purely informative and is intended to be used as input for discussions between customers, their partners, and SAP to identify the best-fitting target architecture,&amp;nbsp;as well as to help scope initial effort estimations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is SAP Integrated Business Planning (SAP IBP)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Integrated Business Planning (SAP IBP) solution is a cloud-based supply chain planning solution that scales to accommodate business growth and integrates with other SAP and third-party systems. It integrates key aspects of the planning process, including demand, supply, inventory, and sales and operations planning (S&amp;amp;OP). Designed to help you streamline planning and improve performance, SAP IBP supports data-driven decision-making and simplified collaboration to increase operational efficiency. SAP IBP delivers this with the help of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and powerful optimisation algorithms that enable real-time visibility, better forecasting, and faster decision-making across the entire supply chain.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For further information, check the &lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/integrated-business-planning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Integrated Business Planning Community&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supply chain planning &lt;SPAN&gt;functionality available in SAP S/4HANA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA ePPDS &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA offers Embedded PP/DS, which brings the SAP APO capabilities into the SAP ERP core. Embedded PP/DS brings many advantages, such as simplified master data maintenance, simplified integration, and planning PP/DS materials in MRP Live. &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The major innovation, however, is related to the user interface with SAP Fiori apps for capacity monitoring and capacity leveling. The SAP Fiori app &lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor Capacity Utilization&lt;/STRONG&gt; provides an overview of the capacity load in the resources assigned to the area of responsibility and a detailed capacity overview of a selected resource, including charts and additional details of the capacity load.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For further information, see &lt;A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2019/01/15/s4hana-embedded-ppds-shift-maintenance-in-monitor-capacity-fiori-app./" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;S/4HANA Embedded PP/DS: Shift Maintenance in Monitor Capacity Fiori App. | SAP Blogs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA aATP &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Advanced Available-to-Promise (aATP) is a business function in&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;that responds to order fulfillment requests in&amp;nbsp;Sales&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Production Planning. &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;An order fulfillment request consists of the required material, plant, requested quantity, and material availability date. The response to the request is based on the current stock situation,&amp;nbsp; future stock receipts, and real-time orders. &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Furthermore, additional restrictions can be applied based on other order attributes (like region or customers). The ATP function generates confirmation proposals for the requested material and plant, including confirmed quantities and dates.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For further information, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/f132c385e0234fe68ae9ff35b2da178c/a004ec57a7b5bc12e10000000a4450e5.html?version=2020.000&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Advanced Available-to-Promise (aATP) | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Readiness Check for SAP Supply Chain solutions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Overview&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The dashboard contains the following three tiles:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Master Data&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Shows a summary of active SAP SCM master data components, their identified dependent levels, and the corresponding data volumes in the analyzed system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Key Data by Application Area&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Provides insights into the key data of the different SCM components used in the analyzed system. &lt;SPAN&gt;This analysis can help to define the target system architecture and the main processes to be activated.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;System Configuration Settings&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Offers a summary of the main settings active in the analyzed system to identify requirements for the future solution architecture.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SCM_dashboard.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/266809i1B178D85B2A2972A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SCM_dashboard.png" alt="SCM_dashboard.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Master Data&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The Master Data tile provides the top 6 objects, while the detail view provides insights into all active objects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="master data.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/266789iD8FA10A307EEC23F/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="master data.png" alt="master data.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The detail view shows the active master data objects and the number of entries, together with additional details like table name, number of objects created last year, and number of user-created objects over the past year.

The note provides detailed and technical information on how to set up and perform the analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Initiate program RC_SCM_COLLECT_ANALYSIS_DATA via transaction SA38 or SE38 to initialize the data collectors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="collect.png" style="width: 526px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/266796iC55D383C4A97C4D1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="collect.png" alt="collect.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select the scope of the analysis by activating or deactivating the corresponding checkboxes. Use the &lt;EM&gt;Schedule Analysis &lt;/EM&gt;button to schedule the data collection. The process runs as a background job to avoid timeout issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The runtime of the data collectors depends on many factors, like server capacity, data volumes, and component usage. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the runtime. The data collection process was intentionally designed to avoid contention or interference with production workloads; consequently, you may see longer than expected runtimes. The best way to forecast the runtime for a production system is to conduct the data collection process in a copy of production using a similar hardware configuration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the analysis has finished, you can download the results to your local filesystem using the &lt;EM&gt;Download Analysis Data&lt;/EM&gt; button. The generated data collection archive is a ZIP file containing multiple XML files. All collected data is human-readable and can be easily inspected with appropriate XML viewers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Launch the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/readinesscheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Readiness Check cloud application on SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt; or from within your SAP Cloud ALM tenant and choose &lt;STRONG&gt;Start New Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt; to upload the ZIP archive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;After a few seconds, the results of the newly created SAP Readiness Check analysis can be explored.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As always, we look forward to receiving your feedback!&lt;BR /&gt;Your SAP Readiness Check Team&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Organizations planning a transition to SAP S/4HANA require comprehensive tools that offer insights into their existing SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC) systems. The Organizational Structure Profile within SAP Readiness Check for SAP ERP Usage and Data Profiling serves this purpose. Today, we proudly announce the availability of the new version of the Organizational Structure Profile as part of SAP Readiness Check for SAP ERP Usage and Data Profiling. We deliver significantly enhanced analysis features in this latest version, providing better clarity, deeper analytical capabilities, and a more user-friendly interface.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 1: Updated Version of the Organizational Structure Profile" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267110i0E8981FB34A79AD6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure1.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Updated Version of the Organizational Structure Profile" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 1: Updated Version of the Organizational Structure Profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1731374089"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Understanding the Business Context&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Organizational Structure Profile provides a holistic overview of an organization's SAP ECC 6.0 system structure. This profile is essential for understanding the relationships between various organizational units and identifying opportunities for optimization before transitioning to SAP S/4HANA. The Organizational Structure Profile automates a previously manual and resource-intensive process, enabling organizations to reduce the time and cost associated with scoping and assessing organizational objects.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The enhancements in this new version address several shortcomings of the previous version, including:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Limited scope:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; The previous version lacked coverage for certain organizational items (e.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;., controlling areas, storage locations, distribution channels, etc.), preventing a comprehensive analysis.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Lack of relationship data:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; The absence of explicit relationship data hindered a complete understanding of organizational dynamics.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Simplistic user interface:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Users were unable to efficiently access and interact with detailed and interconnected information due to a flat and feature-limited user interface.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The latest version addresses these shortcomings, transforming the Organizational Structure Profile into a more robust and insightful tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1534860584"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Capabilities of the Enhanced Organizational Structure Profile&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1467429798"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Expanded Scope and Coverage of Organizational Item Types&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The updated version significantly broadens its scope by including additional organizational item types essential for a comprehensive understanding of the organizational structure. These include:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Controlling Areas&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cost Centers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Profit Centers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Company Codes&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Plants&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Shipping Points&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Storage Locations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Purchasing Organizations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sales Organizations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Distribution Channels&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Divisions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This expanded coverage gives organizations a holistic view of their structure, ensuring that all relevant organizational elements are considered and more thoroughly examined during the transition. This insight allows project teams to make informed decisions during the transition planning phase.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1270916293"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enhanced Visualization of Organizational Relationships&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This new version offers improved visualization capabilities to clarify the complex relationships between organizational items. These include:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hierarchical network graphs:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Graphical representations display parent (ancestor) and child relationships, clearly visualizing organizational hierarchies.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Color-coded structures&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Different organizational types are represented with distinct colors, improving the clarity and usability of network visualizations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Expandable/collapsible elements:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Network components can expand and collapse, allowing users to focus on specific areas of interest within the organizational structure.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 2: The Parent Object and Child Object Network Graphs of a Sales Organization Item" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267111iE7F8BE51A4C86F40/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure2.jpg" alt="Figure 2: The Parent Object and Child Object Network Graphs of a Sales Organization Item" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 2: The Parent Object and Child Object Network Graphs of a Sales Organization Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These advanced visualization capabilities facilitate a more intuitive understanding of organizational structures and interdependencies, empowering project teams to make well-informed decisions during transition planning.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1074402788"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Detailed Usage Analysis for Making Informed Decisions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The enhancements include incorporating detailed usage analysis to help organizations quickly identify actively used organizational items and those that may be obsolete. Historically, determining whether an organizational unit is actively contributing to business processes or is no longer relevant is time-consuming. This new version now simplifies this process with advanced usage indicators, enabling teams to streamline assessments, accelerate decision-making based on usage data, and optimize resources by eliminating obsolete elements. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To evaluate the usage status of an organizational item, related business objects for all organizational item types in scope were identified and are used to analyze their data volumes and activities regarding the selected organization. The resulting data for these business objects are presented in the "Usage Indicator" card of the detail view (see &lt;/SPAN&gt;figure 3&lt;SPAN&gt;). Each business object is assigned a usage status, categorized as "Active," "Likely Not Active," or "Not Active":&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Active (Green):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Indicates that the business object is currently actively used for the organizational item in focus, having a data volume higher than 20 items and recent activity over the last three years.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Likely Not Active (Yellow):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;States that the usage status of this business object is uncertain about the selected organizational item, with limited data volumes or lack of recent activity, warranting further investigation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Not Active (Red):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Confirms that the business object is not being used for the selected organizational item, with a data volume less than 20 items and no recent activity over the last three years.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Based on the usage indicators of the related business objects, the usage status of the selected organizational item is determined and presented in the header of the detail view (see figure 3):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Active (Green):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;The organizational item is currently actively used. It has at least one related business object which is actively used.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Likely Not Active (Yellow):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;The usage status of the selected organizational item is ambiguous, demanding further investigation. No related business object is actively used, but there are objects with usage status "Likely Not Active" and/or "Not Active."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Not Active (Red):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;The organizational item is not being used. All related business objects have the usage indicator value "Not Active."&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For a more detailed understanding of calculating usage indicators, click on the 'Learn More' button to access the Organizational Structure Profile help panel.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 3: Detail View of a Plant Organizational Item, Including Usage Indicators Card and Open Help Panel" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267112i42858ADE1458EA5B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure3.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Detail View of a Plant Organizational Item, Including Usage Indicators Card and Open Help Panel" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 3: Detail View of a Plant Organizational Item, Including Usage Indicators Card and Open Help Panel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We strongly recommend that the project team, particularly the business owners of the involved organizational units, conduct further investigations to validate and confirm the findings from the usage data analysis. This additional validation ensures the accuracy and reliability of the insights, facilitating more informed decision-making.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-877889283"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Identification of Orphaned Organizational Items&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The enhanced version automatically identifies, and flags orphaned organizational items that lack proper parent-child hierarchy links, signaling potential structural inefficiencies or errors. By highlighting these gaps, the Organizational Structure Profile enables organizations to address structural inconsistencies proactively, minimize transition risks, and ensure the integrity and completeness of their organizational model throughout the transition process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 4: A Plant Without a Corresponding Company Code is Marked as an Orphaned Item" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267113iBD90ED0BFE26220A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure4.jpg" alt="Figure 4: A Plant Without a Corresponding Company Code is Marked as an Orphaned Item" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 4: A Plant Without a Corresponding Company Code is Marked as an Orphaned Item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-681375778"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Redesigned User Interface for Enhanced Usability&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To address usability concerns, the enhanced Organizational Structure Profile features a completely redesigned user interface that significantly improves usability:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Flexible column layout:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; The interface is divided into two main sections - a list of organizational items on the left and detailed information about the selected item on the right.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intuitive filtering:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Users can filter organizational items by type through a view selector or search for specific items using a text-based search field.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Detailed information sections&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: The detail view includes:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Master data information&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Usage indicators showing the status of related business objects&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Dependent data sections displaying related organizational items&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Network graphs visualizing parent and child hierarchies&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Export capabilities:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Users can export both the list of organizational items and detailed information about specific items for further analysis or reporting.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Related data access:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Links to related data collectors enable users to access additional information relevant to the selected organizational item type.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Figure 5: Detail View of a Company Code Organizational Item and Available Filter Options" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/267114iD9D8DA3CE6A99A68/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Figure5.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Detail View of a Company Code Organizational Item and Available Filter Options" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 5: Detail View of a Company Code Organizational Item and Available Filter Options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This newly designed user interface makes it easier for project teams to navigate and analyze complex organizational structures without requiring specialized knowledge.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-484862273"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cross-Profile Integration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The enhanced Organizational Structure Profile integrates seamlessly with other profiles within the SAP Readiness Check for SAP ERP Usage and Data Profiling:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Usage indicators are linked to the Initial Data Migration Profile, allowing users to navigate directly to detailed information about related business objects. This integration provides a more holistic view of the system landscape and facilitates comprehensive analysis.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hyperlinks to related data collectors enable users to access additional information and gain a more comprehensive understanding of their system landscape.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 6: A Company Code Organizational Item and its Collection of Links to Related Data Collectors" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/266923i5B8D98604A5908E3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture 6.png" alt="Figure 6: A Company Code Organizational Item and its Collection of Links to Related Data Collectors" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 6: A Company Code Organizational Item and its Collection of Links to Related Data Collectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-159266049"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Use Cases&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Transitioning to SAP S/4HANA can be more than just a data migration exercise - it could be a strategic opportunity to optimize business structures and eliminate inefficiencies.

Then, using the newly created data collection archive, update the existing analysis data using the&amp;nbsp;Update Analysis&amp;nbsp;option within the header of the dashboard view in the&amp;nbsp;SAP Readiness Check&amp;nbsp;cloud application on &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/readinesscheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt; or your SAP Cloud ALM tenant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As always, we look forward to receiving your feedback.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Readiness Check team&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Dear all,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Readiness Check has evolved over the last years to become a vital planning tool for the most critical SAP transformation journeys. Currently, SAP Readiness Check includes support for nine scenarios and has processed over 85,000 analyses since its inception in 2019.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With our continuously growing number of SAP Readiness Check scenarios, we felt it was time to revamp the SAP Readiness Check cloud application landing page. We are happy to provide you with a restructured landing page in SAP for Me and SAP Cloud ALM, offering easy navigation and orientation at first glance, and being the one-stop shop for all things related to SAP Readiness Check.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="LandingPage.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/272312i8D0D62DD2FD43D1D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="LandingPage.jpg" alt="LandingPage.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Getting Started&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; section contains the &lt;EM&gt;How to Start&lt;/EM&gt; link, which opens a guided procedure explaining the steps to create a new SAP Readiness Check analysis.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="HowToStart-1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/272314iB738C8CD86B2FC85/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="HowToStart-1.jpg" alt="HowToStart-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Familiarize yourself with the steps to prepare for creating your first SAP Readiness Check analysis.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Supported Scenarios&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; section contains links to the central guidance note for each SAP Readiness Check scenario. Each SAP Note lists the requirements to implement and run the SAP Readiness Check data collectors for the specific scenario in your system. Please read the respective SAP Note carefully before scheduling the data collection job; it contains essential hints to avoid long-running data collection jobs and other valuable information.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After the data collection jobs finish, you can create a new analysis by uploading the generated data archive to the SAP Readiness Check landing page. To do so, click &lt;EM&gt;Create New Analysis&lt;/EM&gt; in the top right corner of the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Analyses&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; section.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AnalysesTile.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/272316i5F5B1E8CE734AF5D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="AnalysesTile.jpg" alt="AnalysesTile.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enter a name for the analysis, verify your customer information, and select the results archive from your local filesystem. Accept the Terms of Use and decide if you want to authorize SAP employees access to your results.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note: With the &lt;EM&gt;Authorization&lt;/EM&gt; checkbox, you grant SAP employees access to your SAP Readiness Check results. Alternatively, you can grant individual access to specific e-mail addresses later within the analysis dashboard.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="CreateAnalysis.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/272317iA0C3CA2137F1C1B7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="CreateAnalysis.jpg" alt="CreateAnalysis.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clicking &lt;EM&gt;Create&lt;/EM&gt;, the application immediately processes the provided data collection archive file and produces a new analysis, accessible as an interactive dashboard. You can select the analysis from the list and start reviewing the results.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The list of analyses can be expanded by selecting the &lt;EM&gt;Show All&lt;/EM&gt; button in the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Analyses&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; section, which will display all analyses your user is authorized to access. Within the analysis list, you may search for an analysis or use the filter options to limit the view to a specific scenario or analysis status. In addition, you can create a list of favorite analyses.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New feature: Combined Scenarios&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AnalysisList.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/272319iB78DA17376467A67/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="AnalysisList.jpg" alt="AnalysisList.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Released with the new SAP Readiness Check cloud application landing page, you can now combine analyses of different scenarios for the same system and client. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For instance, you can now update an existing SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA analysis with the data collection archive produced by SAP Readiness Check for SAP ERP Usage and Data Profiling and/or SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors Solutions for the same system and client. Similarly, you can update an SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA Upgrades analysis with the data collection archive produced by SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors Solutions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To combine analyses, use the &lt;EM&gt;Update Analysis &lt;/EM&gt;button within an existing SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA or SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA Upgrades analysis to add the additional scenario. The resulting combined analysis includes a tab for each scenario within the dashboard header.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="CombinedAnalysis.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/272320i6210751166BE0444/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="CombinedAnalysis.jpg" alt="CombinedAnalysis.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What’s New&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; section of the SAP Readiness Check landing page always shows the latest blogs from the SAP Readiness Check Community to keep you up-to-date on new scenarios, features, and enhancements. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Additional Information&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; section provides links to the SAP Help Portal, SAP Community, learning areas, SAP Activate, related topics, and recommended training material.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We hope you enjoy the new look and feel!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;If you're planning an upgrade to SAP S/4HANA, the SAP Readiness Check is a valuable tool to help you assess your system's current state and identify any potential issues before the upgrade.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An accurate Readiness Check analysis starts with collecting important system information—such as usage statistics, custom code analysis, and configuration details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This information is gathered using data collectors, which are ABAP-based tools that extract relevant data from your SAP system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To set up the data collectors, refer to the SAP Notes outlined in the section below for step-by-step instructions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1: System preparation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before implementing the required SAP Notes for the data collectors, make sure the following Notes are already applied in their latest versions:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Note 1668882 – &lt;SPAN&gt;Note Assistant: Important notes for SAP_BASIS 730,731,740,750,751,752,753,754,755,756,757,758&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Note 2971435 – SNOTE – Delta calculation issue when 'mod unit' positions are changed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These Notes help ensure your system is up to date and minimize the risk of errors during setup.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To make the implementation process easier, you can use the Note Analyzer tool available in the Note Assistant.&amp;nbsp;For instructions and the input file, refer to SAP Note 3365856 – Note Analyzer Input File for SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA upgrades.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="892px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="75.225px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2758146&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="123.9px"&gt;SAP Readiness Check Framework&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="60.95px"&gt;SV-SCS-S4R&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="235.988px"&gt;RC_COLLECT_ANALYSIS_DATA&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="395.138px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;If SAP Note 2310438 has been implemented previously, it must be reverted prior to implementing SAP Note 2758146.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="75.225px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2399707&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="123.9px"&gt;Simplification Item Relevance &amp;amp; Compatibility Scope&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="60.95px"&gt;CA-TRS-PRCK&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="235.988px"&gt;TMW_RC_SITEM_DATA_COLL&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="395.138px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enables simplification item relevance, compatibility scope analysis, and target S/4HANA version selection in RC_COLLECT_ANALYSIS_DATA. Implementation is mandatory. SAP Note 2502552 and the consistency check from this note are optional but recommended.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="75.225px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2903677&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="123.9px"&gt;Effort Drivers for Simplification Items&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="60.95px"&gt;CA-TRS-PRCK&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="235.988px"&gt;TMW_RC_EFD_DATA_COLL&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="395.138px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This SAP Note offers the ability to include the effort driver analysis for simplification items with the initial effort ranking of&amp;nbsp;Potentially High. The result is that effort ranking for some simplification items could be recalculated based on the scope and complexity of the system being analyzed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="75.225px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2502552&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="123.9px"&gt;Consistency Check for Simplification Items&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="60.95px"&gt;CA-TRS-PRCK&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="235.988px"&gt;TMW_RC_SITEM_DATA_COLL&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="395.138px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This SAP Note enables the optional data collection process for the consistency check. If you opt to include this data in your analysis, please ensure that you always use the latest version of this SAP Note. It is an addition to SAP Note&amp;nbsp;2399707. You must read and implement SAP Note&amp;nbsp;2399707&amp;nbsp;first and follow all steps, including the implementation of related SAP Notes listed in SAP Note&amp;nbsp;2399707.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="75.225px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3061414&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="123.9px"&gt;Integration Analysis&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="60.95px"&gt;SV-SMG-MON-BPM-DCM&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="235.988px"&gt;–&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="395.138px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This SAP Note details the steps required to enable successful execution of the Integration check data collectors.
