    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1860425126"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please keep an eye on the current state of SAP’s &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/grounding?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Grounding service&lt;/A&gt;, as it will receive updates implementing Multi-modal RAG features in the future. For the extraction of structured data only, you might also want to consider using SAP’s &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/document-information-extraction?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Document Information Extraction service&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1405746183"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;As the applicability of generative AI in different use cases is being tested and researched every day at SAP, many new approaches are implemented to be proven possible and reliable. While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is less of a new topic in this context, its utility remains highly variable, depending on the data types that the respective documents contain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog outlines how a multi-modal RAG approach was successfully implemented as part of a proof-of-concept (PoC) for one of SAP’s customers, therefore fulfilling the reoccurring customer need for an AI assistant with the ability to interpret image content. We will focus on how the multi-modal RAG works, as it’s leveraging several SAP services, just as custom-built approaches.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1209232678"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business situation &amp;amp; challenge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;To begin with, we will look at the business situation and the resulting challenges at hand. In this case, an insurance company faced the challenge of handling a high volume of repetitive requests from business users concerning various systems and applications, with differing levels of complexity and detail. The company operates an implementation of one of SAP’s standard LoB solutions, enhanced by its own custom extensions. These extensions are thoroughly documented, using text, graphics, and diagrams to convey key information. However, the IT support team continues to struggle with overload and availability issues, as users often submit questions directly rather than consulting the available manuals. Additionally, similar business requests are repeatedly submitted by different business users and handled separately by various IT team members. This fragmented approach leads to significant inefficiencies and contributes to the IT team’s overload. Looking at these challenges, we saw the potential for an AI solution to enhance the efficiency of business support and consulting.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1012719173"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implemented solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;To realize this potential, we developed an AI-driven partner for instant support, relieving a lot of the IT team’s workload by answering said business requests.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As mentioned in the beginning of this blog, this project was executed as a PoC, exploring a solution that efficiently manages recurring business requests by leveraging AI capabilities. This involves a web application on the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform&lt;/A&gt; (SAP BTP), utilizing technologies such as the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/generative-ai-hub-in-sap-ai-core-7db524ee75e74bf8b50c167951fe34a5?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Generative AI Hub&lt;/A&gt; in &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI Core&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/developing-sap-hana-in-cloud-foundry-environment?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP HANA Cloud’s&lt;/A&gt; &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Vector Engine&lt;/A&gt; to provide enriched support content and timely responses, ultimately alleviating IT strain and enhancing service availability. Responses are based on the extension manuals, which include both text and images that need to be interpreted to generate reliable answers. While plain text and tables are easily retrievable and result in (...mostly ^^) reliable answers, pictures, diagrams and dashboards present a challenge when trying to generate document-based responses – this is where the multi-modal RAG comes into play. To clarify the scope of our solution, it should be stated that we did not implement functionality for detecting or processing tables, as tables were not part of the provided documents.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-816205668"&gt;Technical Architecture&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before we dive into the workflow of our multi-modal RAG solution, let’s take a quick look at the Architecture of the web application which implements the &lt;A href="https://architecture.learning.sap.com/docs/ref-arch/e5eb3b9b1d/3" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;RAG Reference Architecture&lt;/A&gt; on &lt;A href="https://architecture.learning.sap.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Architecture Center&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="maxlienhardt_0-1748332295064.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/266332i4D356FAE077434C7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="maxlienhardt_0-1748332295064.png" alt="maxlienhardt_0-1748332295064.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The web application is built on SAP BTP, running on its Cloud Foundry Runtime, thereby ensuring scalability and managed infrastructure. We used the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) to develop the backend services and Use Case Logic, utilizing LLM Plugins, SDKs and the SAP Cloud SDK for AI which are important for our multi-modal RAG purposes. The CAP application accesses the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/generative-ai-hub-in-sap-ai-core-7db524ee75e74bf8b50c167951fe34a5?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Generative AI Hub&lt;/A&gt; in &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI Core&lt;/A&gt; via &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Generative AI Hub SDK&lt;/A&gt;, harnessing Generative AI capabilities in a model-agnostic way. In our case, we use gpt-4o which acts as an agent and is one of two nodes in a simple &lt;A href="https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/high_level/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;langgraph&lt;/A&gt;, the other node being used to invoke our agent tools. Speaking of &lt;EM&gt;multiple&lt;/EM&gt; tools here is not accurate though, as we exclusively invoke our multi-modal RAG as a tool for the agent to access. Having an agent only using a single tool might seem absurd but it turns out that for some rather complex questions, the agent will still break things down into multiple invocations of the same tool (with different queries) and then combine the answers together in a final step. – we will go into the further details of that when talking about the multi-modal RAG approach in a moment. Frontend wise, &lt;A href="https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;UI5 Web Components&lt;/A&gt; was used to build the User Interface, which we deploy at a &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-standard-edition/sap-build-work-zone-standard-edition/create-html5-url-app?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;HTML5 App Repo&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-619692163"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-modal RAG&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now that we have outlined the overall application architecture, let’s get to the interesting part! Keep in mind that one of the main challenges we are faced with is interpreting the images contained in our documents to retrieve &lt;EM&gt;all &lt;/EM&gt;the relevant information when necessary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When designing a multi-modal RAG pipeline, one must evaluate and choose among several approaches. As shown in this &lt;A href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/cookbook/Multi_modal_RAG.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/A&gt; published by LangChain, we saw three possible options on how to build our RAG pipeline. While the LangChain documentation provides a general overview of how to implement this approach, we will delve deeper into the specifics of our solution to highlight technical details and differences to the LangChain approach:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="maxlienhardt_1-1748332507340.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/266336i8E7449B2C28EB8BA/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="maxlienhardt_1-1748332507340.png" alt="maxlienhardt_1-1748332507340.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As you can see, we do a lot of preprocessing for the documents before putting them in our database to fetch them at runtime. Naturally, we will first take a look at what’s happening at design time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, all the images contained in the pdfs are extracted using the &lt;A href="https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;python fitz library&lt;/A&gt;. The images are then fed to the LLM, which is instructed to generate descriptions of said images (as explained earlier, the LLM access happens via &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP/ai-sdk-js" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Generative AI Hub SDK&lt;/A&gt;). In a subsequent step, the images in the documents are replaced with their generated description and a reference to the image itself. Ultimately, the plain text - containing image descriptions and references – is chunked with &lt;A href="https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/experimental/text_splitter/langchain_experimental.text_splitter.SemanticChunker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;LangChain’s semantic chunker&lt;/A&gt; and embedded using &lt;A href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-ada-002" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;text-embedding-ada-002&lt;/A&gt;, which is consumed via Generative AI Hub SDK. Those embeddings are stored together with the original text and images in HANA Cloud’s Vector storage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At runtime, every user query is embedded (again, using text-embedding-ada002). The Vector Engine performs a &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide/performing-similarity-searches?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;similarity search&lt;/A&gt; on the stored document embeddings, compares them to the embedded user query and picks the ten most similar chunks, just as the next chunk in front of and behind each of them. Since LLMs have a limit on the number of images they can accept as input, we must overcome this limitation when the context to be provided to the LLM includes more images than supported. We do so by passing in image descriptions for the extra images (coming from chunks with lesser relevance) instead of their actual image data. As depicted in the multi-modal RAG diagram above, the stored original text for each chunk is then,&amp;nbsp;together with all the base64-encoded image data and potential image descriptions, given to the LLM for it to generate an answer. &lt;SPAN&gt;That way we can ensure that the LLM includes relevant information contained in the images just as reliably as if we retrieved text only.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;In other words:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;the LLM doesn't usually rely on image descriptions as its main source of information. That only tends to happen when the number of images exceeds the model’s processing limits. Typically, the input includes both the stored text and base64-encoded images within each chunk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-423178658"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We hope that this blog has given you a better understanding of how a custom-built multi-modal RAG application can look like. With our PoC we aim to take a step towards increased AI utility, exploring and enhancing existing techniques of combined text and image retrieval to set ground for future projects and upcoming SAP services. Implementing this solution enables users to interact with complex, document-based content in a natural way by combining text and visual information to generate context-aware, AI-powered answers that go beyond traditional RAG usage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking forward to future research on new ways of implementing and enhancing multi-modal RAG, we invite you to ask questions and discuss on this topic in the comment section of this blog. Glad we got you hooked until the end! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, a big thank you to the entire team – &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/217056"&gt;@adi_pleyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/41578"&gt;@kay&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;Vikas Thimmiaha,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1455508"&gt;@Jackson7&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1416066"&gt;@RobinP&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1673160"&gt;@GerdBuchmueller&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1517390"&gt;@andriysobolsap&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1626343"&gt;@g_kevorkian&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; and &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1775468"&gt;@ababalau&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- for your outstanding work and collaboration throughout this PoC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP SuccessFactors continues to embed AI capabilities across its key modules- Performance &amp;amp; Goals Management, Succession &amp;amp; Development Planning, and Talent Intelligence Hub, aiming to improve HR efficiency and decision-making. However, alongside these promising functionalities, real-world usage reveals notable challenges and limitations HR leaders must consider.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Based on my expertise, this blog mentions AI functionalities in only a few SAP SuccessFactors modules—PMGM, SPCDP, and TIH.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;FONT size="4" color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI in Performance &amp;amp; Goals Management (PMGM): Efficiency Meets Alignment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The latest AI-driven innovation in PMGM includes generative AI that helps draft personalized, aligned employee goals quickly, reducing administrative workload. Additionally, AI analyzes continuous feedback and performance data to provide managers with insights into employee trends and development needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Reality Check: PMGM's AI Goal Creation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Week 1: Users are amazed by the speed&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Week 2: Managers notice that AI-generated goals sound similar across teams; goals feel “robotic.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Week 3:&amp;nbsp; Few AI-created goals are technically correct but practically purposeless, and most&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;goals do not align with organizational strategy. As a result, Managers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;and HR spend time editing AI-generated goals instead of creating them&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Consultant’s Fix&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;AI-generated goals often require human review to ensure relevance and alignment with team dynamics. Overreliance on AI can lead to generic or misaligned objectives that fail to motivate employees. &lt;STRONG&gt;Use AI as your first draft, not your final answer.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Think of it as having a very efficient intern who still needs supervision.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;FONT size="4" color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Succession &amp;amp; Development Planning (SPCDP): Data-Driven Yet Human-Centric&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;AI in SPCDP supports data-driven succession decisions by assessing potential successors' skills, experience, and readiness. It also recommends personalized career development paths and learning opportunities tailored to individual skill gaps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Reality Check&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;AI confidently recommends a high-performing individual contributor for a leadership role, completely missing the fact that this person had zero interest in management. The AI saw the skills match but it missed the human factor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Three Questions AI Can’t Answer (Yet)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Does this person actually want the role? AI sees potential, not passion&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;How will they handle the pressure? Performance under stress isn’t in the algorithm&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Do they fit the team culture? Soft skills remain frustratingly soft for AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;While AI provides objective successor ratings and development suggestions, these outputs depend heavily on data quality and contextual interpretation by HR professionals. AI recommendations can miss cultural fit or individual aspirations if treated as prescriptive rather than advisory. Organizations must balance AI insights with human judgment to avoid rigid or ineffective succession plans.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Consultant’s Fix&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use AI insights as your starting point for conversations, not your end point for decisions&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The suggestions should guide, but not replace, human decisions. Career insights work better for junior roles than senior positions. Career insights help plan learning paths, but they must align with company culture and employee goals to be effective.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;FONT size="4" color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Talent Intelligence Hub (TIH): Precision in Skills Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;TIH’s AI now focuses on recent job roles to keep skills data accurate. It recommends learning based on skill levels and improves team visibility for managers. AI-driven learning suggestions help employees focus their development. Workflow updates add control over skill approvals, helping maintain clean data. This holistic view, powered by AI, helps organizations not only fill current roles but also anticipate future workforce trends and succession risks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Reality Check&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;TIH’s AI is like having a very enthusiastic research assistant who finds exactly what you asked for, even when it’s not what you need.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;For TIH, the foundational requirement for clean, structured data is a major barrier. Many organizations find their HR data inconsistent or disconnected, limiting AI effectiveness. Without significant data cleanup, AI-driven insights in TIH may be inaccurate or misleading.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;AI extracts every possible skill from job descriptions, creating overly large skill inventories that are difficult to manage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;AI suggests learning content for every skill gap, regardless of priority or relevance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Consultant’s Fix&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Skills extraction works best for technical roles with clear competency requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Learning recommendations are most effective for certification-based skills.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Ethical concerns around AI bias and transparency require ongoing governance and monitoring to maintain trust.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;FONT size="4" color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Strategic Takeaways for HR Leaders&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Use AI to automate tasks, but always apply human judgment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Keep data clean and governed for reliable AI results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Set clear, realistic goals for AI adoption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;FONT size="4" color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI in HR isn’t about replacing human judgment; it’s about giving humans better data to make judgment calls&lt;/STRONG&gt;. When you approach it that way, the technology becomes genuinely helpful rather than frustratingly inaccurate.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The future of HR technology isn’t about perfect AI—it’s about perfectly integrated AI that knows its place in human-centered processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;If you want to explore how to balance AI and human insight in your HR processes, feel free to reach out for guidance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thank you for taking the time to read.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You are welcome to express your views and ask any queries in the comment section of this blog.

Discover more in the full blog post and get ready for the future of enterprise AI.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1536733635"&gt;The Challenge&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let’s start by facing the current reality. Business processes in enterprises heavily rely on structured tabular data. When it comes to creating predictive insights from this data, our landscape today is fragmented and siloed. While SAP has developed robust AI services tailored for structured tabular data, such as Data Attribute Recommendation for classification and regression scenarios, Personalized Recommendations &lt;/SPAN&gt;delivering tailored user experiences and relevant content to support diverse business objectives and recommendation scenarios.&lt;SPAN&gt;, and embedded matching scenarios (like Cash Application), each solving specific challenges effectively, these services would benefit by harmonizing into a comprehensive, unified solution for customers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This structure has evolved naturally over time, resulting in each AI service possessing its distinct architecture and workflow. While these services are functional, SAP is actively enhancing them to streamline integration and simplify adoption for application developers. These ongoing improvements also pave the way for more rapid and seamless incorporation of cutting-edge innovations, such as the SAP Foundation Model, across our AI Services landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are excited to announce the introduction of &lt;STRONG&gt;tabular AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a significant step forward in advancing our AI capabilities. Tabular AI will serve two key objectives: first, to unify our existing AI services tailored for structured tabular data into a single, integrated platform, and second, to expedite the integration of groundbreaking AI research, particularly in the realm of generative AI, into our products. This strategic move is aimed at not only simplifying the technological landscape but also at propelling our offerings to the forefront of AI innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1340220130"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="TabularAIinaNutshell.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/278254i7BD96A3283EB8447/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="TabularAIinaNutshell.JPG" alt="TabularAIinaNutshell.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1143706625"&gt;Unification&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Tabular AI will unify all existing AI service offerings for structured tabular data under the umbrella of SAP’s Generative AI Hub, streamlining integration, lifecycle management, and accelerating implementation timelines. This comprehensive approach will democratize predictive AI capabilities, making them more accessible and easier to maintain. By doing so, business developers will be better equipped to effectively leverage these tools within their custom AI applications or embedded AI scenarios. As a result, business developers will be better equipped to leverage these tools in custom AI applications and embedded AI scenarios. For application developers, this unification means a simpler integration process, with a single service plan and service key required for their applications.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With this transformative change, the focus shifts from selecting a suitable AI solution for an application to concentrating directly on the desired AI functionality - be it classification, regression, matching, recommendation, or other capabilities that may emerge in the future. Notably, the inclusion of the matching capability represents a significant enhancement, as this functionality was not previously available through an existing AI service offering.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Moving forward, all these functionalities will be accessible through a unified entry point - the AI API. This consolidation simplifies the user experience and expedites the deployment of advanced AI capabilities, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate and apply these functionalities across various applications more efficiently without the challenges of managing multiple technologies or models. By eliminating barriers related to the technology stack and model selection, developers can more effectively concentrate on utilizing the precise functionality needed to add value in their specific contexts, thereby driving innovative use of AI across industries.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="TabularAIArchitecture.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/278255i27814E3C210287C0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="TabularAIArchitecture.JPG" alt="TabularAIArchitecture.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;However, tabular AI isn't just about simplifying the developer's experience; it also paves the way for seamless integration of future innovations. A prominent example is the SAP Foundation Model, leading us into the discussion of innovation. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-947193120"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Innovation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With tabular AI in place, we are seizing the opportunity to stay at the forefront of innovation. By unifying our architecture and workflow, Tabular AI enables the seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies and native adoption of new advancements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At launch, tabular AI will incorporate advanced AI models designed to deliver unprecedented levels of predictive insight and flexibility. Leveraging large-scale business data, these models will unlock a wealth of new use cases and transform the way users interact with our solutions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A key feature is the SAP Foundation Model, a table-native Transformer that brings adaptive, in-context learning to tabular AI. Unlike traditional models that require repeated training for each use case, the SAP Foundation Model provides on-the-fly predictions for individual records based on provided examples. This adaptability allows the model to respond dynamically to changing data without retraining, substantially simplifying the entire machine learning lifecycle and reducing operational complexity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customers will benefit from increased intelligence and automation in embedded scenarios, enabling faster, more accurate decision-making. Over time, this technology will supercharge a broad range of use cases across the SAP portfolio - streamlining business processes, increasing efficiency, and reducing manual effort.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Initially, this capability will support embedded classification and regression use cases within SAP applications. This focused rollout ensures high reliability while setting the stage for expanding to broader custom scenarios in the future.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="TabularAIUVP.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/278259iE5E04D1039628E26/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="TabularAIUVP.JPG" alt="TabularAIUVP.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-750679615"&gt;What's in for Me&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Looking ahead to 2025, our vision is to make AI for structured data both simpler and more powerful for everyone using SAP. With the upcoming launch of tabular AI as a flagship service within SAP’s Generative AI Hub, we are unifying and streamlining all our existing capabilities by consolidating features from Data Attribute Recommendation and Personalized Recommendation and introducing matching as a native capability. Tabular AI will serve as your one-stop shop for all predictive tasks involving structured business data, providing you with a seamless and integrated user experience.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We are also taking a significant step forward by embedding cutting-edge technology: Tabular AI will feature in-context learning powered by the SAP Foundation Model. This enables highly adaptive, context-aware predictions based on real-time examples—&lt;STRONG&gt;without requiring traditional, exhaustive retraining.&lt;/STRONG&gt; As your business data evolves, the model dynamically adapts, delivering relevant predictions and keeping pace with changing requirements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For the initial release of those advanced capabilities powered by the SAP Foundation Model, we are prioritizing embedded scenarios such as classification and regression tasks deeply integrated within SAP applications. By focusing on well-established use cases with proven business value, we can rigorously test and refine in-context learning, ensuring maximum reliability and robustness. This strategy will help us build a strong foundation for expanding advanced capabilities to broader and more customized scenarios in the future.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We are aiming to make tabular AI generally available in the second half of 2025.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-554166110"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="TabularAIRoadmap.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/278260i00B4DEDAAA96F5FC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="TabularAIRoadmap.JPG" alt="TabularAIRoadmap.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-357652605"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Next Steps on our Journey&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;All of this is, however, just the beginning. Looking ahead, we anticipate a transformational leap in how advanced AI models generate insights from linked business data. Rather than requiring each tabular AI scenario to be explicitly modeled at design time, we envision a future where users can easily obtain both simple and sophisticated insights through flexible, ad-hoc predictions that accommodate real-time data changes, extensions, user interactions, and feedback. This approach will ensure the most accurate and effective insights from your business data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These developments will also pave the way for the next generation of highly autonomous, agentic AI scenarios. Unlike today’s narrow AI models, future scenarios will support a broader range of execution and will benefit from precisely grounded insights, leveraging the foundation of structured tabular data for greater accuracy and reliability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In effect, we expect nothing less than a democratization of AI in the structured tabular space, where a massive growth of capabilities is fueled by empowering application developers and end users alike to generate targeted AI insights as easily and swiftly as writing prompts for textual tasks performed by an LLM. As these capabilities advance, generating insights with AI will become standard practice rather than an exception - until, eventually, almost every process will be AI-powered, with only a few remaining untouched.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As part of this evolution, we will begin to phase out and deprecate our legacy AI services. This move will fully realize the unification vision: A single, universal entry point for all AI capabilities supporting structured business data. Unifying our services brings several strategic benefits:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accelerated innovation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Features and updates reach you faster.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Streamlined integration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: New advancements can be incorporated seamlessly into the existing portfolio.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reduced total cost of ownership&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Consolidating offerings minimizes maintenance overhead, lowering costs and increasing overall value.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For customers currently leveraging Data Attribute Recommendation or Personalized Recommendation, rest assured that there is no immediate action required. Our top priority is to ensure your business processes continue uninterrupted. We’ll reach out proactively to facilitate a smooth transition to tabular AI and to support you every step of the way.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-161139100"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="TabularAIVision.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/278261i95E08CF7C50FFBDD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="TabularAIVision.JPG" alt="TabularAIVision.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--35374405"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Conclusion&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tabular AI marks a significant leap towards simplifying and unifying AI for structured business data at SAP. By consolidating existing AI services and introducing advanced AI capabilities like in-context learning through the SAP Foundation Model, we’re making predictive AI more powerful, accessible, and future-ready.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the initial focus is on embedded use cases, our long-term vision is a flexible, unified offering that adapts to evolving business needs and fosters innovation at scale. This transformation is more than a technical evolution - it’s an invitation to reimagine what’s possible with your data.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1733397986"&gt;Extending AI Capabilities: Diving Deeper with the MCP Trading Partner Management Server&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Following up on my previous article, "&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/using-integration-suite-with-the-power-of-ai/ba-p/14067293" target="_blank"&gt;Using Integration Suite with the Power of AI&lt;/A&gt;," where I showcased how to extend Integration Suite development with AI and the ModelContextProtocol (MCP), I'm excited to introduce a specialized enhancement: the **MCP Trading Partner Management (TPM) Server**.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the initial MCP Integration Suite Server provides broad tools for general CPI functions like Integration Flows and Message Mappings, many enterprise integration scenarios heavily rely on managing B2B relationships. This new server is purpose-built to give AI chat clients direct access to and control over the rich capabilities of SAP Integration Suite's Trading Partner Management. It makes sense to install both servers together to have access to both tools combined.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1536884481"&gt;What Can You Do With It? A Comprehensive Toolset&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The MCP Trading Partner Management Server empowers AI assistants with a wide array of tools to manage your B2B integration aspects. Here's an overview of its core capabilities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Trading Partner Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Create, retrieve, and manage trading partners, their systems, identifiers, communication channels, and even signature verification configurations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agreement Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Work with B2B agreements, including creation from templates, retrieving details, and managing their associated technical B2B scenarios and deployments.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Implementation Guideline (MIG) Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Access and manipulate MIGs, including inspecting nodes and fields, applying proposals, and creating new MIG drafts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mapping Guideline (MAG) Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Create mapping guidelines and test them with example data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitoring&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Search for interchanges, retrieve payload data, download specific payloads, and access error details for TPM message monitoring.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Other Utilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Get details on type systems, messages within them, create custom messages, and retrieve master data like business process roles, countries, and product classifications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1340370976"&gt;Setup and Configuration&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As with the previous server, I highly recommend using this tool with &lt;A href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cline&lt;/A&gt;, the VSCode extension, or any other MCP-compatible client.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This server requires **Java (version 17 or higher)** and **Gradle (version 8 or higher)** to be installed on your machine. Once you have these prerequisites, get started by cloning the project and building it:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/1nbuc/mcp-is-tpm.git
cd mcp-is-tpm
./gradlew build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Next, you'll need to add the MCP Trading Partner Management Server to your AI Client's MCP configuration. This is typically done alongside your existing `mcp-is` configuration to provide the full spectrum of tools. The `env` variables below should be configured with your SAP Integration Suite URL and user credentials.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note on Credentials:&lt;/STRONG&gt; If your S or P user is associated with a Universal ID, ensure you provide your Universal ID password and email (`CPI_UNIVERSAL_MAIL`). If you have a standalone S-User, simply omit the `CPI_UNIVERSAL_MAIL` variable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-is": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "&amp;lt;project path for mcp-integration-suite&amp;gt;/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "autoApprove": []
    },
    "mcp-is-tpm": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": [
        "-Dlogging.pattern.console=",
        "-Dspring.main.web-application-type=none",
        "-Dspring.ai.mcp.server.stdio=true",
        "-jar",
        "&amp;lt;project path for mcp-is-tpm&amp;gt;/app/build/libs/app-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
      ],
      "autoApprove": [],
      "env": {
        "CPI_URL": "https://your.cpi.url.hana.ondemand.com",
        "CPI_USER": "S001234567",
        "CPI_PASSWORD": "myPass123",
        "CPI_UNIVERSAL_MAIL": "mail@company.de"
      }
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Remember to replace `&amp;lt;project path for mcp-integration-suite&amp;gt;` and `&amp;lt;project path for mcp-is-tpm&amp;gt;` with the actual local paths to your cloned repositories.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For optimal interaction and to guide the AI effectively, I highly recommend starting each chat session with a &lt;A href="https://github.com/1nbuc/mcp-integration-suite?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-prompt" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;custom prompt&lt;/A&gt;, similar to the approach outlined in my previous blog post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1143857471"&gt;What Can You Actually Do With It? (Conceptual Examples)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the comprehensive toolset provided by the MCP Trading Partner Management Server, you can instruct your AI assistant to handle intricate TPM tasks. Here are a few conceptual examples:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1205509404"&gt;Example 1: Create new Partners and Communication with them&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;You are a fishing shop with SAP ERP and SAP Integration suite &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Here is a list of trading partners, look if they exist already otherwise create them.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Rod Supplier rody&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Fishermans port LLC&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Here is a list of transactions I do with partners. For every partnertransaction find a suitable Agreement template and create an agreement based on it.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;All partners use AS2.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;SAP Sustainability Control Tower (SCT) has introduced an out-of-the-box functionality, Generate ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reports with AI application. With the Generate ESG Reports with AI app, the ESG reporting process is automated across the selected periods. It uses the ESG data that has already been imported into SAP Sustainability Control Tower (SCT) and creates the reports based on the imported data. The AI generated reports are available to download in the .pdf format.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I will outline how to define the content for custom templates based on set of facts, i.e.,&amp;nbsp; available metrics or reference facts, and how to generate ESG reports by leveraging AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mini Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you want to understand the nitty-gritty of SAP Sustainability Control Tower(SCT) out-of-the-box functionalities and its Integration with SAP EHSM-EM (Emission Management), check-out my blog posts listed below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A title="European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/european-sustainability-reporting-standards-esrs-journey-with-sap/ba-p/13855117" target="_blank"&gt;European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A title="SAP Sustainability Control Tower-Import Greenhouse Gas Emissions from SAP EHS Environment Management" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/sap-sustainability-control-tower-import-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-sap/ba-p/13774005" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Sustainability Control Tower-Import Greenhouse Gas Emissions from SAP EHS Environment Management&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A title="Addendum to SAP Sustainability Control Tower-Import Greenhouse Gas Emissions from SAP EHSM-EM" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/addendum-to-sap-sustainability-control-tower-import-greenhouse-gas/ba-p/13872918" target="_blank"&gt;Addendum to SAP Sustainability Control Tower-Import Greenhouse Gas Emissions from SAP EHSM-EM&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A title="SAP Sustainability Control Tower(SCT) Metric Management-Basic Custom Metric &amp;amp;

Power&lt;/STRONG&gt;"&amp;nbsp; to generate an ESG report for the above imported data using the AI application.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ESG Report Template for Calcination &amp;amp;

option to set-up a tailored custom template for ESG metrics and reference facts.&amp;nbsp; For Instance, I have added sections and subsections to align with the ESG pillars to have the template structure. We can rename, remove the sections and subsections at any point of time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Sections and Subsections  of ESG report" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/281410i5D9BED584F087F54/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pardhasaradhi_Reddy_Chelikam_0-1751383333272.png" alt="Sections and Subsections  of ESG report" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Sections and Subsections  of ESG report&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, let us start filling the sections with the content. To add the text to the "carbon emissions profile" , I have built the content by adding "Reference Facts" and " Metrics". We can add maximum 30 facts for each section or subsection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pillar: Environment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pardhasaradhi_Reddy_Chelikam_1-1751383465037.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/281411iF6201C0C63884B18/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pardhasaradhi_Reddy_Chelikam_1-1751383465037.png" alt="Pardhasaradhi_Reddy_Chelikam_1-1751383465037.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can choose the "Reference facts" from the predefined facts, and metrics can be chosen from the available SAP provided quantitative metrics.

This marks a clear step into the era of Agentic AI – systems that can understand context, take initiative, and drive outcomes autonomously. “SAP combines the world’s most powerful suite of business applications with uniquely rich data and the latest AI innovations to create a flywheel of customer value,” &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2025/05/sap-business-ai-reimagine-how-enterprises-run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;said CEO Christian Klein&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. While this evolution opens exciting possibilities for automation and productivity, it also introduces a new layer of complexity in how we approach security. Agentic systems challenge traditional safeguards, making it essential to identify and mitigate risks early through tailored threat modeling.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At its core, threat modeling is about asking the right questions early in the development process, while the system is still being designed and built. Rather than simply looking for bugs or code flaws, it forces us to think through how a system might behave in the real world. What could go wrong if an agent’s goals are manipulated? Could someone poison its memory over time? What if an agent uses a tool in an unintended or unsafe way? How could agent-generated content be used to mislead or overload human decision-makers? What happens when agents collaborate or collide in ways that expose the system to cascading failures or manipulation?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These are not hypothetical questions. They reflect the real and emerging risks of agentic systems. The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;OWASP Agentic AI Threats &amp;amp; Mitigations Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; is a valuable resource that brings structure to this thinking. It highlights specific threats such as memory poisoning, cascading hallucinations, privilege compromise, and agent communication poisoning. For teams building these systems, it helps provide a common vocabulary and practical examples to guide threat modeling work.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To give an example of how threat modeling helps in practice, let’s take the case of goal manipulation – one of the emerging risks identified in the OWASP guide. In agentic systems, attackers don’t necessarily need to exploit traditional software flaws. Instead, they can attempt to influence an agent’s behavior over time by subtly manipulating its objectives. This might happen through indirect prompt injection, compromised data sources, or crafted tool responses. Imagine an agent responsible for prioritizing financial transactions; if adversarial inputs gradually shift its decision logic, it could start approving risky payments outside of the intended policy. In threat modeling exercises, we explore how such scenarios could play out by analyzing how the agent forms and updates its goals, how memory and feedback loops could reinforce undesired behaviors, and how downstream actions might be impacted. This helps define targeted mitigations, such as isolating goal-setting logic from external inputs, monitoring shifts in agent behavior, and adding human validation for sensitive decisions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The OWASP Agentic AI Threats &amp;amp; Mitigations Guide provides a helpful reference architecture that illustrates where these types of risks can emerge. The diagram below maps threats to key components in a typical agentic system, making it easier to visualize how threat modeling applies in practice.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="helenoakley_0-1752751657687.png" style="width: 844px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/287897iD3D301C81278E582/image-dimensions/844x449?v=v2" width="844" height="449" role="button" title="helenoakley_0-1752751657687.png" alt="helenoakley_0-1752751657687.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Image Source: OWASP Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations guide, “Threat Model Summary”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At SAP, threat modeling has long been part of our &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/03/a248a699-627c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Secure Software Development and Operations Lifecycle (Secure SDOL)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, which is certified under ISO 27001. This framework ensures security is built into every phase of the product lifecycle, from design to operations. With Agentic AI, we are expanding our threat modeling approach to address risks that don’t typically appear in traditional application security. This includes analyzing agent memory behavior, reasoning patterns, system autonomy, human interaction points, and the dynamics of multi-agent ecosystems. The focus shifts from identifying static vulnerabilities to understanding how autonomy and learning can lead to unintended behaviors. From there, we define appropriate controls and mitigations to reduce those risks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The field of Agentic AI security continues to take shape. Standards like ISO 42001 and regulations such as the EU AI Act are in development, and industry best practices are actively maturing. That’s why collaboration is essential. SAP is contributing to the conversations held with industry groups focused on these challenges, including &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://genai.owasp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;OWASP GenAI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; initiatives. We’re not just adopting ideas, we’re helping shape them, working with peers and regulators to advance the state of AI security. Our teams bring deep expertise in both enterprise security and AI systems, offering a perspective that’s helping guide how the broader ecosystem approaches agentic risks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Transparency remains central to how SAP approaches product security. As we continue evolving our work with AI, we’re committed to sharing what we learn through resources like the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Trust Center&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. Security is not a one-time effort. It is a continuous process, especially with systems as dynamic as Agentic AI.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Threat modeling helps us stay ahead of these evolving risks and supports the design of systems that are both capable and safe. As Agentic AI becomes more embedded in enterprise workflows, this kind of proactive thinking becomes essential.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP is proud to contribute to shaping the future of secure AI. By collaborating across the industry and applying deep expertise from our teams, we’re helping advance practical, forward-looking approaches to securing the next generation of intelligent systems.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

A key success criterion is the capacity to fully harness and derive value from organisational data. Many companies struggle with data problems, such as fragmented information, outdated systems, and the super important task of preparing data for emerging technologies like AI. Recognising these challenges, we are excited to introduce a blog series dedicated to showcasing the substantial business value of SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC) in the context of planning and analytics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The motivation behind this initiative is to provide a comprehensive exploration of how SAP BDC capabilities as essential instruments, facilitating robust strategic alignment and guiding effective decision-making processes across diverse organisational requirements. We aim to illustrate how SAP BDC, equipped with powerful data management, planning, analytics and innovative AI capabilities, empowers organisations with enhanced business steering agility by providing real-time insights, streamlined data management, and automated decision support – going from insights to action,&amp;nbsp;helps mainly leaders guide their businesses with precision.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Our blog series will provide valuable insights for decision-makers seeking to harness SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC) to enhance operational efficiency, optimise resource allocation, and achieve long-term objectives. By featuring detailed planning &amp;amp; analytics topics, the series will illustrate the transformative impact of SAP BDC in addressing the operational complexities of today’s business environment. This first introductory blog post will spotlight the strategic advantages of SAP BDC, particularly in the context of Business Steering, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of its benefits throughout the blog series.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;There are several blog posts in the series that will cover advantages of SAP BDC in the context of business steering, so please stay tuned for the upcoming blogs:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Value of SAP BDC in the context of business steering&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;(THIS BLOG POST)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/planning-amp-analytics-p-amp-a-is-an-essential-part-of-sap-business-data/ba-p/14223762" target="_self"&gt;Planning &amp;amp; Analytics is an essential part of SAP BDC&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/key-planning-amp-analytics-components-of-sap-business-data-cloud-bdc/ba-p/14238066" target="_self"&gt;Key Planning &amp;amp; Analytics components of SAP BDC&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is AI going to “retire” a dashboard?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Simulations, a game changer in today’s volatile world&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/financial-management-blog-posts-by-sap/extend-existing-planning-scenarios-of-sap-bpc-bw-ip-in-sap-bdc/ba-p/14234247" target="_self"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extend existing planning scenarios of SAP BPC/BW-IP in SAP BDC&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Real-time steering with LIVE planning&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;PaPM - The role of business calculation engine in business steering&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Self – service analytics and real time business steering&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Business steering powered by AI agents&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Leverage data products in the context of planning &amp;amp; forecasting&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Introducing AI/ML capabilities by SAP Databricks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1213943407"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CHALLENGES&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The current global market situation is characterised by heightened volatility and uncertainty, driven by factors such as geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and rapid technological advancements. In this dynamic environment businesses face significant challenges like supply chain disruptions, rising and uncontrolled operational costs and the need for digital transformation to remain competitive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Obviously, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to every challenge, but adopting a data-driven decision-making process provides significant advantages that can help organizations navigate complexities and respond more effectively to market dynamics. By relying on data to drive decisions, businesses can achieve greater accuracy and insight, which helps in identifying trends, understanding customer behaviours, and optimising operations. This approach enables companies to be more agile and responsive to changing conditions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Every leader today feels the weight of growing complexity. CFOs balancing growth and profitability. CHROs managing talent in an evolving workforce. CIOs modernising IT while keeping innovation alive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 2: Challenges by CXO persona" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/293403i70A352B1E9DEF090/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="CxO Challenges.png" alt="Picture 2: Challenges by CXO persona" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Picture 2: Challenges by CXO persona&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;But the true challenge lies in how these functions are increasingly interconnected. When one part of the business is disrupted, whether it’s a supply chain issue or a talent gap, the ripple effects are felt everywhere. To succeed, businesses need more than solutions for individual challenges, businesses need a way to align every function and unlock collective power.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Like Aristotle (apparently) once said: &lt;STRONG&gt;“THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS”&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Today’s complexity demands more than incremental fixes and silo apps/solutions. If we want to have benefits from AI and systems of agents collaborating across all functions, we need to have a solid foundation, where we can seamlessly combine applications, data, insights and AI into one ecosystem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Just picture this example around Financial Planning (incl. forecasting &amp;amp; simulation), where we can develop a comprehensive financial snapshot while automating workflow tasks through agentic AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 3: Forecasting  &amp;amp; Simulation  use case evolution" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/293404i7B72EE6205010DC9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Fin Use case.png" alt="Picture 3: Forecasting  &amp;amp; Simulation  use case evolution" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Picture 3: Forecasting  &amp;amp; Simulation  use case evolution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This is where we bring together all relevant data, like revenues, expenses, also across different scenarios, like actuals, plan &amp;amp; forecast. We also integrate all relevant external data, like different macro-economic KPIs, external market research data., etc. Based on identified key drivers/influencers of our business, we are going to define and perform different planning/forecasting scenarios. In the next step we are going to simulate and analyse impact of external drivers like inflation rate on our performance and identify the areas that will be impacted. Specialised analytics agent can propose potential mitigation strategies, like targeted promotions to drive customer demand, that can be further assessed &amp;amp; analysed. Based on this information we can decide for a certain course of actions that can be triggered by system of agents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 4: Risk analysis &amp;amp; mitigation strategies delivered by agentic AI" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/293405iB08BE4D80A063586/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SAC_Tarrifs.png" alt="Picture 4: Risk analysis &amp;amp; mitigation strategies delivered by agentic AI" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Picture 4: Risk analysis &amp;amp; mitigation strategies delivered by agentic AI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We can say with great confidence that our customers are not working in the area of visualising their data and that’s why SAP is also not in the business of visualising our customer’s data (&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/dashboard-design-science-amp-standards-not-random-charts-amp-art-part-one/ba-p/13988893" target="_blank"&gt;even though we can do this is in a great way&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;), but we are in a business of enabling the “Insights to Action” framework which is exactly what I have illustrated in the use case around financial planning powered by agentic AI.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Organizations striving to make data-driven decisions and a proper, also AI powered jump from insights to action, encounter several significant challenges. One major obstacle is seamlessly integrating data across various systems to extract valuable business insights. Additionally, ensuring data quality and integrity is crucial to maintaining trust in the decision-making process. Furthermore, building a comprehensive data foundation is essential for supporting the deployment of AI-based applications. Addressing these challenges requires robust data management strategies and innovative solutions to harness the full potential of data for valuable decision-making.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1017429902"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP's STRATEGY&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;To tackle these challenges, SAP developed the SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC) to provide cloud services that empower organizations in navigating the complexities of data management and business steering process.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP field service management operations set up for any new company settings requires careful planning, which has become much easier with the help of built in cloud AI features. With the help of these smart tools companies in FSM helps with much better decision making. Which also helps the technicians to complete their work more efficiently since they will be getting real-time support, faster &amp;amp; for instance access to the information which they require and smart scheduling. This results in lesser delays, and much improved service quality.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Prerequisites for SAP Cloud FSM: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Must have a valid license for&amp;nbsp;SAP AI Units.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Premium AI features must be activated in FSM tenant.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sufficient Historical Data (1000 activities with the execution Stage should be equal to&amp;nbsp;CLOSE status in order to train the system)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key AI Features in SAP FSM:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Below is the breakdown of the core AI functionalities available&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Intelligent Filtering&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Assignment Duration Prediction&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Activity Summary&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Equipment Summary&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;-&amp;gt; Intelligent Filtering:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Intelligent Filtering will help by showing the&amp;nbsp;most relevant technicians only for the job and automatically sorting. which is like having a smart assistant that understands the input.&amp;nbsp;Instead of checking each customer manually system will sort them based on the requirements of the job, then you will be getting a list of customers who passed the requirements which leads to lesser time consumption and better accuracy.&lt;BR /&gt;For example, imagine you're a dispatcher in FSM who is trying to assign a technician to a service job, you have list of technicians, but not all of them are suitable for all tasks, some might be far away, some might not be having the right skills, and others might already busy with other service jobs assigned previously. so based on the below points we can perform the intelligent filtering.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What the job needs (Like skills, tools, etc.)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Which technicians are available to perform the service task&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Who is nearby&amp;nbsp;to perform the service task&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Who has done the similar job well previously.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Why It’s Useful:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lesser time consumption: No need to manually check the list of all customers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduced errors: Selects only technicians who are qualified and are available.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Improved customer service: Faster and better matches which results in the quicker resolutions for the tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Steps to Enable:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Raise an Incident:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Go to your SAP support portal.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a request under the component:&amp;nbsp;CEC-SRV-FSM-AI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mention that you have a valid license and want to activate&amp;nbsp;Intelligent Filtering.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Will Enable the Feature:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Once the request is processed, SAP will activate the feature in your FSM environment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Verify in the FSM Portal:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigate to the&amp;nbsp;Planning &amp;amp; Dispatching&amp;nbsp;module.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You’ll see technician suggestions ranked intelligently when assigning service calls.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shreya_C_K_0-1755700541606.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303002i213805EAA75881BF/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Shreya_C_K_0-1755700541606.png" alt="Shreya_C_K_0-1755700541606.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Compared to the older&amp;nbsp;Best Matching Technician plugin,&amp;nbsp;Intelligent Filtering&amp;nbsp;is smarter and much easier to use. The old plugin works based on business rules which has been set up for every company, like checking technician skills or distance. whereas Intelligent Filtering in FSM uses the AI&amp;nbsp;to understand what exactly dispatcher is looking for in the technicians and it automatically suggests the best technicians available for the service task.&amp;nbsp; It is much faster, that means it supports&amp;nbsp;natural language searches. And it also gives the extra insights like past equipment history (which is not available in the old plugin doesn’t offer).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Assignment Duration Prediction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Assignment Duration Prediction can be seen during the dispatching of an activity which will provide the overview like how long it will take to complete the current service task, which technician will be suitable for this activity rather than dispatcher guessing how long it might take to complete the current service tasks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;It uses the data like below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The&amp;nbsp;type of service task which needs to be assigned&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The&amp;nbsp;technician’s past performance on the service tasks&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Historical data which are similar to the current service task&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Job priority and some other requirements&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This will help the dispatchers to plan accurately and helps to avoid the delay.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Why It’s Useful:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Better scheduling: can avoid the overloading the technicians.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Lesser delays during the assignment of service tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Steps to Enable:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Training the (AI Model) system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;You can do this in two easy ways:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Option A: Use the Settings Screen&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Go to&amp;nbsp;Settings and Configuration&amp;nbsp;in FSM.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click on&amp;nbsp;Assignment Duration Prediction.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Select your training data and click&amp;nbsp;Train.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shreya_C_K_1-1755700541614.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303001iC813040515B7A137/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Shreya_C_K_1-1755700541614.png" alt="Shreya_C_K_1-1755700541614.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Option B: Use a Sample Business Rule&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Download the sample rule from SAP Help.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Upload it to your FSM system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Add your technical contact and adjust the date range if needed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Run the rule to train the model.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Activate the Feature&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Go to: Settings and Configuration → Planning and Dispatching → General Settings → Activity Planning → Additional Settings&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Turn on the checkbox:&lt;BR /&gt;“Allow assignment duration prediction for semi and fully automated scheduling”&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Start Using It&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use features like&amp;nbsp;Auto-Scheduling&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;Best Matching Technician.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The system will now use&amp;nbsp;predicted durations&amp;nbsp;instead of planned ones when assigning jobs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;

If shipping times are in jeopardy, the warehouse system is then expected to evaluate if an optimized resource allocation could pro-actively solve any potential delays. When a more optimal usage of the available resources is found, resources should automatically be directed to the critical areas. Being able to take action proactively is of the essence, because we do not want to only take action when we are already in delay.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following is an example of an AI-driven, Joule enabled Application that can accomplish the above outlined requirements and activities supported by AI. The Application leverages the embedded AI in the EWM Private Cloud Edition S/4 HANA 2023 FPS03 release and the Joule Studio available in SAP Build.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757445553011.png" style="width: 849px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311902i8C85C1316F32C558/image-dimensions/849x482?v=v2" width="849" height="482" role="button" title="Tim_Dalm_0-1757445553011.png" alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757445553011.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Architecture of the Application looks as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757444996110.png" style="width: 685px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311900i8856978AA3FE5860/image-dimensions/685x445?v=v2" width="685" height="445" role="button" title="Tim_Dalm_0-1757444996110.png" alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757444996110.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-based Warehouse Workload Visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the current version of the Application, the expected workloads of picking and packing operations are calculated leveraging the embedded AI capabilities in SAP EWM, which are then displayed in the UI5 Application (see in the example below):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757511697370.png" style="width: 747px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312397iC01BCF8B5BC170A8/image-dimensions/747x295/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="747" height="295" role="button" title="Tim_Dalm_0-1757511697370.png" alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757511697370.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is also clearly visible in which Activity Area the workload is currently exceeding the planned Resource capacity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Application then further allows a manual simulation of adding or removing Resources to evaluate the impact in a given activity area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The fully "automatic rebalancing" function evaluates whether it is possible to optimize the resource allocation to the different areas, considering the allowed resource types in an Activity Area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If an optimized resource allocation is possible, the warehouse operations manager, can accept these changes and the resources will be reassigned in the EWM system so that they will receive workload to execute from the new area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule-enabled with custom EWM Joule Skills&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further more the current version of the Application provides Joule support for Warehouse Operations Management with the following &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Skills&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Skill 1:&amp;nbsp;Current Workload Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Provide a comprehensive analysis of the current workload associated with picking and packing operations, considering the current resource allocation across different warehouse areas, as well as dependent scheduling of packing activities.&lt;BR /&gt;- &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Skill 2: Provide&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Optimized Resource Allocation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Simulate an optimal workforce allocation strategy to mitigate bottlenecks and criticalities within the warehouse operations, to avoid shipping delays.&lt;BR /&gt;- &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Skill 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accept Optimized Resource Allocation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Accept the optimization results and reassign the resources in EWM to the new areas.&amp;nbsp;

Here are the key reasons why P&amp;amp;A is vital within SAP BDC:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 2: SAP BDC high level architecture &amp;amp; flows in the context of business steering" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317692iE7A343942B6F2956/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="BlazZabukovec_1-1758527062480.jpeg" alt="Picture 2: SAP BDC high level architecture &amp;amp; flows in the context of business steering" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Picture 2: SAP BDC high level architecture &amp;amp; flows in the context of business steering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transformative Insights:&lt;/STRONG&gt; P&amp;amp;A uncovers hidden insights using advanced analytics and planning applications across all lines of business. This capability allows organisations to make informed decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Seamless Integration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; It combines SAP and third-party data to unify diverse data sources, enabling comprehensive analysis and a holistic view of business operations. This integration is crucial for maintaining data consistency and accuracy across the enterprise.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI Augmentation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The integration of business AI, such as SAP’s AI copilot Joule, enhances decision-making by providing augmented insights and predictive capabilities. This helps businesses anticipate future trends and make proactive decisions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced Data Quality:&lt;/STRONG&gt; P&amp;amp;A automatically connects data across the business, ensuring accuracy and accelerating time to insight. This is essential for maintaining high data quality and reliability in business processes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agile Modelling and Predictive Analysis:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Planning &amp;amp; Analytics supports agile data modelling aligned with analytics. It uses AI and machine learning to facilitate predictive analysis and simulation, enabling businesses to adapt quickly to changing conditions and optimise their strategies.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;End-to-End Visibility:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Planning &amp;amp; Analytics offers a 360-degree view of critical business processes with fully-managed, curated data products. This comprehensive visibility and control over operations provide businesses with a clear understanding of their performance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 3: SAP BDC - AI-powered Live-Planning &amp;amp; Analytics in SAP BDC" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317693iCEBDB91779D8513F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="BlazZabukovec_2-1758527062490.jpeg" alt="Picture 3: SAP BDC - AI-powered Live-Planning &amp;amp; Analytics in SAP BDC" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Picture 3: SAP BDC - AI-powered Live-Planning &amp;amp; Analytics in SAP BDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Planning &amp;amp; Analytics is an essential part of SAP BDC, empowering organisations with the tools and insights needed to drive strategic initiatives, improve efficiency, and enhance decision-making across the enterprise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The usage of Planning &amp;amp; Analytics (P&amp;amp;A) is therefore closely connected to the performance of an organisation and creation of business value through several key mechanisms that enhance decision-making, efficiency, and strategic alignment. Here’s how P&amp;amp;A impacts organisational performance:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Real-Time Insights:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The ability to access real-time data and insights allows organisations to respond quickly to market changes and operational challenges. This agility is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and optimising performance, especially in turbulent times like today.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Strategic Alignment:&lt;/STRONG&gt; By aligning financial and operational plans with strategic objectives, P&amp;amp;A ensures that all parts of the organisation are working towards common goals. This alignment is critical for achieving long-term success and improving overall performance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data-Driven Decision Making: &lt;/STRONG&gt;P&amp;amp;A tools provide a single source of truth for data, reducing the need for manual reconciliation and enabling more accurate and timely decision-making. This shift from manual processes to automated data integration enhances efficiency and reduces errors.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improved Forecasting Accuracy:&lt;/STRONG&gt; P&amp;amp;A tools, such as SAP Analytics Cloud, enable organisations to conduct predictive forecasting and scenario planning. This improves the accuracy of financial and operational forecasts, providing a forward-looking view of performance. This allows leaders to react promptly, leading to better resource allocation, strategic planning, and improved performance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced Collaboration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; By integrating planning processes across different departments, such as HR and finance, P&amp;amp;A fosters collaboration and alignment within the organisation. This integration helps create a unified approach to achieving business goals and improves communication across teams.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Increased Efficiency: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Automation of planning processes reduces the time and effort required for data collection and analysis, allowing employees to focus on higher-value tasks such as strategic analysis and decision-making.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In summary, Planning &amp;amp; Analytics enhances organisational performance by improving forecasting accuracy, fostering collaboration, providing real-time insights, enabling data-driven forward looking decision-making, ensuring strategic alignment, and increasing efficiency. These benefits collectively contribute to a more agile, informed, and strategically aligned organisation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Do you want to embark on a journey?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Our company is rolling out GitHub Copilot on a large scale. However, in real-world scenarios, a single coding assistant is rarely enough. Different agents shine in different use cases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, in my own experience, Claude Code is far more powerful than GitHub Copilot when it comes to actual coding. It enables true &lt;EM&gt;Vibe Coding&lt;/EM&gt; in a way Copilot simply can’t.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That said, compliance is always a priority at work. Even if you’ve purchased personal subscriptions, you can’t just use external models freely. This article will walk you through how to leverage company-provided AI models and integrate them into external AI tools.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1631963237"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, you’ll need to request an &lt;STRONG&gt;AI Core client ID and secret&lt;/STRONG&gt;. One way is via the official request process, but you can also subscribe and deploy it yourself on BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H6 id="toc-hId-2080863327"&gt;Apply url:&lt;/H6&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/display/IECOE/GAI02.08+Service+Now+User+Guideline#GAI02.08ServiceNowUserGuideline-HowtoRequestAPIaccessforSAPGenAIPlatform%28Playground%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://wiki.one.int.sap/wiki/display/IECOE/GAI02.08+Service+Now+User+Guideline#GAI02.08ServiceNowUserGuideline-HowtoRequestAPIaccessforSAPGenAIPlatform%28Playground%29&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see Appendix).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once approved, you’ll receive credentials like this:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "AICORE_AUTH_URL": "https://sapit-core-playground-vole.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
  "AICORE_CLIENT_ID": "id",
  "AICORE_CLIENT_SECRET": "secret",
  "AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP": "1768f3f7-6c5b-45de-aeb8-xxxxxxx",
  "AICORE_BASE_URL": "https://api.ai.prod.eu-central-1.aws.ml.hana.ondemand.com/v2"
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our company supports nearly all mainstream models (GPT, Gemini, Sonet, etc.). The challenge is that SAP applies its own unique protocol layer, which makes these endpoints unusable directly with external tools.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To solve this, we need a &lt;STRONG&gt;proxy service&lt;/STRONG&gt; that unwraps the SAP protocol and re-exposes it in OpenAI or Anthropic-compatible formats.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks to Arch (EAS) and Xeric Wei, we already have such a proxy available: &lt;A class="" href="https://github.wdf.sap.corp/I329802/genaiproxy" target="_new" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;genaiproxy&lt;/A&gt;. It currently supports OpenAI and Anthropic. You can use it as is or fork it to extend for other protocols.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H6 id="toc-hId-1884349822"&gt;Setup&lt;/H6&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Python version&lt;/STRONG&gt;: 3.13.6&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Create config.json and key.json under config/ (see samples in repo).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="qjkobe79_0-1758788940458.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/319771i05C9DE578075B265/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="qjkobe79_0-1758788940458.png" alt="qjkobe79_0-1758788940458.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Run proxy_service_v2.py to start the proxy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;By default, it runs at: &lt;A href="http://127.0.0.1:9988" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:9988&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1042422722"&gt;Example: Chatwise&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Configure Chatwise with the following:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Anthropic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Base URL: &lt;A href="http://127.0.0.1:9988/anthropic" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:9988/anthropic&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;API Key: your configured key (e.g. sk-kris)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OpenAI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Base URL: &lt;A href="http://127.0.0.1:9988/openai/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:9988/openai/v1&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;API Key: your configured key&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="qjkobe79_2-1758789065005.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/319774i70F36FEF7F490B59/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="qjkobe79_2-1758789065005.png" alt="qjkobe79_2-1758789065005.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="qjkobe79_1-1758789053101.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/319773i2B39E71D26B34845/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="qjkobe79_1-1758789053101.png" alt="qjkobe79_1-1758789053101.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":warning:"&gt;⚠️&lt;/span&gt;Note: SAP Core AI doesn’t yet support the response API format. GPT-5 still works, but only through a workaround.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also, since SAP truncates model suffixes, you might want to hardcode the model name in your tool configuration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once set up, Chatwise works seamlessly — and the speed is excellent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="qjkobe79_3-1758789141522.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/319775iEAFC444E9D124A08/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="qjkobe79_3-1758789141522.png" alt="qjkobe79_3-1758789141522.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-845909217"&gt;Example: Claude Code&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Claude Code is widely regarded as one of the strongest agents for coding. Unlike GUI-based tools, it’s CLI-native, so it doesn’t require setting up an MCP server. It can do even more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Installation is simple: &lt;A class="" href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview" target="_new" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Claude Code Docs&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To connect it with the proxy, configure your environment variables:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9988/anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-kris&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;That’s it. Enjoy the full power of Claude Code with your company’s AI Core.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="qjkobe79_4-1758789246262.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/319776iD69CD77EF86F27C4/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="qjkobe79_4-1758789246262.png" alt="qjkobe79_4-1758789246262.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Other tools like &lt;STRONG&gt;Cline&lt;/STRONG&gt; work in a similar way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this setup, you can stay compliant, use company-provided AI Core services, and still enjoy the full ecosystem of modern AI coding agents.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Actions are the building blocks that connect your Joule skills to external systems, enabling data retrieval and business operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1566196992"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Access to an SAP BTP tenant with Joule and Joule Studio&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Completion of Part 1: Associate Environment&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Basic understanding of OData services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1369683487"&gt;What You'll Learn&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to create action projects from OData V4 services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to configure input and output parameters&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to test actions before using them in skills&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to publish and release actions for use&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1173169982"&gt;Estimated Time&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;20 minutes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-976656477"&gt;Understanding Actions&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Actions are used in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt; to connect processes with external systems, be it SAP or non-SAP systems, and to make GET, POST, PATCH and other calls. Actions created here can be consumed directly in a Joule skill created in &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;API Focus:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In this tutorial, you will create an action project using the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Sales Order (A2X)&lt;/STRONG&gt; OData V4 API. This API provides create, read, and update capabilities for sales orders using the latest OData V4 specification.

This is where the magic happens - you'll build an intelligent conversational skill that can interact with users and backend systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1566197828"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Access to an SAP BTP tenant with Joule and Joule Studio&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Completion of Part 1: Associate Environment&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Completion of Part 2: Create Action Projects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1369684323"&gt;What You'll Learn&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to create a new Joule skill project&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to configure skill inputs, outputs, and responses&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to integrate actions with your skill&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to deploy and test your skill&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1173170818"&gt;Estimated Time&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;30 minutes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-976657313"&gt;Understanding Joule Studio&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule Studio is SAP's AI-powered development environment for creating conversational AI skills. It provides an intuitive interface for building intelligent applications that can understand natural language and interact with backend systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Focus:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In this module, you'll build a skill that integrates with the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition Sales Order (A2X)&lt;/STRONG&gt; OData V4 API to provide intelligent conversational access to sales order data. Official API reference: &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/CE_SALESORDER_0001/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CE_SALESORDER_0001&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-780143808"&gt;Step 1: Create a Joule Skill Project&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1.&lt;/STRONG&gt;

This demonstrates how to integrate business processes and workflows into your conversational AI skills, enabling end-to-end automation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1566198853"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Access to an SAP BTP tenant with Joule and Joule Studio&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Completion of Part 1: Associate Environment&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Completion of Part 2: Create Action Projects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Completion of Part 3: Create Skills&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Email has been configured for Process Automation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1369685348"&gt;What You'll Learn&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to create an automated process in SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to publish the process to the library&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to use the process in a Joule skill&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How to test the integrated solution&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1173171843"&gt;Estimated Time&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;30 minutes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-976658338"&gt;Understanding Process Integration&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In order for a process to be visible in Joule Studio, the process must have been published to the library - you need to remember to release, deploy, and then publish. You publish from within the Lobby.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this tutorial, you will create a simple automated process for sending an email with sales order information. The process will send email notifications with sales order general and detailed information as the subject and body content.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-780144833"&gt;Step 1: Integrate the Process into a Joule Skill&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1.&lt;/STRONG&gt;
