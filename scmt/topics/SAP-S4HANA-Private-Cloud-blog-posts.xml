    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2025 comes with a whole host of user experience innovations and improvements. &amp;nbsp;Web access via My Home and the SAP Fiori launchpad has many useful improvements, as does SAP Mobile Start for mobile access. Joule gives conversational access to Private Cloud Edition using natural language, now also with analytical insights. There are additional collaboration capabilities, and many improvements in details: some towards providing a more consistent and integrated SAP Business Suite, some simply making a user’s life easier. Finally, design and UI technology is also advancing, with powerful AI support for developers now available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This post covers:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UX Updates for Consistent and Integrated Business Suite&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Web access: My Home and SAP Fiori launchpad&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Mobile access: SAP Mobile Start&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Situation Handling news&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-Assisted capabilities: outlook&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New collaboration capabilities&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UX improvements in details&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UI adaptation improvements for key users&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Design and Technology news&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you want to get an impression of how good SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, looks across all the main product areas, have a look at the online &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana-private-edition/product-tour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Product Tour&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since this post covers what’s new, building on the previous 2023 release, you might want to have a look at the UX innovations which came with the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/8308e6d301d54584a33cd04a9861bc52/4e8cdcc8cbaf4b909217bda9965b7db4.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Feature Pack Stacks&lt;/A&gt; 00, 01 and 02 of the 2023 release:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-update-what-s-new-for-sap-s-4hana-2023-private-cloud/ba-p/13578447" target="_blank"&gt;SAP User Experience Update: What’s New for SAP S/4HANA 2023 (Private Cloud and On-Premise)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/user-experience-advances-with-sap-s-4hana-2023-fps01-private-cloud-and-on/ba-p/13634354" target="_blank"&gt;User Experience Advances with SAP S/4HANA 2023 FPS01 (Private Cloud and On-Premise)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q4-2024-news-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-2023/ba-p/13894277" target="_blank"&gt;SAP User Experience Q4/2024 News for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2023&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For a full overview of what’s new since the FPS00 shipment of the 2023 release, have a look at the documentation (note that it includes features from the above 2023 FPS01 and FPS02 blog posts, as well as this one):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/whats-new/5fc51e30e2744f168642e26e0c1d9be1?Business_Area=ABAP+Platform&amp;amp;q=Fiori+Launchpad&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What’s New for SAP Fiori launchpad for SAP S/4HANA and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1634733921"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UX Updates for Consistent and Integrated Business Suite&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We aim to provide a consistent and integrated experience for all users of the SAP Business Suite, which means providing an entry point for users to access all the various SAP products within the suite, and ensuring that the user experience across these products is consistent, making it easy for users to use applications from different products.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567303135"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Entry Points&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 1 shows our approach for providing a web and a native mobile entry point to the products of the suite, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud. I’d like to highlight that Joule can also be seen as an entry point to access the entire suite, since our goal is to provide Joule wherever you are, be it in our web applications or native mobile apps. Using Joule, our goal is to allow users to query and perform actions on all the products and applications which they are authorized to use, simply using natural language. As you’ll see below, we are making good progress towards this goal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: Entry points providing an integrated workplace for accessing the SAP Business Suite.

Since these capabilities also apply to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition as well as SAP S/4HANA (except for SAP Start), I will not repeat them here, but rather refer you to them:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q1-2025-update-part-1-many-new-innovations-available-ai/ba-p/14012822" target="_blank"&gt;SAP User Experience Q1/2025 Update – Part 1: Many New Innovations Available (AI, Joule and More)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What we will look at in this post in detail are UX innovations for local access from web or mobile, via My Home and the SAP Fiori launchpad, and via SAP Mobile Start. Each has a dedicated section further below.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174276125"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Design Updates for Suite Consistency&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To achieve consistency across the suite, we have made design improvements which are relevant for a consistent user experience across the entire SAP Business Suite, and which are now available with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2025 and SAP S/4HANA 2025. As I mentioned in my April blog post &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/upcoming-design-updates-for-the-sap-business-suite-sap-fiori-for-web/ba-p/14083427" target="_blank"&gt;Upcoming Design Updates for the SAP Business Suite (SAP Fiori for Web)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, consistency of the user experience across the various applications used by a user is an important part of overall usability, helping users to feel confident and at ease when using a suite of products – no unexpected surprises.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this section, we’ll look at four design updates provided by the SAP Fiori launchpad, as well as examples of the new design for illustrations:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigation menu: Side navigation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Updated shell bar&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Updated user menu&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Updated notifications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;New illustrations design&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1106845339"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigation Menu: Side Navigation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many SAP products already offer a navigation menu on the left of the screen, a pattern already familiar to many people. Hence, we have decided to apply that approach to navigation across the SAP Business Suite in upcoming releases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA, the side navigation is displayed as an overlay, as you can see in Figure 2. It gives you direct access to your favorite apps, either directly or via the folders you have created. It also gives you direct access to your Spaces and Pages. The previously available menu to access all your spaces and pages along with personalization options is available via the entry “All Spaces” at the bottom of the menu.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A big benefit of this new navigation menu is that you can now access your favorite apps directly from any application. Previously, you would have to return to My Home and then click on your favorite app, now you can access it directly from the menu, as shown in Figure 2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 2: The new navigation menu, opened up from the new shell bar, showing direct access to Favourite Apps, My Spaces and All Spaces. Alt Text: an image showing a list of sales orders and on the left a pop-over with a navigation menu with the sections already mentioned.

The immediately visible difference is that now the product name is displayed to the right of the SAP Logo, in this case “S/4HANA Cloud” as you can see at the top of Figure 2. The logo and the name are all contained within a clickable area, which brings the user to the start page (e.g. My Home).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The new shell bar enables the next two design updates to the user menu and to notifications&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By default, after upgrading, the old shell bar will be shown, with the new navigation menu. We advise that you check any test automation and RPA (Robotic Process Automation) you may have before switching on the new shell bar, since you may need to make some adjustments – in particular if you log off at the end of a test.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can switch on the new shell bar via the Activate New Features application, with the feature “/UI2/SHELL_BAR_TOGGLE”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-713818329"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Updated User Menu&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new user menu design shown in Figure 3 provides more space for the avatar of the user, and provides more space between items for easier selection. The settings are always at the top as the first entry, and the “Sign Out” option is separated from the actual navigation options in the list, to make it easier to find.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3: Updated design of user menu and notifications.

By default notifications are sorted by date, with grouping by “Today”, “Yesterday”, “Last Week”, “Last Month”. Users can also choose to sort by importance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-320791319"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New Illustrations Design&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have modernized the design of our illustrations, and also made them easier to understand. Figure 4 shows two examples – one for indicating that something went wrong (the fallen ice cream cone), one for search, with an example of where the search illustration is used when opening a list report application without any filter values defined.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 4: Examples of new illustrations.

Often, this requires some key information about the item, for example the name of the product and the value for a purchase requisition. These details are now visualized directly in the task cards, as you can see in Figure 5, making the workflow more efficient.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;To-Dos&lt;/EM&gt; now also shows custom Situations, created using the extended Situation Handling framework, in addition to the standard situations delivered by SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--540494070"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intelligent Homepage Experience&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another useful new feature is AI recommendations for applications: as you can see in Figure 5 in the Apps section of My Home, a new tab &lt;EM&gt;Recommended&lt;/EM&gt; has been introduced which uses AI to create a list of applications which are recommended to the user to add to their Favorites.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To help users get started with My Home, we provide intelligent generation of pre-delivered cards, so that when they first log on, the &lt;EM&gt;Insights Cards&lt;/EM&gt; section is not blank, but rather has a number of pre-delivered cards relevant to the user’s role.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--443604568"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage News Application&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m glad to announce that administrators can now easily create their own news to be displayed on My Home, using the new Manage News application. Figure 6 shows the start page of the application, listing news articles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can specify title, subtitle and main text, a background image, the start and end dates for publishing, as well as categorizing and targeting the news for specific groups of users.

It also controls navigation between apps, as well as settings such as which theme to apply. Here are some additional improvements with the 2025 release.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1130034585"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Automatic high-contrast and dark-mode detection, also for custom themes&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Users can define on their front-end device’s operating system whether applications should appear in a light mode or a dark mode, or a high-contrast mode. Now these settings are taken into account also for custom themes, in addition to SAP visual themes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technically this is done by the launchpad supporting theme sets, which is a group of themes of the same family with different flavors – such as the Horizon theme, with a light and dark version along with high contrast black and high contrast white versions. Customers can create their own theme sets using the UI theme designer. Have a look at the documentation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/a7b390faab1140c087b8926571e942b7/5bc5a24e86a14feea5f2d223d4abf1a4.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=202510.000&amp;amp;q=fiori+launchpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Managing Your Settings&lt;/A&gt; (see the setting &lt;EM&gt;Appearance&lt;/EM&gt;).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1326548090"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hiding empty pages and spaces&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The apps which a user sees on a page on the SAP Fiori launchpad, and the pages which appear in a space, depend on a user’s authorizations. This can lead to a page being defined in such a way that certain users are not authorized to use any of the apps therein; similarly, a space can end up not having any pages available to a user. Now, if this happens, any such empty pages or spaces are hidden from the user, rather than being shown empty.

The editable ones were listed in the tab “Customer-Created”, the others in the tab “Predefined”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our customers gave us feedback that this was in fact confusing, because a page which was listed as “Customer-Created” in a non-productive tenant and which was transferred to a productive tenant became “Predefined” there, i.e. it was not listed under “Customer-Created” despite it being customer-created.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, the design has been changed, with two tabs for editable entities (spaces or pages) and non-editable ones. For example, in the app “Manage Launchpad Pages”, the tabs are called “Pages” and “Page Templates”, as shown in Figure 8. No matter what tenant you are in, you cannot change or edit page templates, you can only use them to create new pages. The same applies to spaces in the Manage Launchpad Spaces app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 8: The redesigned app Manage Launchpad Pages with Tabs for “Pages” and “Page Templates”.

This can be helpful if a specific group of users need different settings, for example if you want to gradually introduce Spaces and Pages, you no longer have to switch it on for all users.

Aren’t Joule Agents a back-end thing? Well… the reason is simple: Joule Agents significantly enhance the overall user &lt;EM&gt;experience&lt;/EM&gt;, as opposed to the user &lt;EM&gt;interface&lt;/EM&gt;, because the system will do a lot more for you based on your requests. This means that the overall experience you have using SAP goes up a level, since you can get a lot done much more easily than before.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule Agents can be triggered from Joule directly or embedded within applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For a general overview of Joule Agents, have a look here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Agents&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; on sap.com.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/ai-agents-in-action/ba-p/14073817" target="_blank"&gt;AI Agents in Action&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; (blog post).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/envision-the-future-of-generative-ai-with-sap-s-ai-agents/ba-p/14029219" target="_blank"&gt;Envision the Future of Generative AI with SAP's AI Agents&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; (blog post).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/how-sap-s-ai-agent-architecture-enables-unprecedented-automation-and/ba-p/14158296" target="_blank"&gt;How SAP’s AI Agent Architecture Enables Unprecedented Automation and Decision Augmentation&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;(blog post by Philipp Herzig).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--38677498"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intelligent Situation Handling news&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/topics/intelligent-situation-handling" target="_blank"&gt;Intelligent Situation Handling&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;speeds up the resolution of critical business situations by automatically and hence proactively alerting users about urgent issues, proposing follow-up actions, letting you monitor situations, and automating the resolution by using business rules.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you’re not familiar with Intelligent Situation Handling, I recommend that you watch the introductory video and read the “Get started” blog posts on the SAP Community topic page:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/intelligent-situation-handling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Intelligent Situation Handling topic page&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the 2025 release, SAP provides nine new situation templates in the areas of finance, public sector, service, sourcing and procurement, and supply chain:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/f5d3e1005efd4e86acf9a65abf428082/0dd53d53b6654cdab30b71d95d966c0f.html?version=2025.000&amp;amp;locale=en-US&amp;amp;parentHref=https://help.sap.com/whats-new/5fc51e30e2744f168642e26e0c1d9be1?locale=en-US%26q=situation&amp;amp;parentName=What%27s+New+Viewer+-+SAP+S/4HANA+and+SAP+S/4HANA+Cloud+Private+Edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;New use cases for Situation Handling&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For the full list of available templates provided by SAP, look here:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/8308e6d301d54584a33cd04a9861bc52/fdbf5eabf0e84621a15c6965b3e01649.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Use Cases for Situation Handling&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--528594010"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New Situation Handling Framework Capabilities&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Already with the 2023 release we made it possible for partners and customers to create their own situation objects with ABAP Development Tooling (ADT) via developer extensibility. This becomes even more powerful with the 2025 release, with the extended framework supporting the collection of data context, support for custom objects in your own use cases, and support for the standard translation option. Let’s have a look at these in a bit more detail.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1018510522"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Data Context supported by the Extended Framework &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The data context is business data from business objects involved in a situation instance that can be collected, distributed, and used for advanced analytics – for example using the &lt;EM&gt;Monitor Situations – Extended&lt;/EM&gt; app. If enabled in a situation type, data context is collected when a situation instance is created, updated, or completed.

You can activate it in the &lt;EM&gt;Manage Situation Types - Extended&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;app. Doing so results in an event being triggered that includes the data context every time a situation instance is created, updated or completed.

This means that more than one user can edit a business object, such as a payment advice, at the same time, and see changes made by others before the object is finally saved. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Within the object page, the object header shows the avatars of those who are editing; you also get the avatar shown next to fields which they are editing. Also, we have extended the grid table to indicate which entries are currently in a draft state, as well as showing those currently being edited by someone else (see Figure 16); this is also available in the responsive tables.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can invite other users to join you in working on an object, as you can also see in Figure 16.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 16: Collaborative draft.

Tasks and Situations which are shown on &lt;EM&gt;My Home&lt;/EM&gt; can now also pushed to users via Microsoft Teams, where they show up as new activities. Figure 17 shows how tasks are integrated.

We continue to work on these details, which can often result in higher satisfaction for users. With the 2025 release, we bring you a large number of improvements, as outlined in the following subsections. Note that we have four interesting ones related to working with tables towards the end of this section.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1772908422"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New Options for Filtering Dates (Semantic Date Range)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have two new features here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We now offer the semantic date range also for selecting dates in the table settings dialog, if you want to define a specific filter on a given field in the table. (Note that the table settings dialog allows you to define filters on all the fields in the table, irrespective of which fields appear in the filter bar at the top of the screen).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I’m pleased to say that, on request of many users, we now provide the option to define filters on date fields for the “Last X days/weeks/months/… to date” as well as the “Next X days/weeks/months/… to date”, where users can specify the number “X”.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;An example of how tricky such seemingly simple things can be: if, on December 11th, you choose “Last 2 months to date”, do you mean the period from November 1st to December 11th, which would be up to the current date but not a full two months, or do you mean “the last two full months”, i.e. October 1st to November 30th? Since both make sense, the selection screen gives users the option to choose, with the default being the “full month” case, described as “exclude current period”, as you can see in Figure 20.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 20: New option for semantic date range.

With the 2508 release we provide information about available keyboard shortcuts directly where you need them, in the context of the application. By selecting “Keyboard Shortcuts” in the user menu, a new window appears explaining all the available shortcuts for the application area currently in focus. If you click on a different part of the application, or navigate somewhere else, then the window showing the available shortcuts is updated immediately for the new context.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 23 shows an example for &lt;EM&gt;Manage Journal Entries&lt;/EM&gt;, where the focus is currently on the filter bar. Clicking on the the table results in many more shortcuts being shown, for example for the arrow keys for moving up and down etc., as shown in Figure 24.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 23: In-context documentation of keyboard shortcuts, for the filter bar.

These changes could be made by other users, or by automated background processing . An example for the latter is the Traceability Results application, which is now automatically updated if a batch run has created new traceability items.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note that this only supported by applications built with SAP Fiori elements using OData V4.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-958524588"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Improved performance for scrolling in grid tables&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our engineers have done some magic so that now scrolling is very fast in grid tables, which are the table type typically used for working with large volumes of data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why do I call it magic? Well, modern web-based UIs have the UI layer running in the browser, managing direct user interactions, and calling services in the backend to get and update data. However, if you are working with a list of say over 100,000 items, you would have to wait quite a long time when starting the application until all items have been loaded into the browser. Hence we only load a certain number to start with, such as 100. This however means that when a user scrolls beyond the 100 which have been loaded, additional data needs to be fetched from the backend, which slows down scrolling. Now, our engineers have found a way to minimize this effect to almost zero, so that you have fast scrolling all the time – magic!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 25: Performance improvement for scrolling in grid tables. Alt Text: a short video showing scrolling through a grid table." style="width: 895px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334672i7C39F7BFC8877273/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="25 Scrolling grid table (Manage Journal Entries).gif" alt="Figure 25: Performance improvement for scrolling in grid tables.

Alt Text: a short video showing scrolling through a grid table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whenever the threshold is reached and more data needs to be loaded, there is a very short delay, with the progress indicator being shown for a few milliseconds, as you can see in Figure 25. In most cases, this is completely negligible. Nevertheless, we do also provide customers the option to change the number of entries loaded by default when the application is started. This is useful if a customer knows that, for a certain application, the number of entries will not exceed 2.000 for example. Then they can set the threshold to 2.000, which means that the application will take a little bit longer to load first time around, but then scrolling will be instantaneous for all the data. Figure 26 shows the UI for doing this, as part of UI adaptation. The “Threshold” determines the maximum number of entries loaded when the application is started, the “Scroll Threshold” determines the maximum number that are loaded during scrolling if new entries need to be fetched.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 26: UI adaptation to determine the threshold determining the maximum number of entries loaded in a table when an application is started.

This information is also stored when saving a view of a table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-565497578"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sort or Group Tables by ID or Description &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Fiori apps display the ID and the description in the same column within a table, which provides a better experience than having them in two separate columns.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, we offer users a choice when sorting or grouping the table by a column which contains both ID and description: they can choose to do this by ID or by description. As you can see in Figure 27, this selection is very intuitive. The example shows what it looks like when sorting by Company Code. At the bottom of the table you see an entry “1710 (BestRun US)”, where the Company Code (the ID) is 1710 and the Company Name (the Description) is “BestRun US”. In the popover “Sort By” section, the row of icons next to Company Code and Company Name indicate that currently no sorting is active, with the option to sort either bei Code or by Name ascending or descending.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 27: Sort or group tables by ID (in this case Company Code) or by Description (Company Name) when both are displayed together in one column .

Until now, when users personalize the table, both the ID and the description were listed in the list of columns, which confused some users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, we have addressed this by providing the option to hide the descriptions (see Figure 28), and hence simplifying personalization. This option is on by default, i.e. the description fields are automatically hidden now.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 28: Description fields can be hidden from the list of fields shown when personalizing tables.

For the full list of what’s new since the FPS00 shipment of the 2023 release, have a look at the What’s New Viewer:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/whats-new/5fc51e30e2744f168642e26e0c1d9be1?Business_Area=ABAP+Platform&amp;amp;q=Fiori+Launchpad&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What’s New for SAP Fiori launchpad for SAP S/4HANA and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-465873575"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UI adaptation improvements for key users&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We have made significant enhancements to UI Adaptation for key users with the 2025 release. The “Adapt UI” option which key users see in their user menu shows you what you can change in the app, in a very intuitive way. And you can change and adapt far more than in the past. See below for some highlights.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Also good to know: the Adapt UI menu entry is also available when using a Classic app (SAP GUI for HTML) from within the SAP Fiori launchpad. It will bring up the Adapt UI app for Screen Personas&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F5740')/S35" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;F5740 Adapt UI for Classic Applications with Screen Personas&lt;/A&gt;, which allows key users to adapt the layout of these classic UIs. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--24042937"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Users Can Rearrange ID and Description Within a Field or Column&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP applications come with a standard arrangement of ID and description within a field or a column, based on user research. We have found that for financial users, it is usually best to have the ID first and the description in brackets: Company Code (Company Description), for example “1710 (BestRun US)” as shown in Figure 27. For users in sales and logistics, it is usually best to have the name first and the ID in brackets: for example Customer Name (Customer ID), for example “US Specialty Cycles 5 (USCU_S05)” as shown in Figure 2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, key users can use UI adaptation to rearrange the order for a given application. Doing this change applies then to all occurrences of the field in the application, i.e. the filter bar, the table or in a form on an object page.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--513959449"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Far More Options for Key Users to Adapt UIs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key users can now make far more significant changes to UIs than before. For example, they can add a button to clear all filter values in the filter bar, remove buttons such as the “Export to Excel”, and much more. Figure 29 shows the options for configuring a table for example.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 29: Many more options for Key Users to adapt UIs.

The great advantage of using building blocks is that you can use them to create a customer layout and yet still benefit from the advantages of the metadata driven approach: low code, built in enterprise-grade capabilities such as multi-language support, accessibility, security and performance, and design system consistency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find out more in this six-part series of blog posts, here is the first one, which contains links to the others:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-the-sap-fiori-development-portal-your-gateway-to-rapid-sap/ba-p/14236768" target="_blank"&gt;Introducing the SAP Fiori Development Portal: Your Gateway to Rapid SAP Fiori App Creation (1 of 6)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--838426771"&gt;Using AI to Develop UIs&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The above posts from &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q1-2025-update-part-7-ui-design-and-technology-for-web/ba-p/14034290" target="_self"&gt;Q1/2025&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-7-ui-design-and-technology-for-web-and-mobile/ba-p/14197128" target="_self"&gt;Q3/2025&lt;/A&gt; introduced a number of powerful ways to accelerate UI development by using AI, such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creating SAP Fiori elements apps from a sketch (in the Q1 post), now integrated in SAP Build Code and Joule (Q3 post)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule for SAPUI5 freestyle development (Q1 post)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted auto-fix of coding errors with UI5 linter (Q3 post)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recently, we have gone even further and introduced MCP servers for freestyle SAPUI5 development as well as for developing with SAP Fiori elements and the associated building blocks. These&lt;SPAN&gt; open-source&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;servers provide AI agents with comprehensive UI5 and SAP Fiori elements knowledge, including best practices and project-aware context information, and thus provide developers with valuable support.

Adopting the latest standards gives applications a true cutting edge, ensuring that solutions are inclusive and meet the diverse needs of users globally.&amp;nbsp;When creating apps with SAP Build and SAPUI5, developers can leverage the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, two of the key new requirements in the 2.2 version are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The minimum target size of an interactive element now needs to be 24x24 px, so that users don’t accidentally activate a neighbouring element.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Each operation that can be performed by dragging can also be performed alternatively without dragging – so that people who cannot use a mouse to drag can still use the UI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;See more details:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sapui5-is-leading-the-way-in-accessibility-with-wcag-2-2/ba-p/14101596" target="_blank"&gt;SAPUI5 is Leading the Way in Accessibility with WCAG 2.2&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1231453781"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Blue Crystal and Belize Themes No Longer Available in the Web&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As announced in April (&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/upcoming-removal-of-sap-fiori-themes-belize-and-blue-crystal/ba-p/14063111" target="_blank"&gt;Upcoming Removal of SAP Fiori Themes Belize and Blue Crystal&lt;/A&gt;), the visual themes Blue Crystal and Belize have been removed from our web UI technology with the 2025 release of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;After upgrading, existing usages of Belize or Blue Crystal will be automatically redirected to the Horizon theme&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;If you have created your own custom theme based on Belize or Blue Crystal using the UI theme designer, you will need to migrate this to an available theme.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Our strong recommendation is to base the new version on the Horizon theme.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information about the web UI technologies affected, and how to migrate custom themes, have a look at this blog post:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/announcement-removal-of-belize-theme-of-sap-fiori/ba-p/14061924" target="_blank"&gt;Announcement: Removal of Belize theme of SAP Fiori&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note that SAP GUI for Windows continues to support older themes, including Blue Crystal and Belize.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1134564279"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Final words&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Come join us at &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/germany/events/teched.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;TechEd 2025&lt;/A&gt;, November 4 - 6, either virtually or in Berlin, or at one of the TechEd On The Road events in Louisville (USA), Bangalore (India) and Sydney (Australia), to find out more about our latest user experience innovations.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Disclaimer: this article is written without Generative AI, even for the proof reading &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy the article written by human that is not common nowadays&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763843457"&gt;Why Business AI?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is what we always must start with. The business case should go first, for sure, and then we should evaluate possible deployment options, costs and security.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Statistics says that 95% of Generative AI implementations failed and that really scares the market in SAP enterprise software domain as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But let’s be honest, we are trying to sell Business AI anywhere as technology, forgetting about the customers, their uniqueness and their current pain points.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At Skybuffer starting from February 2025 (during the last 9 months) we have talked to more than 250 customers of different sizes presenting them Business AI technologies and discussing their use cases, or better to say helping them to find how Business AI can help their employees and partners to automate company’s workflows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are three main groups of use cases, as we see it now:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Direct interaction with SAP backend system via corporate messengers that brings simplicity and mobility at the same time. In many cases Creating or Updating data in SAP from mobile phones or via Teams brings real value.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Converting any unstructured data to knowledge, like SharePoint sources, attachments in SAP, support tickets. Mixing those things together, in different document original languages create real value for employees providing them access to the data that is hidden in most of the organizations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Capacity heavy activities delivered by AI agents, especially helpful with emails data analysis, where the main data is always in attachments. Sometimes it requires to utilize OCR extracting data from scanned PDFs in those scenarios. Some excellent examples are processing vendors emails and posting invoice or service entry sheets into SAP or receiving emails from customers converting their external purchasing data to sales orders.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is why SAP customers with any SAP backend system, either SAP ECC or S/4HANA, can implement Business AI today. I am not saying that it covers the entire Business AI implementation benefits, however, that is what we are focusing on now and helping SAP customers to allocate the benefits of using the technology.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567329952"&gt;Costs&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our opinion, Business AI is the tool that must be deployed inside IT infrastructure, and it is not a technology that must be considered only if it returns the investment. Think about the indirect impact of missing Business AI in your business landscape. For example, consider the costs of hiring new staff because your employees are moving to other companies that utilize modern technologies. Why should they move? Obvious, because of the same reason we are all talking about Generative AI – to stay competitive on the market.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, costs of AI must be assessed carefully, because in most of the architecture approaches Business AI is a consumption-based solution. Risky, isn’t it? Of course! Consumption is hard to estimate, and it is also hard to avoid picks, so budgets of Business AI productive usage might be unacceptably high compared to the potential savings the technology brings. That is why we built Skybuffer AI as a solution with the double deployment options:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On premise, there is a clear and 100% predictable TCO.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On SAP BTP, this is a great option for CPEA contracts, for example, because in this case Business AI consumes the credits that are already paid, and we avoid extra costs for the infrastructure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1370816447"&gt;Why is DGX Spark in the article name?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Well, DGX Spark here is not because it is a buzz word now, for sure. That is because DGX Spark provides an excellent opportunity for small and medium enterprises to bring 15x15x12 cm GPU-unit to support their Business AI operations for a very compatible price. Actually, it allows us to keep both compute-unit and GPU-unit in the network avoiding data leakage and consumption-based costs. Excellent? Of course!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is how we use it deploying Skybuffer AI on premise:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_01_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338340i394A99D0F206E036/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_01_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" alt="Pic_01_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 01. Skybuffer AI deployment with GPU-unit served by DGX Spark&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174302942"&gt;Criticism?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, even writing this article I am already hearing the criticism &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt; Guessing the comments like, “that is not for productive environment”, “DGX Spark tokens generation too low to serve even Small businesses” and many other sharp negatives. But let’s move back to the beginning of the article and understand the reason why I’ve spent so much time talking about use cases first. Yes, now it is obvious that many mentioned use cases can be addressed by DGX Spark working as GPU-unit. Example? Easy!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example #1:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Vendor emails processing with data posting into SAP backend and saving originals (files) into the DMS (like SharePoint, Join, Google or whatever DMS is in use).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the architecture mentioned above, Skybuffer AI allows almost out of the box creation of an AI Agent that will check, for example, Account Payable mailbox, read emails, analyze attachments, move them to DMS and create financial postings in SAP backend saving links to the attachments in DMS (either external or internal SAP DMS) on the SAP financial document level. In scenario, if we schedule the agent carefully, it can work in the almost synchronous 24/7 mode.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In case we schedule the Vendor Emails processing AI Agent with the limit to process just one vendor email in the minute, we will avoid pick system loads, and in this case, we can keep AI agent active 24/7. In such deployment it will be able to process 1 440 emails and create postings in SAP a day, that gives us 43 200 a month and amazing number of 518 400 documents a year!! All powered by one DGX Spark GPU-unit keeping the data on premise and avoiding cloud consumption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is what we call a proper deployment of Business AI. And Small and Medium businesses do not usually have such big number of documents from vendors, even the Cirque du Soleil does not have according to the latest SAP news post &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt; What we usually do, we add extra Business AI scenarios to be processed by the same Skybuffer AI deployment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example #2:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Automation of SAP user management services&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Small and Medium businesses do use password-based login to SAP backend, so users keep locking themselves or forgetting their passwords. Do we need a powerful GPU-unit with the full size LLM to automate this? No, for sure. We can add those business scenarios to the AI Agent that is processing Vendor Emails &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example #3:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Bank data reconciliation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The same setup can be used to assist financial department to match bank transactions to the billing documents in SAP and post accruals for the cases that could not be reconciled, for example, those that miss billing data in SAP that is not created just because someone has forgotten to enter it or integration interfaces have data processing issues. DGX Spark GPU-unit provides particularly good enough capacity here as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Those are just a few examples that wind away the skepticism about the utilization of DGX Spark in productive environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-977789437"&gt;Is it safe to invest in the on-premise Business AI setup?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you need full control over costs and data security, the answer is yes. And we think that the answer is yes in general, because Skybuffer AI dual deployment capabilities gives companies the guarantee that on premise Business AI investment can follow their potential future cloud strategy. I am writing and hearing again “what is this crazy man talking about! On premise investment can follow cloud strategies?? That is a paradox!”. And again, the answer is No, of course there is no paradox! If we look at the deployment of Skybuffer AI with integration with SAP Joule:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_02_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338341i7F20323CDD2557C3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_02_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" alt="Pic_02_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 02: Skybuffer AI deployment in SAP BTP with integration with SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is what we call real flexibility!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781275932"&gt;Sounds like a Gap Closing Solution?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, that is the conclusion we have. There no hard choice anymore to run Business AI on premise or on SAP BTP, no prerequisites to start using Business AI, because the deployment in this article works with SAP ECC (down to 7.01 and even below), SAP S/4HANA on premise or SAP S/4HANA in private cloud. The only question must be asked, when we are talking about Business AI, is about the scenario the company should start with? You’ve seen in our examples that Business AI deployments might bring benefits working in the scenarios that are independent from the historical data you have in your SAP backend and the historical data quality (sometimes it is called data silos), or scenarios that are independent from the version of your system and the point in time of your current digital journey. No need to wait for the upgrades, migrations, or other activities that sound like an act of catching a tail &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt;. Just allocate some budget for Business AI deployment, for example, on-premise deployment on DGX Spark that is very affordable, and get the positive feedback from your employees or business partners and enjoy your business workflows simplifications.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1634736770"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The previous two episodes have demonstrated how to create and register a custom mass processing function code in COHV as well as have provided an outline of the actual implementation of the mass processing. However, the implementation has not done anything useful, yet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, it is the time to add some meat to the implementation and dive into more advanced topics like test mode, function parametrization and order updates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1438223265"&gt;Test mode&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let us start with test mode. Typically, SAP standard mass processing functions provide a test mode option that runs all data processing without actually saving any changes or updates. That is particularly useful if you want to test a mass processing run without committing the updates.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1 Test mode on" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334752i6C2E18FFE74EA10B/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Dominik_Tylczynski_0-1761917035115.png" alt="Figure 1 Test mode on" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 1 Test mode on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 2 Test mode off" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334753iDEEAF86769372C91/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Dominik_Tylczynski_1-1761917078022.png" alt="Figure 2 Test mode off" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 2 Test mode off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The implementation of the mass processing function does not need to explicitly handle test mode operation, i.e. either to rollback or commit changes. That is done by COHV backbone. Make sure to test thoroughly if the test mode is used to make sure that the custom mass processing function is compatible with the test mode handling in COHV.

That is often used in SAP standard functions, and it can be enabled for custom ones.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, additional parameters need to be added to the transparent table and the dialog structure that have been created in the episode 2. Make sure to add the same fields of the same type to the table and to the structure.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3 The transparent table with a parameter" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334754iE818ADE1FEA02C30/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Dominik_Tylczynski_2-1761917108547.png" alt="Figure 3 The transparent table with a parameter" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 3 The transparent table with a parameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 4 The dialog structure with a parameter" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334755i7E67BFDB564FA38D/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Dominik_Tylczynski_3-1761917152630.png" alt="Figure 4 The dialog structure with a parameter" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 4 The dialog structure with a parameter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once that is done, the parameter will appear in COHV.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 6 The function's parameter in COHV" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334756i1CE66484BB1F341F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Dominik_Tylczynski_4-1761917186216.png" alt="Figure 6 The function's parameter in COHV" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 6 The function's parameter in COHV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1045196255"&gt;Mass processing logic implementation&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, let’s implement the mass processing logic to update production orders.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In advanced Available-to-Promise (aATP), customers have different options to optimize the availability of articles or products. Supply protection (SUP) is one of these methods, which is integrated into other processes in aATP.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Sometimes it’s not clear how supply protection works with other methods and how to differentiate to other methods. The methods have a lot in common, like the usage of a characteristics catalog. But there are also differences regarding the use cases, the usage in a process, and there are pros and cons for every method.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s look at different aspects of the integration of supply protection into the following processes in aATP:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Product Availability Check (PAC)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Product Allocation (PAL)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Backorder Processing (BOP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Alternative-Based Confirmation (ABC)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supply Assignment (aRUN)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2022038625"&gt;Link:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Help: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/f132c385e0234fe68ae9ff35b2da178c/e541e617043545a0bb60e5067d037046.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Integration into other Processes&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567359682"&gt;Supply Protection and Product Availability Check (PAC)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Planned supply protection is relevant for the product availability check (PAC), which determines whether a demand (for example, from a sales order) can be confirmed. The product availability check compares the request of the sales order with the available stock for the related material. Within this logic, there is also a check if there is supply protection available for the relevant combination of material and planning level. If yes, the system calculates the restricted quantities and reduces the available stock for the sales document. If this reduced quantity is not sufficient to meet the request, the sales document will not be (fully) confirmed for the requested delivery date. Supply protection also reduces the available stock after the replenishment lead time (RLT). However, the availability check is calculated with infinity stock. The restrictions defined by supply protection don’t have an impact after the RLT.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whether supply protection is considered in the product availability check depends on the settings for the scope of the availability check. Only if supply protection is activated in the scope of check for the related checking rule, will PAC consider supply protection. For more information, see  &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/32da8359c8ee4e8b8e8c5e15cacba5aa/ba0f6c4463d545cd8500ea8cb0787b54.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=2508.500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;How to Activate Supply Protection&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As supply protection is integrated in the basic method of the product availability check, the impact of supply protection when creating a sales document is also shown in the Review Availability Check Result app, as part of the intermediate results of the check. For more information, see  &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/32da8359c8ee4e8b8e8c5e15cacba5aa/e24f9f08ee5a4022a3086226edab15d9.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=2508.500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Supply Protection in Review Availability Check Result&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;The following illustration shows how &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;s&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;upply &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;p&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;rotection reduces the availability by adding virtual demands:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Supply Protection within the Product Availability Check" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335413i73FB70AEA884BC57/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sup_pac.png" alt="Supply Protection within the Product Availability Check" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Supply Protection within the Product Availability Check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1370846177"&gt;Supply Protection and Product Allocation (PAL)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Several use cases can be addressed with product allocation or with supply protection; and sometimes they can even be used in combination. Logically, the product allocation check is performed before the availability is checked. Therefore, PAL can limit the request which is checked in PAC (together with SUP).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1303415391"&gt;What are the differences between Product Allocation and Supply Protection?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the sales product allocation check, it is possible to define an upper limit for a group. A matching demand can’t get a higher confirmation compared to the limit defined in product allocation. As the sales PAL is checked in advance of the product availability check, the allocation ignores the availability situation. A demand which is limited by PAC can’t get more quantity, even if there is no shortage. In case of a shortage situation, a demand within the defined allocation can get the quantities if the stock is available, and if the PAL limit isn’t exceeded. This leads to the issue that another requested quantity can’t get confirmation although there is a matching PAL quantity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Supply Protection and Product Allocation" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335423iB3838ABADEA221E7/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SUP_PAL.png" alt="Supply Protection and Product Allocation" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Supply Protection and Product Allocation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Supply protection is integrated in the product availability check and considers the availability situation. It adds virtual demands so that the availability is reduced, depending on whether the demand matches a supply protection object or not. If there is a lot of supply compared to the protected quantities, supply protection doesn’t have an impact on sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1106901886"&gt;Can Supply Protection and Product Allocation be Used as Complementary Methods?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, with supply protection, minimum quantities can be defined. With this, it can be ensured that even in shortage situations important groups can get some quantities. With product allocation, limits can be defined, which prevent a group from taking too much quantity and not leaving enough for others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, there is a risk of a wrong setup, where product allocation prevents the consumption of quantities protected by supply protection, and vice versa. This is the case when, for example, supply protection with high priority exists for a key customer, and there’s also a product allocation object matching the demands of this key customer. If the product allocation is already consumed, this customer can’t order more quantity. In this case, consumption of protected quantities in supply protection isn’t possible, and other demands are restricted by this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advantages of Supply Protection&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Allows different settings of restrictions, but will not limit demands, if there is enough stock/supply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advantages of Product Allocation&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Can be set up also on more generic levels (not only a specific material-plant combination), which requires less maintenance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1039471100"&gt;Link:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Help: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/f132c385e0234fe68ae9ff35b2da178c/e9861099432c4fd9a569f129f2d4ceb1.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Best Practices for Supply Protection – Using Supply Protection and Product Allocation&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-584792157"&gt;Supply Protection and Backorder Processing (BOP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With backorder processing, it is possible to recheck orders with specific rules so that orders which have been confirmed may lose their confirmation while others can now get confirmed. With BOP, it’s possible to reallocate available stock to competing sales orders, allowing customers to prioritize some orders ("winners") over others ("losers").&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This seems to be close to the idea of supply protection. However, the logic of BOP is to reopen sales documents and change the sequence. A winner is processed first and has a rule to get a better result. A loser will come later and has a rule that the result can be worse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-646444090"&gt;Links:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Help: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/f132c385e0234fe68ae9ff35b2da178c/73a1a457ef816b10e10000000a441470.html?version=2025.000" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Backorder Processing (CA-ATP-BOP)&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-320847866"&gt;How does Supply Protection work together with BOP?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;While processing backorders, supply protection is checked as well. The consumption of protected quantities in supply protection will get removed temporarily, and the orders which are processed first are also checked against supply protection. The result will be different, but it considers the restrictions of supply protection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Naturally, it wouldn’t make sense to set up protection groups with high priority for demands which should be “losers”, according to the defined logic for BOP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--4748358"&gt;Supply Protection and Alternative Base Confirmation (ABC)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With ABC, it is possible to define alternative options for supply by exchanging a product and/or a plant. Depending on the rules for ABC, a demand for product A could be replaced by product B, which is not the same but treated as a good substitute.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the perspective of supply protection, this is always a new, independent check. The reason is quite simple: product and plant are keys for supply protection. If a product is exchanged by another product, the check for supply protection will search for matches and calculate restrictions for a different material-plant-combination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this case, there won’t be a consumption for the originally matching supply protection object. For the second check, consumption might be written.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--440813520"&gt;Link:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Help: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/f132c385e0234fe68ae9ff35b2da178c/61ce286def63461487ee039b7c375070.html?version=2025.000" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Alternative Base Confirmation (CA-ATP-ABC)&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--50521011"&gt;Supply Protection and Supply Assignment (ARun)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Supply assignment ensures that the supply is assigned to the orders according to the changing requirements. Supply protection is only a virtual demand and doesn’t have a direct relationship to supply elements. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Quantities which are assigned via supply assignment are not considered as available quantities in PAC.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763751164"&gt;What Is a Purchasing Profile?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;A Purchasing Profile is a structured container of organizational, accounting, and process data assigned to purchasing personas (purchaser, requestor, contracting officer). It centralizes shared attributes so users do not repeatedly search, re-enter, or manually maintain foundational data. It also isolates role-relevant information, reducing noise in day-to-day tasks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567237659"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Without profiles, every purchasing action (request, order, contract) requires manual selection of entities like company code, cost center, purchasing org. data, or accounting information. Profiles let the system derive these automatically, letting users focus on true differentiators (item, supplier choice, terms).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1370724154"&gt;Key Personas&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Purchaser: Executes ordering.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Requestor: Initiates demand; minimal commercial adjustment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Contracting Officer: Manages contractual frameworks and compliance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;A business configurator (or administrator) sets up profiles centrally instead of each persona maintaining their own settings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174210649"&gt;How Profiles Work&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each profile bundles attributes (organizational units, accounting defaults, category controls, workflow indicators). These are referenced when creating purchasing objects (purchase requisitions, orders, contracts).

This reduces duplication:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Define common data once (e.g., legal entity, currency).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Specialize at lower levels (e.g., category restrictions).&lt;BR /&gt;Attributes can be:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Excluded: explicitly removed so they do not propagate further.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Overridden: replaced with a new value.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Marked as default: preferred value when multiple candidates exist.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-584670134"&gt;Exclusions and Defaults&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Exclusion flags stop an attribute from flowing down the inheritance chain. Default flags resolve ambiguity when more than one candidate attribute could apply.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-388156629"&gt;Flexible Hierarchy&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;No rigid tree structure is imposed. You can design a model aligned to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Geography&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Business unit&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Spend category&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Project or program&lt;BR /&gt;This flexibility supports gradual evolution without full redesign.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-191643124"&gt;Implementation Tips&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Inventory common purchasing data elements.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Start with a base (global) profile.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Add layers only where differentiation is justified.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use exclusions sparingly; prefer consolidation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Audit default flags to avoid silent conflicts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Document profile intent for each layer.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--4870381"&gt;Summary&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Purchasing Profiles streamline creation of purchasing documents by centralizing and inheriting key data across personas. They reduce maintenance effort, improve consistency, and allow flexible structuring without enforcing a rigid hierarchy. Proper setup enables purchasing users to concentrate on value-added decisions rather than repetitive data handling.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;When using the staging approach for your data migration, you often face the challenge that the provided XML file contains sheets and columns within the sheets that are not relevant for your business needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763872374"&gt;Did you know that it is possible to adjust the XML files easily?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, before I go to the possible options, note that you must be careful when deleting, as any change can corrupt the XML structure. There is also no guarantee that such a tailored XML file can still be used after upgrading to a higher release.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After creating a migration project in the SAP S/4HANA migration cockpit using the &lt;STRONG&gt;Migrate Your Data&lt;/STRONG&gt; app select &lt;EM&gt;Download Template&lt;/EM&gt; in Action for a specific migration object and choose &lt;EM&gt;File&lt;/EM&gt; Type&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ XML file&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1825524307"&gt;Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The description below is for Microsoft Excel. The procedure may differ when using another spreadsheet program than Microsoft Excel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1499928083"&gt;Option 1: Delete a non-mandatory sheet&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Open the downloaded file and choose &lt;STRONG&gt;Enable Editing &lt;/STRONG&gt;button&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Select a non-mandatory sheet you want to delete – choose the context menu by clicking on your mouse and choose "&lt;STRONG&gt;Delete".&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Löschen1.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335420i1AA9F52864917EF9/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Löschen1.png" alt="Löschen1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Confirm on the follow up pop-up you want to delete.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Löschen2.png" style="width: 476px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335399iA21778CAA32204ED/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Löschen2.png" alt="Löschen2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Proceed in this way with all the non-mandatory sheets that you want to delete.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1561580016"&gt;Note&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can only delete non-mandatory sheets and delete sheets even though the worksheet contains mandatory columns. This is because there is no need to fill the mandatory columns in the sheet with data if the sheet itself is not relevant for your project.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1106901073"&gt;Option 2: &amp;nbsp;Delete a &lt;STRONG&gt;non-mandatory &lt;/STRONG&gt;column within a sheet&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, you need to unprotect the sheet. So, you need to select a sheet where you want to delete one column or more columns – choose the context menu by clicking right on your mouse and select “&lt;STRONG&gt;Unprotect Sheet&lt;/STRONG&gt;”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Löschen3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335400i15A365303A493D96/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Löschen3.png" alt="Löschen3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select the column(s) you want to delete – in my example all columns for &lt;EM&gt;Tax Calculation Brazil&lt;/EM&gt;. Choose "&lt;STRONG&gt;Delete"&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1039470287"&gt;Note&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alternatively, you can go to File → Info → Protect Workbook area and click on &lt;EM&gt;Unprotect&lt;/EM&gt; for the sheets you want to make changes on.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Löschen4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335401i396EF98BF5327F3A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Löschen4.png" alt="Löschen4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Save your changes. You can now fill your XML file as usual and load the data into the SAP S/4HANA migration cockpit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you upload your data, the tool informs you that the &lt;EM&gt;Validation Completed with Warnings. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Löschen5.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335404i7FC776E4DEFFD618/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Löschen5.png" alt="Löschen5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To be able to view the messages, choose "&lt;STRONG&gt;Show Messages"&lt;/STRONG&gt; you get a list of all messages occurred during &lt;EM&gt;Validation&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this case, warnings are displayed because the fields deleted in the previous steps are missing from the sheet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Löschen6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335406iB49B6E0B7BE9770C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Löschen6.png" alt="Löschen6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;To load the data into the SAP S/4HANA migration cockpit select your file and transfer the data via &lt;EM&gt;Actions →&amp;nbsp;Transfer Data to Staging Tables&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Löschen7.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335409i76371A87D0AEA91A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Löschen7.png" alt="Löschen7.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;The instances will be loaded into the SAP S/4HANA migration cockpit staging tables.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Löschen8.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335410iD1435D1BEBB13200/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Löschen8.png" alt="Löschen8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can now proceed with your data migration steps as usual.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-713874063"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Using CSV files&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Like the XML file, you can easily tailor your CSV files &amp;nbsp;as you only need to use the files for the structures and fields you want to process. Just provide the files for mandatory structures and the structures you need. Within the files you must also only provide the mandatory fields and the fields you need. All the other fields you can remove.&amp;nbsp; A CSV file has much less administrative data than an XML file. The 100 MB limit is the same, but with tailored CSV files the http-protocol related size limit is not reached that fast as using XML files.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial black,avant garde" color="#000080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori is the primary user experience of SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So if you are already using SAP Fiori in the classic SAP Business Suite, the degree of change in SAP Fiori for SAP S/4HANA can come as a surprise. The uplift in SAP Fiori can add an extra unexpected challenge to your system conversion.&amp;nbsp; In this post you will learn which decisions are needed and gain some suggestions on how to resolve them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hint: The &lt;STRONG&gt;classic SAP Business Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt; includes &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP ECC, SAP Suite on HANA, SAP Simple Finance, SAP SRM, SAP GRC, and other solutions running on SAP NetWeaver. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These suggestions are collated from experiences of myself and my colleagues in the Early Adopter Care program for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, and our SAP Customer Services &amp;amp; Delivery colleagues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From our experiences across system conversion customers worldwide who are already using SAP Fiori in classic SAP Business Suite. These customers usually:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Have deployed a limited number of SAP Fiori apps&lt;/STRONG&gt; - usually less than 100 apps - in their classic SAP Business Suite environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;May be using SAP Fiori in a hybrid mode.&lt;/STRONG&gt; For example, using SAP Fiori for employee self-service and manager self-service apps, and some targeted mobile apps, while SAP GUI is used for daily on-system tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Want to take bring quick wins (aka immediate ROI) from the new/improved SAP Fiori&lt;/STRONG&gt; launchpad features, and from the huge amount of predefined launchpad content available in SAP S/4HANA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Even where the strategy is to move all users to the &lt;STRONG&gt;central launchpad&lt;/STRONG&gt; – i.e. SAP Fiori launchpad in SAP Build Work Zone – you still need your &lt;STRONG&gt;local launchpad&lt;/STRONG&gt; – i.e. SAP Fiori launchpad available on-stack in SAP S/4HANA – deployed as well.&amp;nbsp; The local launchpad is the target for content federation, and gives you access on-stack configuration, administration apps, and clean core extension apps. &amp;nbsp;Refer to &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-minimum-ux-you-need-for-sap-business-ai-and-clean/ba-p/14243103" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Fiori for SAP S/4HANA – Minimum UX you need for SAP Business AI and Clean Core&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;First the good news: &lt;STRONG&gt;Your change management journey is easier.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even though the SAP Fiori launchpad has changed, your users will recognize:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;the overall look and feel of the launchpad,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;some of the main launchpad features such as Settings, Search, and Notifications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;know generally how to work with tiles, links and apps.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Your target user experience: the SAP Fiori launchpad My Home page as it appears in SAP S/4HANA 2025." style="width: 816px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336306iADCF69B57C02870B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="My Home for S4H Cloud Private 2025 (2 column tasks).png" alt="Your target user experience: the SAP Fiori launchpad My Home page as it appears in SAP S/4HANA 2025." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Your target user experience: the SAP Fiori launchpad My Home page as it appears in SAP S/4HANA 2025.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now for the work ahead!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Start by listing all your existing SAP Fiori apps, custom-built apps, partner-built apps, and any custom-built launchpad features.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/STRONG&gt;A simple spreadsheet will do.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hint: Do your best to capture the SAP Fiori app id for apps delivered by SAP. &amp;nbsp;You can use the app id to find successor apps. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When doing a system conversion to SAP S/4HANA:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You will need to decide which of your existing apps and launchpad features to &lt;STRONG&gt;retain, replace, or discard&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You may need to &lt;STRONG&gt;adjust custom-built apps and custom-built launchpad features&lt;/STRONG&gt;, such as launchpad plug-ins.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This includes&lt;STRONG&gt; partner-built apps and launchpad features&lt;/STRONG&gt; that you are using.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post you will learn:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Replace your predefined SAP Fiori apps with successors&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retain your custom-built Fiori apps&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Verify partner-built Fiori apps you have deployed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review your launchpad feature usage for successors&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Remember your administrators&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Watchpoints when coming from SAP Fiori in Enterprise Portal&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reintroducing your upgraded launchpad to your business users&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Learnings to get you started&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Background information: What’s behind the changes in SAP Fiori&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1635450830"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;Replace your predefined SAP Fiori apps with successors&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Expect that most of the predefined SAP Fiori apps you are using in SAP Business Suite (SAP ECC) will need to be replaced. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Of the 836 SAP Fiori apps provided for the classic SAP Business Suite, only 248 of these are supported in SAP S/4HANA 2025.&lt;/STRONG&gt; That’s less than 30%. Of those 248 apps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;3 apps are deprecated and should not be used&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;20 apps are available with successor, so you should use the successor&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;11 are reuse apps that provide sub-features and are not available as tiles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;27 are industry-specific (mostly IS-OIL and IS-HER) and not relevant to most customers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;69 are relevant only to SAP GRC&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;12 are relevant to SAP HCM compatibility pack – and are replaced by successors when moving to SAP HCM for SAP S/4HANA&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Leaving only 106 apps generally available, or about 12% of apps. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hint: You can test this for yourself in the SAP Fiori apps reference library, downloading your list of apps and running them through the &lt;STRONG&gt;Upgrade Impact Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt; against your target SAP S/4HANA release. Refer to &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-upgrade-impact-analysis/ba-p/13553449" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Fiori for SAP S/4HANA – Upgrade Impact Analysis&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;At most customers, the only app that is retained is SAP Fiori app &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F0862')/S31PCE" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;F0862 My Inbox&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hint: If you are currently using app &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F0862')/S31PCE" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;F0862 My Inbox&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt;, you should consider with your system conversion:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Adding &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori app &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F6511')/S31PCE" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;F6511 My Outbox&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt; to all users who have My Inbox.&amp;nbsp; My Outbox is a predefined app in SAP S/4HANA that reuses the same configuration as My Inbox. My Outbox provides self-service answers such as: Where is that workflow now? Who is the next approver? Is that workflow complete? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;You may also want to consider adding the unified inbox across cloud solutions - &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Task Center&lt;/STRONG&gt; - which can be deployed with SAP Build Work Zone on desktop, and with SAP Mobile Start on mobile devices. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Most other apps will need to be replaced by successors.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1568020044"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;General advice about successor apps&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sometimes there are obvious successors. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Successor apps can look and behave very differently to your current app. You will need to deploy the successor app to explore it.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Successor apps often have improved clean core compliant extension options. You will need to learn clean core techniques, such as Custom Fields, Custom Logic, and Adapt UI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you have extended your existing SAP Fiori app, you will need to review your extensions, decide if the extensions are still needed, and if needed, reapply them using clean core compliant techniques.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sometimes there are no successors. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, where the functionality has been moved to a SAP Cloud solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Where there are no successors, you will need to consider your options, such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Deploy the successor SAP Cloud solution&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Replace with a custom-built app&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Revert to a classic UI – such as SAP GUI, Web Dynpro application, or WebClient UI&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hint: If the classic UI works but is simply too busy for your users, or missing some defaults / tips, you can make some easy improvements with SAP Screen Personas. SAP Screen Personas is the &lt;STRONG&gt;Adapt UI for classic GUI transactions&lt;/STRONG&gt;. There is no additional subscription needed for SAP Screen Personas. SAP Screen Personas flavors can be easily applied to existing launchpad content using the Launchpad App Manager – Adaptation Mode to add the parameter for the Personas Flavor. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Refer to:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Help – &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SCREEN_PERSONAS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Screen Personas&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SCREEN_PERSONAS/1024f4ede569495cb350a479fff49ad0?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=Current" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How to use SAP Screen Personas with SAP Fiori Launchpad&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Fiori app&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F5740')/S35" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt; F5740 Adapt UI for Classic Applications with Screen Personas&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Example of Adapt UI for SAP GUI transactions in the SAP Fiori launchpad as it appears in SAP S/4HANA 2025 FPS0 :&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Adapt UI for GUI Transactions in SAP S/4HANA 2025 launches SAP Screen Personas flavor maintenance for the app" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336305i751D4205C3370B46/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Jocelyn_Dart_0-1762315615796.png" alt="Adapt UI for GUI Transactions in SAP S/4HANA 2025 launches SAP Screen Personas flavor maintenance for the app" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Adapt UI for GUI Transactions in SAP S/4HANA 2025 launches SAP Screen Personas flavor maintenance for the app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371506539"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;How to find Successor Apps&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;These are predictable patterns you can use:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review Related Apps in the SAP Fiori apps reference library&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Approve apps become My Inbox sub apps&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;HCM apps move to SAP SuccessFactors and/or SAP HCM for SAP S/4HANA&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SRM apps move to Ariba or to Procurement&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Smart Business apps move from HANA Live to ABAP CDS Views&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Predictive Model apps move to Intelligent Scenario Lifecycle Management (ISLM)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Factsheet apps move to SAP Fiori elements Object Page&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1304075753"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Review Related Apps in the SAP Fiori apps reference library&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Check the Related Apps tab.

Most custom-built apps based on SAP Fiori design and development models will convert relatively easily as classic SAP Fiori programming models are still supported in SAP S/4HANA. This includes custom-built sub-apps for tasks in SAP Fiori &lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F0862')/S31PCE" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;F0862 My Inbox&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Important:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt; Supported means that the apps will technically still work. However, these classic techniques have several disadvantages compared to the latest techniques to support Enterprise-ready apps.&amp;nbsp; Refer to UI5 Demo Kit documentation - &amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/bf2d55eaa33b44a78ef95e7946d658e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Enterprise Features of SAPUI5&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Classic programming techniques usually require more effort to upgrade, are NOT considered Clean Core, and are NOT recommended for building new apps! &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Refer to SAP Note &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3578329/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3578329 -&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frameworks&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Technologies and Development Patterns in Context of&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clean&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Core&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You will need to review your custom-built apps for:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Frontend (SAPUI5) coding&lt;/STRONG&gt; – you will need to check for any adjustments needed due to the change in SAPUI5 version.&amp;nbsp; You should refer to the advice in UI5 Demo Kit – Read Me First – &lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/9638e4fce1bd45f4bebf7c219672908c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Upgrading&lt;/A&gt; .&amp;nbsp; You should consider verifying your apps using the SAPUI5 legacy-free version as explained in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/explore-sapui5-openui5-1-136-x-legacy-free/ba-p/14103271" target="_blank"&gt;Explore SAPUI5/OpenUI5 1.136.x-legacy-free&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Backend coding&lt;/STRONG&gt; – You will need to check if any database tables you update still exist, and if the OData V2 services you are using require any changes. These coding changes are typically covered by your custom code migration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hint: In your SAP S/4HANA solution you can activate the on-stack Custom Code Migration apps to make cleaning your apps easier during/after system conversion:&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F3191')/S31PCE" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;F3191 Custom Code Migration&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;You need to &lt;STRONG&gt;prepare your business users for mandatory changes&lt;/STRONG&gt; in your custom-built apps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On system conversion, &lt;STRONG&gt;custom-built apps using the SAP Fiori elements floorplans are automatically upgraded&lt;/STRONG&gt; to the latest version of the floorplan.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Usually this is a positive change as it makes it easier for your business users to adopt new apps in SAP S/4HANA – especially Manage apps, Monitor apps, and Overview page app, and they get automatic benefits such as personsalization, Export, and Share features included with their apps.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you decide to replace a custom-built or partner-built app that is currently coded as a SAPUI5 freestyle app, you should:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Update your programming practices to SAP Best Practices.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Consider moving custom-built apps to SAP Fiori elements for faster development and greater consistency for business users&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review the advanced extension options with the &lt;STRONG&gt;Flexible Programming Model Explorer &lt;/STRONG&gt;– these help you avoid creating a freestyle app … keeping your overall solution consistent&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Consider applying &lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/a8e55aa2f8bc4127923b20685a6d1621" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAPUI5 Flexibility Services&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; – to minimize future changes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Explore the new SAPU5 legacy-free version to check the app against best practices&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are intending to use SAP Build Work Zone, you may also want to consider whether you deploy your custom-built apps to the ABAP Platform of SAP S/4HANA, or to SAP BTP. &amp;nbsp;If your app uses any SAP BTP services, or integrates with non-SAP data or components, you should consider deploying to SAP BTP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-243542358"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;Verify your partner-built apps and features&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is critical that you check with your partner whether your existing partner-built app or launchpad feature (e.g. launchpad plug-in) will also work for SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;Important:&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;Do this early&lt;/FONT&gt; as it may impact your commercial arrangements with your partner.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If the apps and features are part of partner product you can refer to SAP Note &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3634480/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3634480 - SAP&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Cloud Private Edition&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;: Compatible&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Partner&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Products&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hint: For on-premise customers refer to SAP Note &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3654390/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3654390 - SAP&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;, on-premise edition&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Compatible&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;partner&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;products&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Where your partners were employed software developers who have custom-built apps for you, you may need them to review the front-end and back-end coding of their apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The same guidelines apply as for your self-developed custom-built apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-47028853"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;Review your launchpad feature usage for successors&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many apps – including custom-built apps – rely on launchpad features to work.

That is an intent consists of a logical Semantic Object + Action pair, that can flexibly be used to point to any UI content supported by the SAP Fiori launchpad.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, there have been several major shifts in launchpad content and layout maintenance. Refer to: &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-upgrade-faster-major-shifts-in-sap-fiori/ba-p/13853649" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Fiori for SAP S/4HANA – Upgrade Faster – Major shifts in SAP Fiori implementation&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Target Mappings and Tiles are no longer separate entities. They are combined into Launchpad App Descriptor Items (LADIs).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A LADI combines a target mapping with one or more related tiles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;LADIs avoids the risk of misalignment when assigning tiles and target mappings.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can choose which tile to display when maintaining your page&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hint: If you have separated your catalogs for tiles versus your catalogs for target mappings, use the technical catalog migration tool in your system conversion to correct your design. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Catalogs follow a 2-level design that is supported and enforced by the tooling. That is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cross-client technical catalogs that hold original LADIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Client-specific business catalogs the reference LADIs from the technical catalogs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Business catalogs are assigned to (composite or single, SAP or custom) business roles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technical catalogs can hold many LADIs. They are essentially a container of LADIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business catalogs typically reference a limited number of LADIs, that are assigned to a business role together, such as the smallest Segregation of Duties combination.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Hint: If you have a single-level catalog design, use your system conversion to correct your design. If you have assigned business roles to technical catalogs, use your system conversion to correct your design. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can use the migration tool for technical catalogs to move your tiles/target mappings to LADIs and align your catalog design to the required 2-level design.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Refer to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-technical-catalog-migration-why-and-getting-ready/ba-p/13630918" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Fiori for SAP S/4HANA - Technical Catalog Migration – Why and Getting Ready for Migration&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-technical-catalog-migration-how-the-migration/ba-p/13636667" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Fiori for SAP S/4HANA - Technical Catalog Migration – How the migration process works&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hint: The technical catalog migration has been further improved in SAP S/4HANA 2025 to make this easier.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Launchpad Designer is deprecated. You will move to new tooling for managing launchpad content, including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Launchpad App Manager&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Launchpad Content Manager Client-Specific&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Launchpad Content Aggregator - read-only view of launchpad content&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Launchpad Spaces&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Launchpad Pages&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Overview of Roles, Spaces, and Pages – read-only view of launchpad layouts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Launchpad Configuration Parameters&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Role-based Launchpad Configuration Parameters via transaction /UI2/FLP_PROF_CONF (new with SAP S/4HANA 2025)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;All these tools support both single and composite business roles. You will find these tools are assigned to the Fiori Foundation Administration role generated as part of rapid activation task list &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP_FIORI_FOUNDATION_S4&lt;/STRONG&gt; task Generate Fiori Foundation roles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1749922506"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000080"&gt;Watchpoints when coming from SAP Fiori in SAP Enterprise Portal&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are coming from SAP Fiori deployed in SAP Enterprise Portal, there are some additional watchpoints.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Select your SAP Build Work Zone edition.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You should compare features available for the central launchpad on SAP Build Work Zone standard edition versus advanced edition. If your aim is to create a full business site then advanced edition may suit your needs better.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. The Universal Work List moves to SAP Fiori app &lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F0862')/S31PCE" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;F0862 My Inbox&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most tasks (work items) will be automatically transitioned.&amp;nbsp; However, you may want to improve the visualization. If you have configured your Universal Worklist with dynamic columns you will need to explore the extension options in F0862 My Inbox.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Pay attention to navigation via OBN&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;OBN (Object-Based Naivgation) is specific to the SAP Enterprise Portal. Based on customer experiences, you may have some issues getting existing OBN to work in the SAP Fiori launchpad. SAP Fiori launchpad uses intent-based navigation. There are several workarounds already available. For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Note &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3254771/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3254771 - Failed to resolve object based navigation target in&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fiori&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Launchpad&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3475684/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3475684 -&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;OBN&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Navigation Failure within Side Panel App using SAP&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;FIORI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;System Entry&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2934443/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2934443 - Object Based Navigation in standalone scenario fails&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1378659/E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1378659 - NWBC known issues &amp;amp; what to check when opening a ticket&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Use of LPD_CUST for creating a report hierarchy is still supported. However, you must NOT use LPD_CUST for launchpad content navigation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To integrate launchpad content with the SAP Fiori launchpad, you must reconfigure your content using the Launchpad App Manager.

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1634791457"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Why clean data is the foundation of enterprise &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;success&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’ve all been there: reports that don’t align, systems that refuse to speak the same language, and data that seems to have a mind of its own. It’s frustrating, time-consuming, and costly. Unclean data doesn’t just cause confusion - it multiplies complexity. It clogs business processes, drives up the number of upgrade cycles, and makes every transformation effort harder than it needs to be. And these aren’t just data quality issues - they’re symptoms of a fragmented data foundation that slows progress and limits innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now imagine a world where every decision is powered by data that just&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;works&lt;/EM&gt;: accurate, consistent, governed, and seamlessly connected across the enterprise. That’s what clean data makes possible. It’s the quiet engine behind transformation -the unseen force that fuels &lt;STRONG&gt;trust&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;agility&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;innovation&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clean data turns chaos into clarity. It enables governed, reusable data products built on shared semantics and harmonized master and reference data - so information flows freely across domains, analytics deliver truth instead of noise, and AI scales with confidence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Building on this foundation, the clean core approach takes the next step - transforming data clarity into business agility.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;It helps organizations unlock the full power of intelligent, connected operations by relying on harmonized, semantically linked data. When processes are standardized around proven best practices and strategic extensions are enabled for differentiation, businesses gain the agility to evolve without complexity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;With SAP Business Suite at the center, this approach keeps systems current, fuels continuous innovation, and paves the way for faster adoption of AI - turning trusted data into a true engine of transformation.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="mariaberg_0-1762185855995.png" style="width: 824px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335507iF680870141982415/image-dimensions/824x439/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="824" height="439" role="button" title="mariaberg_0-1762185855995.png" alt="mariaberg_0-1762185855995.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567360671"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The business power of clean data &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clean data is more than a technical concern - it’s a true business enabler.

Within the&amp;nbsp;clean data framework, the answer begins with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;RISE with SAP Methodology&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It provides a clear roadmap, guiding organizations from identifying data challenges to building, monitoring, and scaling a sustainable clean data strategy. Through&amp;nbsp;automated clean data KPIs, organizations can track the state of their data in real time - across both projects and day-to-day operations. All of this comes together in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;RISE with SAP Methodology Dashboard&lt;/STRONG&gt;, offering a unified view of data health, performance, and progress toward true data-driven agility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="mariaberg_2-1762185855995.png" style="width: 808px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335508i30188FD3A0D1C31C/image-dimensions/808x426/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="808" height="426" role="button" title="mariaberg_2-1762185855995.png" alt="mariaberg_2-1762185855995.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781306651"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ready to take the first step?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clean data is not a one-time project - it’s a journey and a discipline.

    <title>Should you wait until FPS1 is available before implementing or upgrading to SAP S/4HANA 2025?</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="285381_GettyImages-163640390.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336466iA0072BB2CFEA8750/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="285381_GettyImages-163640390.jpg" alt="285381_GettyImages-163640390.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hello, and thanks for spending some time reading this blog post! As a member of the SAP S/4HANA RIG (Regional Implementation Group), we share our collective insights and knowledge with the broader SAP community through blog posts and SAP Learning courses. We’ve published over 700 blogs and delivered numerous courses to help you navigate the world of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, I want to address a commonly asked question we have received since the release of SAP S/4HANA 2025: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Should customers wait until FPS1 is available before implementing or upgrading to SAP S/4HANA 2025?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s clear the air: Customers who want to take advantage of a new S/4HANA release immediately can and should install FPS00. Remember, SAP S/4HANA was first launched in 2015. Therefore, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA is a mature solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Additionally, in the latest releases, SAP has emphasized refinement and enhancements over introducing radical changes, which, in the past, could have been the root cause of errors when implementing the initial stack.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Moreover, &lt;STRONG&gt;our commitment to quality is robust.&lt;/STRONG&gt; In addition to rigorous testing by our development team, we actively involve customers and partners in the &lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/influence-adopt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Beta program&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; with every release. This initiative enables the real-world testing of new features and the evaluation of transition paths, such as new implementations and upgrades. Throughout the program, we received no reports that would jeopardize product stability. In fact, survey results from participants supported the release of SAP S/4HANA 2025 based on their testing experiences.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I'd like to share some good news about &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori – the primary user experience of SAP S/4HANA &lt;/STRONG&gt;- and SAPUI5 - the User Interface (UI) framework of SAP Fiori. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the past, when SAP released a new version of SAP S/4HANA, the initial release (FPS0) was introduced with a SAPUI5 innovation version, which was not intended to be a long-term version. For this reason, customers often preferred to wait for the SAPUI5 long-term maintenance version, released with a later update (FPS01), before going live with SAP S/4HANA in their production environment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Starting with SAP S/4HANA 2025, SAPUI5 is released on the long-term maintenance version right from the initial release (FPS0).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; This means you can confidently use the user experience in production from day one, minimizing disruptions and ensuring easier support. For more information, refer to the following SAP Notes: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2217489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2217489 - Maintenance and Update Strategy for SAP Fiori Front-End Server&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3636986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3636986 - SAPUI5 maintenance strategy for SAP_UI&lt;/A&gt; and the accompanying SAP blog post &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-fiori-deployment-options-and-sap-fiori-front-end-server-strategy-update/ba-p/13444527" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Fiori deployment options and SAP Fiori front-end server strategy - UPDATE 2025&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As usual, it’s recommended that you start with the latest available patch level of your SAPUI5 version. For SAP S/4HANA 2025, the SAPUI5 version is SAPUI5 1.136.&amp;nbsp; Your technical team can refer to our new learning video &lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/videos/patching-sap-fiori-sapui5-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Patching SAP Fiori (SAPUI5)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; to learn how to apply patches quickly and easily. &amp;nbsp;You can find the latest available patch level at the &lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/versionoverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAPUI5 Versions Maintenance Status&lt;/A&gt; page.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAPUI5.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336467iAADDA01DA0F1368B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SAPUI5.png" alt="SAPUI5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Of course, there are valid reasons why some customers may want to wait for a future FPS. Here are two scenarios that might justify pausing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Add-Ons Compatibility:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;If you rely on&amp;nbsp;Partner add-ons (Solution extensions) or&amp;nbsp;third-party add-ons that are not currently compatible with SAP S/4HANA 2025,&amp;nbsp;it’s&amp;nbsp;crucial to engage with the add-on vendors to understand when&amp;nbsp;they will be compatible.&amp;nbsp;It may take a few months, so it could be wise to wait for FPS1 before&amp;nbsp;proceeding.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Future Innovations:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Each FPS comes packed with new innovations. If there’s a specific feature planned for FPS1 that can add significant value to your business, it might make sense to wait until that functionality is available. To find planned features, you can check the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73555000100800004663&amp;amp;FT=PR_CLOUD_ONLY&amp;amp;range=CURRENT-LAST#Q4%202025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Road Map Explorer&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In conclusion, while there might be reasons to consider waiting, the overall landscape for SAP S/4HANA 2025 is looking promising. If you decide to forge ahead, you can do so with confidence in the maturity and robustness of the solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are considering moving to SAP S/4HANA 2025 and would like SAP support with product-related issues and product-related questions, you can apply to our SAP S/4HANA Customer Care program, following the instructions described here: &lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/campaign/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Cloud Private Edition - Customer Care&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you for reading, and I encourage everyone to embrace the latest innovations that come with SAP S/4HANA!. If you find this blog useful, please consider giving it a "like" or sharing it. I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback, so feel free to leave a comment.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;For years, the MIME repository has been the standard location for storing SAPUI5 runtime artifacts for SAP S/4HANA and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. In contrast, the S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition retrieves SAPUI5 from the cloud CDN. Although the MIME repository has served its purpose, many customers working with SAPUI5, especially system operators installing new SAPUI5 patches, face common challenges. These include poor performance, numerous manual steps, issues with transports, and risk of inconsistent states.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The good news is that SAP introduces the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAPUI5 Runtime Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt; with the release of &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This modern replacement overcomes these challenges and prepares you for the next generation of SAPUI5. To ensure efficiency for all customers, downports to all maintained lower releases are available, except for SAP S/4HANA 1809 using SAPUI5 1.38. You can access this repository through SAP Notes containing &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/9d6aa238582042678952ab3b4aa5cc71/81a0376ed9b64194b8ecff6f02f32652.html?locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;transport-based correction instructions&lt;/A&gt; (TCIs).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let's explore how this new repository significantly enhances your workflow.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763872225"&gt;Performance Where It Matters&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIME Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: SAPUI5 patch updates can take up to 2 hours. Loading debug-sources with sap-ui-debug=true can take up to 10 minutes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAPUI5 Runtime Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Patch upgrades are approximately 20 times faster. During runtime, loading debug sources also occurs about 20 times faster. These improvements ensure smoother operations and faster response times.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567358720"&gt;From Complexity to Simplicity&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIME Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Handles more than 70,000 individual ABAP objects. This volume poses a risk of errors and inconsistent updates.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAPUI5 Runtime Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: All runtime content is bundled into just one ABAP object. This approach guarantees consistent updates and reduces operational risks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1370845215"&gt;Automation First&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIME Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Updates rely on custom, manual procedures, which increases the maintenance effort.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAPUI5 Runtime Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Uses SAP TCI Notes and comes with an automated process specifically for SAP S/4HANA cloud operations. This makes updates easier and more reliable.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174331710"&gt;Zero Downtime Deployments&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIME Repository:&lt;/STRONG&gt; No support for zero-downtime deployments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;This limitation might cause interruptions during system upgrades. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAPUI5 Runtime Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Fully supports online deployment with zero downtime.&amp;nbsp;This feature ensures that SAPUI5 content remains continuously available, even during system upgrades.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-977818205"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Safe, Standardized Rollbacks&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIME Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Reverting patches can be error-prone, often requiring manual fixes and risking inconsistent system states.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAPUI5 Runtime Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Reverting SAPUI5 patches is fully supported. Runtime content is delivered as a single ABAP object, and the update process integrates with TCIs. Rollbacks are straightforward, consistent, and safe. This approach simplifies the validation of new patches&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: if issues arise, you can reliably revert to the previous stable state without lengthy manual intervention or risking inconsistencies across systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781304700"&gt;Future-Proof&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIME Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Not compatible with multiple SAPUI5 versions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAPUI5 Runtime Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Supports multiple SAPUI5 versions in parallel, making it ready for the future while ensuring backward compatibility.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here's an overview of all the improvements:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="srr.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336982i3BA99AB0B7644090/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="srr.png" alt="srr.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-584791195"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The move from MIME Repository to the new SAPUI5 Runtime Repository isn’t just a technical upgrade — it’s a significant step toward:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Faster and safer patch updates.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduced operational effort.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Continuous availability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Future compatibility.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If your organization uses on-premise landscapes and works with SAPUI5, it's time to embrace this change: the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAPUI5 Runtime Repository&lt;/STRONG&gt; becomes automatically available with the current &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt; release and in the latest support packages of all maintained SAP S/4HANA versions except SAP S/4HANA 1809.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even if you do not want to upgrade to a new support package, you can still use the SAPUI5 runtime repository by installing SAP Note &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3599156" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3599156&lt;/A&gt;. If you have hesitated to install a new SAPUI5 patch, now is the time to try the new procedure and benefit from its efficacy and ease. Installing the latest SAPUI5 patches ensures your applications run efficiently today and are prepared for the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;Have you performed any SAPUI5 patch upgrades recently? What has your experience been like so far?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;ASUG Tech Connect 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky, delivered big on both technology and connection. From the opening keynote to the final session, there were many examples of how AI improves both developer and business user productivity. While all the generative AI technologies are revolutionary and potentially very disruptive to organizations that ignore their impact, it was great to see AI applied in a variety of ways from creating ABAP code to moving Z-transactions in a clean core methodology. In this post, I’ll highlight a few important themes, along with several moments at ASUG Tech Connect that made an impact on me. In each section, I’ll provide some questions for you to discuss with your team.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="PeterSpielvogel_0-1762801138690.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338280i24E800082A04B44B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PeterSpielvogel_0-1762801138690.png" alt="PeterSpielvogel_0-1762801138690.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1764651626"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP is still going strong&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The session “Extensibility with ABAP Cloud and AI in SAP Cloud ERP” says it all. Jens and Raghavendra &amp;nbsp;showed that ABAP has new generative AI tools that you can use to extend standard SAP Fiori apps and build new custom apps. With so many customers still contemplating their journey to SAP S/4HANA Cloud, the ability to use familiar skills makes it easier to transition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1568138121"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-powered features make SAP Cloud ERP even easier to use&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In “What’s Next: AI-First Innovations in SAP Cloud ERP and SAP Business Suite”, Ullas and I showed several new embedded features to boost business users’ productivity, most of which were powered by AI. Demos included a mix of released functionality, features in beta, and even a sneak preview of something from our lab. We received lots of great feedback on how people plan to use smart helpers if we bring this to market.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="321"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;My Home for SAP S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="321"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori elements apps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="321"&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted enterprise search&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted smart personalization of My Home for insights cards&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted smart solutions for situations in My Home&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Recap&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="321"&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted easy filter&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted smart summarization&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted easy fill&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted error explanation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Smart Helpers (working name – sneak preview)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ask yourself: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Do your business users still spend too much time on manual navigation? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Could a smart home screen or conversational interface drastically reduce that?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What is holding you back from adopting AI in your organization?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371624616"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No-code, low-code, and pro-code are converging with vibe coding&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In “Using Generative AI to Accelerate SAP Fiori App Development” Ullas demonstrated how code-generation, conversational interfaces, and tooling changes are altering how we build apps. Using VS Code and Cline, connected to an SAP back end, he created a fully functional app, including CAP service and sample data, using only text prompts – no coding at all. He started the app creation process by loading an image of what he wanted, then added functionality by asking Cline to build it. When error messages came up, he pasted screen shots back into the tool and asked it to fix the error. This can reduce the time to create a first prototype from weeks to hours. Skilled developers are required for making sure the app is production worthy, testing, and putting into production. We had some customers share their experience using coding agents and appreciation for how SAP packaged this to simplify the process. Some plan to expand their efforts on this journey and potentially share their stories in next year’s ASUG Tech Connect or SAP TechEd.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ask yourself: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How much more AI can you use to accelerate development? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What would you need to see to gain confidence that you can use it for building apps? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Can you rebuild some of your old customizations in a clean core way to make your IT environment more agile?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175111111"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori is essential to capture the full value of your SAP Cloud ERP implementation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;My session on “Creating better user experiences with AI-powered SAP Fiori apps” discussed how SAP Fiori is a critical part of generating value from using SAP S/4HANA. Most of the audience had some Fiori experience and most were using AI in some capacity in their organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="PeterSpielvogel_1-1762801138697.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338279i68D8CFB620D86ACB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PeterSpielvogel_1-1762801138697.png" alt="PeterSpielvogel_1-1762801138697.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The session started with the origins of Fiori and highlighted the huge leap in usability from the old SAP GUI screens to the intuitive, agile, and intelligent UX that My Home and SAP Fiori apps provide. It included a demo of many of the UX innovations in SAP Cloud ERP today, and discussion of how to get started with Fiori in your organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/HD7Cgbq?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1255407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;View slides from “Creating better user experiences with AI-powered SAP Fiori apps” session&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The main message was to get started now on your UX transformation to provide your employees with a better user experience and access to AI-assisted capabilities that are built int SAP S/4HANA Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ask yourself: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What is holding us back from using more Fiori in the organization? Is it resistance from the users themselves, IT, or the business owners?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How do we quantify the business value of SAP Fiori in terms of higher user productivity, better data quality, lower training costs, and reduced cost of making changes to screens?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-978597606"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clean core is necessary for digital transformation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The topic of clean core, meaning minimizing customizations to the SAP S/4HANA environment, was reinforced everywhere. The hands-on sessions “Build On-Stack Extensions with ABAP Cloud in SAP Cloud ERP” and “Modernize Classic Extensions for Clean Core” emphasized how you can use clean core principles and still build customizations to fit your business’s unique needs. Andre, Nora, and Ullas explained how to do this and guided people through practical exercises.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ask yourself: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How much customization do you need to run your business? (Less is more!)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Can you use standard apps for more processes than you are doing today? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What is the cost of maintaining your custom code and how much is custom code preventing you from adopting the latest SAP ERP versions?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-782084101"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;You don’t have to move to SAP Cloud ERP on your own&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With such a broad collection of industries represented at ASUG Tech Connect, it was easy to find someone who had already solved the challenges you are facing. That’s the whole point of attending a large networking event like this – to connect with like-minded individuals who want to move forward and need a little help (or push). I was fortunate to have many interesting breakfast, lunch, and break conversations about where people are struggling with moving their users to SAP Fiori apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The colleagues from Naturipe Farms, Brian and Dario, shared some of their experiences in “Customer Show and Tell: From CDS View to Fiori Launchpad: Full-Stack Development with Eclipse ADT with Naturipe.” It was the third year in a row that they are presenting, so it’s great to follow their progress. Next year they plan to share their progress with a vibe-coding approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="PeterSpielvogel_2-1762801138700.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338278iB233F0B421102780/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PeterSpielvogel_2-1762801138700.jpeg" alt="PeterSpielvogel_2-1762801138700.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ask yourself: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What communities can you join to learn from peers? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.asug.com/membership" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;ASUG&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt;, &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://tinyurl.com/elementsroundtable" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Fiori development roundtable&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;EM&gt;?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What thought leaders do you follow on LinkedIn that you can learn from?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-585570596"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There is no technology change without people change&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s always the “soft skills” sessions that surprise me at SAP events with the lasting impact they make. Perhaps this is because the fundamental principles don’t change from year to year with new technology innovations, so they generally have more staying power. The panel on “Leading change in the age of AI: driving digital transformation through emotionally intelligent communication” had many great insights for business and technology leaders who are steering their organizations through the massive changes that an SAP S/4HANA upgrade, SAP Fiori implementation, or AI adoption brings. Some key takeaways included: focusing on business outcomes and ensuring that people can grow from the changes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ask yourself: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How can I empower my people by asking them: What are you good at? What do you want? What do you need? What do you fear? This will help you preempt many objections that are rooted in these issues.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What happens to my organization if we do nothing?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-389057091"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Get comfortable being uncomfortable&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a time of rapid change for enterprise software and business in general. The AI tools have frequent updates in which their capabilities improve in some areas and don’t in others. It’s hard to keep up with all this, but critical. Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang says “You’re not going to lose your job to AI. You’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI.” Change is a part of progress; get used to it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Ask yourself: &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What new AI-related skills have you learned in the next month? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Where can you try some AI in your business that will allow you to learn with low risk?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Next steps:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review the slides, which are available to attendees on the &lt;A href="https://events.asug.com/event/e7bd56fe-4c89-4e90-bc2c-ff75b4cc099b/asug-tech-connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;ASUG Tech Connect website&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Start exploring &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-fiori-tools-update-first-release-of-the-sap-fiori-mcp-server-for/ba-p/14204694" target="_blank"&gt;AI tools for development&lt;/A&gt; now. Even if you are not ready to incorporate them into your core business processes, you need to gain experience using them if you want to stay relevant in the industry.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Identify two use cases where AI can make a measurable business impact. Build a proof of concept in your test environment or sandbox system to measure the return on investment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Follow the speakers of sessions that you liked on LinkedIn. You will gain insights into what they are working on and likely see innovations as soon as they become available.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/nl/sap-fiori-development-newsletter/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Subscribe to our SAP Fiori development newsletter&lt;/A&gt;, where we will share new innovations for application development as soon as they are available.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In today’s fast-paced ERP transformation landscape, achieving process transparency, harmonization, and efficiency is critical. Organizations migrating to SAP S/4HANA face the challenge of aligning complex business processes across multiple units while ensuring adoption of standardized templates. SAP Signavio’s Process Landscape Analysis (PLA), as part of the &lt;A href="https://www.signavio.com/highlights/plug-and-gain-approach/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;plug and gain approach&lt;/A&gt;, addresses these challenges by providing a structured, data-driven way to manage and optimize processes throughout the transformation journey.&amp;nbsp;All essentials and key resources regarding plug and gain approach can be found &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/plug-and-gain-essentials-and-key-resources/ba-p/13949095" target="_self"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The latest update of the PLA introduces new content, an improved user experience and a completely new dashboard, making process harmonization easier and more actionable than ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, you will get a high-level overview of:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The latest updates to&amp;nbsp;Process Landscape Analysis&amp;nbsp;and its new structure&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The new&amp;nbsp;Adherence to Target Processes&amp;nbsp;dashboard and its key insights&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1635599623"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1439086118"&gt;The Process Landscape Analysis&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371655332"&gt;First: what's new in the update?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The latest major PLA update delivers &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/signavio-process-transformation-suite/getting-started-guide-plug-and-gain-approach/scope-of-business-content" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more and deeper content&lt;/A&gt; and new capabilities to track harmonization and ensure process adherence. The image below gives a clear overview of the current version and everything that will be added new.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338836iC6AFC30C1CCF042C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture1.png" alt="Picture1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175141827"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-978628322"&gt;Understanding the Process Landscape Analysis&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;What does this mean? To give a bit more context, let’s dive a bit more into the process landscape analysis and how it is built up. At its core, Process Landscape Analysis offers a consolidated view of the processes running in an ERP system by combining several modules of the SAP Signavio Suite. Built on three key components, it allows organizations to understand current process performance, identify process variants, and monitor adherence to target processes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Process House –&lt;/STRONG&gt; Provides a top-down structure for navigating individual processes. It aggregates information at the end-to-end process level and company level, giving stakeholders a complete overview of process execution across the organization.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Individual Processes –&lt;/STRONG&gt; Each process is analyzed for execution, variants, and transaction code usage. The Best-Run Score (BRS) evaluates process effectiveness and efficiency, helping identify high-volume processes that may need optimization.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adherence to Target Processes Analysis –&lt;/STRONG&gt; Compares actual execution with defined target process variants to monitor compliance, enforce standardization, and support the rollout of ERP templates.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Together, these three components create a comprehensive view of your ERP processes, laying the foundation for informed decisions and a successful transformation journey. The following &lt;A href="https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_ydb2ymbx" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;video&lt;/A&gt; shows how it looks like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338837i65B7B86AA9F65633/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture2.png" alt="Picture2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-653032098"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-456518593"&gt;Adherence to Target Processes&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;A cornerstone of the update is the Adherence to Target Processes dashboard, which enables organizations to track harmonization and ensure process adherence in SAP transformation projects. The dashboard comes with the following analysis:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_14clyho9" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Current Process Variants Analysis&lt;/A&gt; – Provides a snapshot of process variants used across organizational units, highlighting inconsistencies and opportunities for standardization.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_wqo6iv84" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Comparison Against Target Processes&lt;/A&gt; – Measures adherence to defined templates, revealing deviations and guiding corrective actions, such as training or process refinement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_zriyv42z" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Assessment of Target Processes&lt;/A&gt; – Identifies rarely or never used variants, enabling deprecation and maintaining a lean ERP template.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For instance, if a rollout introduces a new procurement process, the dashboard shows which units follow the target process, where deviations occur, and which legacy variants may require retirement, ensuring operational efficiency and governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-389087807"&gt;Challenge: Ensuring Consistent Execution Across Organizational Units&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When customers define a template for their ERP system, they typically specify multiple process variants for each process. In each ERP system, customers are running many processes. This is called the ERP-Template. With Plug and Gain Process Landscape Analysis, customers can measure the actual process execution across more than 100 processes right out of the box.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338839i8FC61B882245C50C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture3.png" alt="Picture3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;However, the typical questions customers then ask:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To which extent does our actual process execution match with the ERP template?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Where do we need to reinforce the rollout?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338841i5D0D595EEAC07542/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture4.png" alt="Picture4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;And it’s not enough to see this at a global level. Typical customers have &amp;gt; 1,000 combinations of processes and organizational units&lt;/SPAN&gt;. &lt;SPAN&gt;We need the transparency&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;by process and organizational unit. That’s where the new adherence to target processes dashboard comes in! Within the dashboard customers are able to define specific target process variants for each process (their ERP template) and measure actual execution against that on the level of process and organizational unit. This helps understand how far away from the template the current execution is, if the role out was successful and exactly where it was not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338846i5F020D9DAFA70582/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture6.png" alt="Picture6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-192574302"&gt;Why Process Harmonization Matters&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Process harmonization is essential for consistent, efficient, and compliant operations across an organization. It ensures that business processes are executed uniformly to reduce complexity, improve quality, and drive measurable business outcomes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Successful harmonization strengthens both the&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;top line&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(better customer experience, better financial results, faster execution) and the&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;bottom line&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(cost reduction, standardization, and compliance). Yet, many organizations struggle to achieve this consistency, especially when multiple systems, tools, and organizational units are involved.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--133021922"&gt;SAP Learning Journey available&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, we offer the following&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/courses/mastering-process-harmonization-with-sap-signavio-and-process-landscape-analysis" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Learning Journey&lt;/A&gt;, which provides a comprehensive guide to&amp;nbsp;Process Landscape Analysis, including detailed explanations of each analysis, supporting video tutorials and how it could be applied in SAP Activate..&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="6"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud for Customer Payments - Transition and Future with APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has transitioned&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud for Customer Payments&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;into maintenance mode and removed it from the price list (as of September 2, 2024). The solution will continue to be supported for existing customers under active contracts, but no further development or investments are made. Customers are encouraged to transition to the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;API-based approach&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and On-Premise/Private Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Accounts receivable processes today are often&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;costly, manual, and time-consuming&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

With the new integration using BTE events, those materials can be planned in HANA, which an improved MRP Live performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, if we activate Advanced Planning for a material, and we choose the option PP/DS Display Only for the scope limitation, this material would be planned in ABAP by MRP Live. As of SAP S/4HANA 2025, we can use BTE events to integrate those documents, allowing the material to be planned in HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The setting to activate the integration with BTE can be found in transaction PPHMRPSET, as we can see in &lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 10&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Caetano_9-1762964162951.png" style="width: 842px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339712i637EB3F2278DB251/image-dimensions/842x242/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="842" height="242" role="button" title="Caetano_9-1762964162951.png" alt="Caetano_9-1762964162951.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 10: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Setting to activate Business Transaction Events in MRP Live.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-321710872"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;New BAdIs for MRP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Adjustment of Planned Order Component Data during BOM Explosion&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;PPH_PLDORD_COMP_ADJ):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;This new BAdI allows you to&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;modify the storage location and production supply area of components in planned orders during BOM explosion in the following processes:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Planning run of material requirements planning and master production scheduling&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manual planned order creation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Backflush for repetitive manufacturing without planned order&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Additional Parameters for Navigation Profile&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;MD_NAVIGATION_ADJUST&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":disappointed_face:"&gt;😞&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;With this new BAdI&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;you can change the parameter IDs for transactions which are maintained in Customizing activity&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Define Navigation Profiles&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Navigation profiles enable you to navigate faster and more flexibly between transactions, and with the new BAdI you can use more than only three parameter IDs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--3885352"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Shop-Floor Control&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Besides the already mentioned improvements for MRP, SAP S/4HANA 2025 also brought improvements for Shop-Floor Control, including a better handling for partial consumption posted from EWM, and new technical objects, like RAP Business Objects and Data Products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--146547507"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Partial Consumption and Split for Error Handling for Automatic Goods Movement, COGI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2025 also introduced a new feature that enables partial retrograde goods issue for non-batched and non-serialized components in embedded SAP Extended Warehouse Management, checking availability in the bin of the production supply area during the manufacturing process&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This feature allows postprocessing of error records from automatic goods movements (COGI transaction) only for unavailable quantities of components, and it works for discrete and repetitive manufacturing. It will enable as-is partial goods movement between SAP EWM and production during synchronous goods movement processes, increasing PSA stock control, reducing clerical work, and improving accuracy of stock data. &lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 11&lt;/STRONG&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud has been officially released, and many new feature were delivered for production planning. From UI improvements to the MRP Cockpit Fiori apps to new Business Add-Ins available for MRP and production orders, this blog provides an overview of those new features that are available in the latest SAP S/4HANA release.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1764736193" id="toc-hId-1764738023"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improvements for MRP Cockpit Fiori Apps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Several improvements were delivered for the MRP Cockpit Fiori Apps&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor Material Coverage - Net Segments (&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F0247A')/S31PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F0247A&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor Material Coverage - Net and Individual Segments (&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F2101A')/S31PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F2101A&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Material Coverage (&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F0251A')/S31PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F0251A&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, bringing additional functionalities that util now were only available in the Stock/Requirements List, and also innovations that will mimic features originally available in the MRP List.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1697305407" id="toc-hId-1697307237"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rescheduling and Cancelling of Proposals&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fiori Apps&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor Material Coverage - Net Segments (F0247A)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor Material Coverage - Net and Individual Segments (F2101A)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;were enhanced to display information about the number of rescheduling proposals that were generated for a specific material.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These apps will now display of the number of rescheduling proposals, and new filters were also introduced to allow users to filter for materials with specific rescheduling messages. The following figure shows the new fields and the new filters in the app Monitor Material Coverage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Caetano_0-1762983539297.png" style="width: 938px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339790i121A7E3216936702/image-dimensions/938x336/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="938" height="336" role="button" title="Caetano_0-1762983539297.png" alt="Caetano_0-1762983539297.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 1:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Rescheduling Proposals in Monitor Material Coverage&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fiori app Manage Material Coverage has been also enhanced with new actions that will help users to resolve coverage issues and make sure requirements can be met as planned:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Proposals to reschedule MRP elements to an earlier date (reschedule in)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Proposals to reschedule MRP elements to a later date (reschedule out)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Proposals to cancel MRP elements (cancel process)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following figure shows and example of the action Reschedule Out, for a purchase order with a rescheduling message:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Caetano_1-1762983539298.png" style="width: 938px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339791i2B723269569606B6/image-dimensions/938x401/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="938" height="401" role="button" title="Caetano_1-1762983539298.png" alt="Caetano_1-1762983539298.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 2:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Rescheduling actions in Manage Material Coverage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1500791902" id="toc-hId-1500793732"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Last MRP Run&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fiori Apps&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor Material Coverage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Material Coverage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;were also enhanced to show the date of the last MRP Run, and to allow users to filter for material segments using the date of the Last MRP Run. The following figures show the filter and the field in Monitor Material Coverage and Manage Material Coverage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

Date&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another enhancement to the Monitor Material Coverage and Manage Material Coverage Fiori apps was the introduction of the Planning Time Fence and the possibility to set or change a Manual Time Fence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;New filters and columns for MRP type and planning time fence were added into the Material Coverage app, as we can see in the Figure below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Caetano_4-1762983539300.png" style="width: 939px;"&gt;&lt;img

Type in Monitor Material Coverage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As we can see in Figure 6, Fiori App Manage Material Coverage now can show the Planning Time Fence, and users will also have the possibility to edit the Planning Time Fence. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Caetano_5-1762983539300.png"

Result&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2025 also introduced a new feature called Accept the MRP results, allowing the planner to mark materials for which the MRP result has been already evaluated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A new filter has been already introduced in Fiori App Monitor Material Coverage, so that the planner can filter for material segments where the MRP result has been already accepted or not, and there is also a new column called&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MRP Result Accepted&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as we can see in Figure 7.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span

Fiori App Monitor Material Coverage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fiori app Manage Material Coverage has also been enhanced with a button that allows the planner to Accept the MRP Results, or revoke the Acceptance of MRP results, as shown in&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 8&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span

With the new integration using BTE events, those materials can be planned in HANA, which an improved MRP Live performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, if we activate Advanced Planning for a material, and we choose the option PP/DS Display Only for the scope limitation, this material would be planned in ABAP by MRP Live. As of SAP S/4HANA 2025, we can use BTE events to integrate those documents, allowing the material to be planned in HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The setting to activate the integration with BTE can be found in transaction PPHMRPSET, as we can see in&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 10&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Caetano_9-1762983539303.png" style="width: 695px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339799iF93FCFE70CDFE447/image-dimensions/695x200/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="695" height="200" role="button" title="Caetano_9-1762983539303.png" alt="Caetano_9-1762983539303.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 10:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Setting to activate Business Transaction Events in MRP Live.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-321710872" id="toc-hId-321712702"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;New BAdIs for MRP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Adjustment of Planned Order Component Data during BOM Explosion&amp;nbsp;(PPH_PLDORD_COMP_ADJ):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;This new BAdI allows you to&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;modify the storage location and production supply area of components in planned orders during BOM explosion in the following processes:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Planning run of material requirements planning and master production scheduling&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manual planned order creation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Backflush for repetitive manufacturing without planned order&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Additional Parameters for Navigation Profile&amp;nbsp;(MD_NAVIGATION_ADJUST&lt;SPAN class="lia-unicode-emoji"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":disappointed_face:"&gt;😞&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;With this new BAdI&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;you can change the parameter IDs for transactions which are maintained in Customizing activity&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Define Navigation Profiles&lt;SPAN&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Navigation profiles enable you to navigate faster and more flexibly between transactions, and with the new BAdI you can use more than only three parameter IDs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--3885352" id="toc-hId--3883522"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Shop-Floor Control&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Besides the already mentioned improvements for MRP, SAP S/4HANA 2025 also brought improvements for Shop-Floor Control, including a better handling for partial consumption posted from EWM, and new technical objects, like RAP Business Objects and Data Products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--146547507" id="toc-hId--146545677"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Partial Consumption and Split for Error Handling for Automatic Goods Movement, COGI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2025 also introduced a new feature that enables partial retrograde goods issue for non-batched and non-serialized components in embedded SAP Extended Warehouse Management, checking availability in the bin of the production supply area during the manufacturing process&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This feature allows postprocessing of error records from automatic goods movements (COGI transaction) only for unavailable quantities of components, and it works for discrete and repetitive manufacturing. It will enable as-is partial goods movement between SAP EWM and production during synchronous goods movement processes, increasing PSA stock control, reducing clerical work, and improving accuracy of stock data.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 11&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;shows the setting use to activate this new feature in the Production Scheduling
