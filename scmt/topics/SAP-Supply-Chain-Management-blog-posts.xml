The recent U.S. tariff regime—characterized by sweeping measures such as a 10% duty on all imported goods, dramatic reciprocal tariffs reaching up to 50% on certain countries, and even staggering rates for pivotal markets like China—has redefined the rules of international trade. With effective tariff rates soaring to unprecedented levels, supply chain leaders face persistent uncertainty and escalating costs. In such a challenging environment, the imperative is clear: build resilience that not only absorbs shocks but transforms risk into a competitive advantage. This is where an&amp;nbsp;integrated business planning&amp;nbsp;approach can help&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Integrated Business Planning (IBP) isn’t just about managing data across the supply chain—it’s a holistic approach that integrates commercial, strategic, operational, and digital resilience into your decision-making process. When tariffs surge unpredictably, the effectiveness of your supply chain planning can mean the difference between merely surviving turbulent times and thriving despite adversity. With IBP, companies gain real-time insights, scenario-driven analytics, and the flexibility to dynamically adjust their strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs and shifting market conditions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the heart of IBP is its robust &lt;STRONG&gt;scenario planning&lt;/STRONG&gt; capability—just what’s needed in a world where three potential futures loom large: pragmatic de-escalation with moderated tariffs, a “holding the line” scenario that keeps rates high to pressure trading partners, or a disorderly escalation spiralling into broader economic turmoil. The platform enables organizations to simulate varying scenarios and assess their potential impact on cost structures, supply networks, and market demand—offering a crystal ball of insights that empower proactive planning rather than reactionary adjustments. By incorporating forecasting models and what-if analysis, IBP ensures that your supply chain strategy remains agile as policies shift and the economic landscape transforms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the key advantages of IBP is its capacity to integrate data and processes across the entire supply chain, creating a unified view that connects sourcing, production, inventory, and logistics. Tariff changes can abruptly alter the financial and operational calculus of global trade—from impacting raw material costs in the production phase to the bottom line after goods transit borders. With IBP, decision-makers can swiftly pinpoint which segments of their operations&amp;nbsp;are most vulnerable to tariff volatility and reallocate resources, diversify suppliers, or even consider nearshoring alternatives to mitigate risk. This not only translates into real-time cost tracking but also equips companies with the intelligence needed to adjust procurement and logistics strategies on the fly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In tandem with these operational advantages, IBP also reinforces commercial resilience. As tariff-induced cost pressures ripple through markets, consumer behavior and demand patterns are bound to evolve—often unpredictably. &lt;STRONG&gt;Predictive analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;allow organizations to capture subtle market shifts and forecast changes in consumer demand. Armed with these insights, companies can recalibrate pricing strategies, tailor product assortments, and reassess channel strategies to maintain competitive positioning despite higher costs. In essence, IBP helps businesses not only navigate the immediate pitfalls of tariff hikes but also capitalize on emerging opportunities in a disrupted market.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Digital resilience is another cornerstone of an integrated business planning approach. In today’s fast-paced environment, manual planning and outdated legacy systems simply can’t keep pace with the velocity of change. Instead, leveraging&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;advanced AI algorithms&lt;/STRONG&gt; and real-time data monitoring to provide an agile platform where automated adjustments are the norm rather than the exception. This digital backbone ensures that the supply chain remains not only responsive to sudden policy shifts but also continuously optimized for efficiency. Enhanced &lt;STRONG&gt;transparency across business networks&lt;/STRONG&gt; means that every stakeholder—from procurement managers to financial executives—can access timely, relevant data to inform strategic decisions, thereby reducing the lag between market disruption and adaptive response.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The current tariff landscape is a clarion call for strategic investment in resilient, integrated planning solutions. One of the major innovations that comes into picture is characteristics or attribute-based planning. With &lt;STRONG&gt;attribute-based planning&lt;/STRONG&gt;, each supply element can be tagged with its country of origin, and each demand with its destination-specific trade rules. Now, instead of a one-size-fits-all production and sourcing strategy, the planning system &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/building-resilient-supply-chains-amid-tariff-pressure-with-sap-supply-and/ba-p/14106205" target="_self"&gt;intelligently segments manufacturing and procurement&lt;/A&gt; based on these attributes.&amp;nbsp;Planning and execution should go together, to&amp;nbsp;ensure an uninterrupted process flow between the planning and the execution process from procurement, production, warehousing to final delivery.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, tariff fluctuations can severely disrupt order fulfillment, creating inventory imbalances and increasing lead times. An&lt;STRONG&gt; Advanced Available-to-Promise&lt;/STRONG&gt; (aATP) process ensures that companies meet customer expectations by intelligently managing product availability across a complex, multi-tiered supply network. By leveraging real-time data and demand-driven allocation, aATP dynamically adjusts order commitments, prioritizes profitable customers, and reroutes shipments based on tariff changes and capacity constraints.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By embracing an integrated business planning approach connected to the execution systems, companies position themselves to transform tariff-induced disruption into a catalyst for innovation and improved operational alignment. Rather than being paralyzed by uncertainty, supply chain leaders can harness robust planning tools to create adaptive frameworks that evolve in lockstep with the challenges of global commerce.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now more than ever, the ability to respond quickly and decisively to external shocks is not merely a luxury—it’s a business imperative. With IBP at the core of your supply chain strategy, you’re empowered to reimagine how your organization navigates not just tariffs, but the vast array of disruptions defining this new normal. In the face of rising tariffs and economic unpredictability, let resilience be your competitive edge and innovation your guiding principle.&amp;nbsp;For further guidance, I recommend to listen to this crisp and very recent &lt;A href="https://podcast.opensap.info/the-future-of-supply-chain/2025/05/07/episode-108-transforming-tariff-challenges-into-opportunities-through-better-planning-with-saps-jay-foster-and-lori-harner/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;podcast&lt;/A&gt;: "Transforming Tariff Challenges into Opportunities Through Better Planning with SAP’s Jay Foster and Lori Harner".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tariffs2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/258895iB3E3F83EC1B4759B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Tariffs2.jpg" alt="Tariffs2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;As the landscape of global trade continues to evolve, the possibility of new tariffs is creating waves of concern across the world's supply chains. Whether driven by shifting geopolitical alliances, trade disputes, or protectionist policies, tariffs can dramatically alter the cost-to-serve, disrupt sourcing strategies, and challenge existing supplier relationships. Companies must stay agile and be prepared to adapt their supply networks and fulfilment strategies with speed and precision to protect margins, maintain service levels, and stay competitive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To build a truly responsive supply chain, companies must ensure that trade-related strategies are consistently reflected across all key operational processes—from procurement and manufacturing to logistics, costing, and order fulfilment. Only by creating a unified framework can businesses detect, track, and act on exceptions such as tariff changes, sourcing constraints, or shifts in trade policy. At the heart of this framework lies &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Supply and Demand Segmentation&lt;/STRONG&gt;—a foundational capability that serves as the axle around which all these moving parts revolve.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is SAP Supply and Demand Segmentation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Supply and Demand Segmentation enables companies to plan and execute their supply chain processes considering market and product -specific attributes, without the need of creating lots of SKUs differentiated only by those characteristics. Segmentation based on key characteristics such as country of origin, destination, certifications, and product value, companies can design differentiated, tariff-aware strategies that guide planning, sourcing, and execution decisions with precision.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Segmentation value essentially encapsulates the blueprint of the product and business attributes and can be attached to all supply chain relevant objects or documents. For example, the supply segmentation value can hold the attributes like country of origin and other tariff related parameters along with relevant configuration or logistical characteristics. The demand segmentation value can hold the attributes like country of destination and similar characteristics. The segmentation rules match the demand and supply segmentation values ensuring compliance. These rules are respected throughout end-to-end order-to-cash and supply chain processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration of Supply and Demand Segmentation with end-to-end business processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Supply and Demand Segmentation plays a crucial role in optimizing supply chain operations by integrating seamlessly with various processes to mitigate the risks from tariff related turbulences.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sujeet_Acharya_2-1747722602585.png" style="width: 678px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/263526i090AB8348F6A848E/image-dimensions/678x155?v=v2" width="678" height="155" role="button" title="Sujeet_Acharya_2-1747722602585.png" alt="Sujeet_Acharya_2-1747722602585.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integrated Business Planning&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Characteristics Based Planning with segmentation enables sourcing decisions based on country-of-origin constraints, ensuring compliance with trade regulations and tariff strategies. This approach supports optimal supplier selection, cost control, and supply continuity in volatile trade environments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Procurement&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Purchase orders are generated in alignment with supply and demand segments, ensuring that materials are procured from the most suitable suppliers. By considering tariff related parameters in the supplier segmentation, organizations can minimize exposure to high tariff costs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manufacturing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Segmentation aligns production planning and scheduling with both supply and demand segments, ensuring raw materials are available on time and schedules meet specific customer needs. By factoring in tariffs, companies can strategically plan production in regions with lower duties or favourable trade agreements—optimizing resource use, reducing lead times, and minimizing tariff costs while improving delivery performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inventory Management and Warehousing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With Segmentation, inventory is optimized by aligning stock levels and warehouse placement with product attributes, demand patterns, and tariff exposure. This approach reduces holding and handling costs, improves efficiency, and enhances service by strategically positioning inventory near low-tariff end markets.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quality Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Segmentation enhances quality management by aligning quality checks with product attributes and market-specific regulations. This ensures compliance, reduces defects, and minimizes costs and risks—especially in high-tariff, high-regulation markets.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order Management &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Segmentation in order management enables priority handling based on demand attributes and performs availability checks against segmented inventory and production plans. By factoring in tariffs, the system optimizes fulfilment routes and commitments—boosting service levels while minimizing tariff costs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Product Costing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Product costing can be calculated at the valuation type level using segment values, allowing for more accurate, attribute-based cost insights. This enables better pricing, margin analysis, and tariff impact visibility across differentiated segments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;An example scenario&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s take practical example of how Supply and Demand Segmentation works.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A high-tech company manufactures and distributes electronic components globally. The company sources semiconductors, displays and other hardware from various countries, assembles and sells finished products to multiple international markets. Due to tariffs and trade regulations, it is crucial to segment both supply and demand based on the country of origin and the country of destination, along with other physical configuration or logistical parameters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Sujeet_Acharya_3-1747722661579.png" style="width: 678px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/263527iA10CCC0273105151/image-dimensions/678x255?v=v2" width="678" height="255" role="button" title="Sujeet_Acharya_3-1747722661579.png" alt="Sujeet_Acharya_3-1747722661579.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Supply and demand segmentation helps the company plan sourcing based on tariff exposure, prioritize procurement from low-risk regions, align manufacturing schedules with regional demand needs, and calculate costs based on country-of-origin inputs. In this example, supplies with certain segmentation value can be sold to customers in Europe, but can't be sold to customers from Europe. Thus, segmentation ensures smarter production, lower landed costs, and optimized fulfilment tailored to each market's trade requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In today’s volatile environment, resilience isn't optional; it’s a strategic imperative. Segmentation enables companies to navigate tariff complexities by aligning sourcing, production, and fulfilment strategies with specific trade attributes. This approach minimizes tariff costs, enhances supply chain efficiency, and ensures smarter decision-making, ultimately driving profitability and resilience in global operations.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1859625479"&gt;Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Supplier Evaluation&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The supplier evaluation system in SAP HANA incorporates both hard facts and soft facts. For the hard facts, you need to specify the criteria weightings and assign scores through Customising or via the SAP Fiori app&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supplier Evaluation Weighting and Scoring.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;To select and weight the criteria, choose the app&amp;nbsp;Supplier Evaluation Weighting and Scoring.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;After changing the scores, you must run the report &lt;STRONG&gt;MM_PUR_SEWS_VAR_SCORE_UPDATE&lt;/STRONG&gt; to recalculate the scores.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The following key performance indicators (KPIs) are available for analysis:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#99CC00"&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Overall Supplier Evaluation:&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;This app evaluates a supplier's performance within an organisation by analysing both operational and questionnaire-based scores. The assessment covers data from the previous year up to the present date. It calculates the overall score by combining weighted hard metrics (such as price, delivery time, and quantity) with soft metrics derived from questionnaire responses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#99CC00"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Operational Supplier Evaluation:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;This app calculates a supplier's performance score within an organisation by taking the weighted average of three key metrics: quantity variance, price variance, and time variance. The score is derived from data collected over the past year up to the current date. The overall score is computed by first assessing variances across these criteria and then applying the appropriate weighting. If needed, you can modify the scores using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adjust Operational Supplier Evaluation Score&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#99CC00"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Supplier Evaluation by Quantity:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Supplier Evaluation by Quantity app helps you calculate quantity variance by comparing the ordered quantity with the delivered quantity. Both over-deliveries and under-deliveries are counted as variances. The score is calculated based on data from the previous year up to the current date.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#99CC00"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;Supplier Evaluation by Time:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;This app helps you evaluate a supplier's performance score by analysing the time difference between when items were ordered and when they were delivered. The score is calculated based on data from the previous year to date, considering both early and late deliveries as variances. You can also track delivery time variances by date, with each day's variance counted as one percent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#99CC00"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Supplier Evaluation by Price:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;With the&amp;nbsp;Supplier Evaluation by Price&amp;nbsp;app, you can determine the score of a given supplier in an organisation based on the variance in the price of ordered items and invoiced items. The score is calculated over the previous year to date and is based on the difference between the purchase order amount and the invoice amount. Both the excess price and the lower price are considered as variances. This is completely different to the LIS-based supplier evaluation, where the price score is based on the info record prices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#99CC00"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6.&amp;nbsp;Supplier Evaluation by Quality - Inspection Lot:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Supplier Evaluation by Quality app helps you calculate a supplier’s overall quality score using inspection data. It records each inspection lot and tracks suppliers by purchase order and item. The score is calculated based on data from the previous year up to the current date.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#99CC00"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;Supplier Evaluation by Quality - Quality Notification:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;This app allows you to assess suppliers using a quality-based scoring system determined by the number of complaints received. You can easily identify high-performing suppliers - those with fewer complaints and higher quality scores - helping you determine the most reliable partners. Additionally, if purchasing conditions like material quality, price, quotation, and delivery time are similar, the app assists in selecting the best supplier based on their performance metrics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1663111974"&gt;&lt;U&gt;Questionnaire&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supplier Evaluation by Questionnaire App&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This app allows you to assess supplier performance by calculating evaluation scores based on completed questionnaires. You can compare the actual scores with the supplier’s target score to measure performance. Evaluations are based on data from the previous year up to the current date.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites for Evaluation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Before starting the evaluation process, you need to set up questions and questionnaires.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Manage Questions App&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Use this app to define all questions that will be included in your questionnaires. Follow these steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Define Groups (Optional):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Organise questions into logical sections for better structure&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create Sections:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Group questions by topic for easier navigation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Add Questions:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Specify questions and assign them to groups if needed. You can choose from different question types. For&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;single-answer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;yes/no&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;questions, you must assign scores to each answer option&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Manage Questionnaires App&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Once your questions are ready, use this app to build questionnaires. You can link questionnaires to purchasing categories and structure them with sections and questions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align :

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As SAP Advanced Planning and Optimization (SAP APO) is a component of SAP Supply Chain Management (SAP SCM), and SAP SCM 7.0 will reach the end of mainstream maintenance in the coming years, customers need to plan and migrate from SAP APO to SAP Integrated Business Planning (SAP IBP), leverage the integrated supply chain planning functionality within SAP S/4HANA, or a combination of both.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Today, we proudly announce the general availability of SAP Readiness Check for SAP Supply Chain solutions to assist in planning this transformation. This new SAP Readiness Check scenario provides customers and their partners with insightful information on how SAP APO is used today.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By analysing active SAP APO modules, SAP Readiness Check for SAP Supply Chain solutions supports the definition of the target solution architecture.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="APO grafic.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/266774i05913EB77983FD9B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="APO grafic.png" alt="APO grafic.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Readiness Check for SAP Supply Chain solutions provides customers, implementation partners, and SAP consultants visibility on how the existing SAP APO modules, like SAP APO Demand Planning, SAP APO Supply Network Planning, SAP APO Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling, and Global Available-to-Promise, are implemented, tailored, and consumed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unlike the existing verification points presented by SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA, where the checks reveal “must-dos” in support of a possible conversion project to SAP S/4HANA, SAP Readiness Check for SAP Supply Chain solutions is purely informative and is intended to be used as input for discussions between customers, their partners, and SAP to identify the best-fitting target architecture,&amp;nbsp;as well as to help scope initial effort estimations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is SAP Integrated Business Planning (SAP IBP)?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Integrated Business Planning (SAP IBP) solution is a cloud-based supply chain planning solution that scales to accommodate business growth and integrates with other SAP and third-party systems. It integrates key aspects of the planning process, including demand, supply, inventory, and sales and operations planning (S&amp;amp;OP). Designed to help you streamline planning and improve performance, SAP IBP supports data-driven decision-making and simplified collaboration to increase operational efficiency. SAP IBP delivers this with the help of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and powerful optimisation algorithms that enable real-time visibility, better forecasting, and faster decision-making across the entire supply chain.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For further information, check the &lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/integrated-business-planning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Integrated Business Planning Community&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supply chain planning &lt;SPAN&gt;functionality available in SAP S/4HANA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA ePPDS &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA offers Embedded PP/DS, which brings the SAP APO capabilities into the SAP ERP core. Embedded PP/DS brings many advantages, such as simplified master data maintenance, simplified integration, and planning PP/DS materials in MRP Live. &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The major innovation, however, is related to the user interface with SAP Fiori apps for capacity monitoring and capacity leveling. The SAP Fiori app &lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor Capacity Utilization&lt;/STRONG&gt; provides an overview of the capacity load in the resources assigned to the area of responsibility and a detailed capacity overview of a selected resource, including charts and additional details of the capacity load.&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For further information, see &lt;A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2019/01/15/s4hana-embedded-ppds-shift-maintenance-in-monitor-capacity-fiori-app./" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;S/4HANA Embedded PP/DS: Shift Maintenance in Monitor Capacity Fiori App. | SAP Blogs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA aATP &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Advanced Available-to-Promise (aATP) is a business function in&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;that responds to order fulfillment requests in&amp;nbsp;Sales&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Production Planning. &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;An order fulfillment request consists of the required material, plant, requested quantity, and material availability date.

The note provides detailed and technical information on how to set up and perform the analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Initiate program RC_SCM_COLLECT_ANALYSIS_DATA via transaction SA38 or SE38 to initialize the data collectors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="collect.png" style="width: 526px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/266796iC55D383C4A97C4D1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="collect.png" alt="collect.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select the scope of the analysis by activating or deactivating the corresponding checkboxes. Use the &lt;EM&gt;Schedule Analysis &lt;/EM&gt;button to schedule the data collection. The process runs as a background job to avoid timeout issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The runtime of the data collectors depends on many factors, like server capacity, data volumes, and component usage. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the runtime. The data collection process was intentionally designed to avoid contention or interference with production workloads; consequently, you may see longer than expected runtimes. The best way to forecast the runtime for a production system is to conduct the data collection process in a copy of production using a similar hardware configuration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the analysis has finished, you can download the results to your local filesystem using the &lt;EM&gt;Download Analysis Data&lt;/EM&gt; button. The generated data collection archive is a ZIP file containing multiple XML files. All collected data is human-readable and can be easily inspected with appropriate XML viewers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Launch the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/readinesscheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Readiness Check cloud application on SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt; or from within your SAP Cloud ALM tenant and choose &lt;STRONG&gt;Start New Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt; to upload the ZIP archive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;After a few seconds, the results of the newly created SAP Readiness Check analysis can be explored.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As always, we look forward to receiving your feedback!&lt;BR /&gt;Your SAP Readiness Check Team&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In continuation of my previous blogs where we covered the topics of the usage of Data crawler and Integration of TM and ARM (Advanced Returns Management), this blog we are going to showcase the process flow on the Integration of TM &amp;amp; GTS in the S/4 HANA system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are going to focus on the Outward movement of Goods when there will be cross-border movement of goods from source country to destination country that are different.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One way to identify the cross-border process is the country of Plant from where goods are dispatched and the country of Ship to party to where goods are dispatched to. If both countries are different then it constitutes a cross -border movement and hence a separate set up can be done based on the Distribution Channel – Exports.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While discussing on the topic of Integration of TM and GTS, there are two areas that come in this domain:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Perform compliance checks on business transaction documents of TM like Freight Order, Freight Booking and Forwarding Order in GTS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Handle customs processing for business documents of TM like Freight Order, Freight Booking and Forwarding Order in GTS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog will focus on the customs processing of Freight Order where export declaration request is triggered in the Freight Order in TM and send to SAP GTS which in turn will create a Customs Export Declaration document in GTS and is subsequently sent to the customs broker. The customs broker then submits the export declaration document to the Customs Authority.

Hence, the PGI step is performed now.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, it all depends on how the business operates in their domain and how the export process they want to map as per their requirement. This is purely a standard flow that we are showcasing here which can be taken up a base for further exploration to suit to your customer specific business operations. This process can be automated with the addition of custom functionality which is not covered in this blog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this Customs Export Declaration Process, SAP has provided four Webservice Interface messages to perform tasks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="668"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="345"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;webservice Interface message&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="323"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Task&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="345"&gt;&lt;P&gt;ExportDeclarationSUITERequest_Out&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="323"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This message is triggered from FO in TM and create a Customs Export Declaration document in GTS which is then submitted to customs authority.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="345"&gt;&lt;P&gt;ExportDeclarationSUITECancellationRequest_Out&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="323"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This message is triggered from FO in TM and cancels either already approved Customs Export&amp;nbsp; Declaration document or cancels Customs Export Declaration document which is submitted or in review with customs authority.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="345"&gt;&lt;P&gt;ExportDeclarationSUITEConfirmatio_In (Approval)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="323"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This message is triggered from GTS and it approves the export declaration request and update the status in the FO in TM once customs authority provides its approval.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="345"&gt;&lt;P&gt;ExportDeclarationSUITEConfirmatio_In (Cancellation)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="323"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This message is triggered from GTS and it cancels the export declaration request and update the status in the FO in TM once customs authority provides its approval.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this, we have come to the end of the blog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog gives a glimpse of the process flow of Integration of TM with GTS in terms of customs export declarations process in digital mode.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Appreciate if any one can share the feedback or suggestions on this blog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Managing physical inventory efficiently ensures accurate stock levels and smooth warehouse operations. SAP S/4HANA introduces a powerful tool -&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Situation Handling -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;that enables proactive issue detection and response during the physical inventory process. With situation types like &lt;STRONG&gt;SPHYSINVMO&lt;/STRONG&gt;, users can receive timely alerts about pending or delayed inventory activities, helping them to act swiftly and maintain stock accuracy. In this blog, we learn how to configure situation handling for physical inventory, assign responsible teams, and leverage SAP Fiori apps to stay ahead of operational issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitoring SAP Event Management Extraction Queues&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In previous cases, SAP Event Management (EM) extraction queues in application systems have experienced sudden growth. These queues refer to RFC outbound queues in any application system connected to an SAP EM system (e.g., "EM_TMS_TOR", "EM_ESC_DELIV"), which can be viewed in transaction SMQ1.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Problem Overview:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When this growth occurs, the queue may still appear to be running without errors, and this can lead to confusion. Customers might assume an issue has occurred and contact SAP Support to investigate the sudden growth. In most cases, however, this issue arises when a queue reaches &lt;FONT color="#993366"&gt;a saturation point: more new entries are created than are processed and removed from the queue&lt;/FONT&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Two key factors contribute to this situation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The number of new entries created (related to application object changes and event messages sent).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The processing time for entries in the SAP EM system (the RFC destination system).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, these variables are usually not visible to users and administrators, and they may not be aware of the queue approaching saturation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution Overview:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To help administrators monitor queue health and detect when a queue is approaching saturation, we’ve introduced a development that provides visibility into the number of calls to the SAP EM system and into the number of processed objects and the time required for processing queue entries in the SAP EM system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This solution is delivered via two SAP Notes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Note &lt;A href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3516253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3516253&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: To be implemented in the application system (where the outbound queues reside).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Note &lt;A href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3513421" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3513421&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: To be implemented in the SAP EM system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Important:&lt;/STRONG&gt; These notes cannot be implemented manually or through the SAP Note Assistant. You must implement the referenced Support Packages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Features of the SAP Notes:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Note 3516253 - Queue Health Monitoring in the Application System:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This note introduces the ability to monitor the "health" of EM extraction queues. Health, in this context, refers to the ratio of idle versus busy times for a queue.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transaction /SAPTRX/MONQH&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Used to monitor queue health.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BerndSieger_0-1741175123870.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/233271i0061A6E5AB97BC40/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="BerndSieger_0-1741175123870.png" alt="BerndSieger_0-1741175123870.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Queue&amp;nbsp;Name&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The name of the queue.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;RFC Destination&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The destination system for RFC communication (note that it is case-sensitive).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No. of days the job runs&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Specifies the number of days to monitor.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sample Interval (seconds)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Determines how often the queue status is checked.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Stopping an active monitoring process is done within the same transaction (use the inactive button ("Stop monitoring process") as shown in the interface).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Note 3513421 - Evaluation in SAP EM System:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This note provides evaluation functions within the SAP EM system and includes start/stop functionality for BAPI performance monitoring.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transaction /SAPTRX/EVALQH&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Used to evaluate monitoring data from the application system.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BerndSieger_1-1741175862965.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/233276i0CADCA18FCADE892/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="BerndSieger_1-1741175862965.png" alt="BerndSieger_1-1741175862965.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application System&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The system configured in your SAP EM customizing (configured via transaction SPRO → SAP Reference IMG → Event Management → General Settings → Define Application System).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Queue Name&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;RFC Destination&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Correspond to the parameters used in the &lt;STRONG&gt;/SAPTRX/MONQH&lt;/STRONG&gt; transaction (again: RFC Destination is case-sensitive!).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Start/End Date&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Defines the subset of the monitoring data you are evaluating.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Idle% Threshold&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Defines the minimum percentage of idle time to consider the queue "healthy." The default might fit, but you can adapt it if you either would like to be alerted early or if you want to prevent small spikes to raise alarms.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sample% Threshold&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Used to exclude days with insufficient sample data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;After executing the evaluation, you can view the results:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BerndSieger_0-1741177912301.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/233287iE2D51C748ACEEB71/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="BerndSieger_0-1741177912301.png" alt="BerndSieger_0-1741177912301.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Idle Counter&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Counts the number of times the queue has been idle.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Busy Counter&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Counts the number of times the queue has been busy (including error statuses).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Idle Percentage&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Shows the ratio of idle to total samples.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sample Percentage&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Displays the number of samples taken compared to the maximum number of samples within the evaluation period.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Red fields indicate values lower than the Idle% Threshold. Grayed out fields relate to an insufficient number of samples, compared to the Sample% Threshold.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data can be exported to a spreadsheet for further analysis or graphical representation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can schedule &lt;STRONG&gt;/SAPTRX/EVALQH&lt;/STRONG&gt; to run periodically in the background. If any &lt;STRONG&gt;Idle Percentage&lt;/STRONG&gt; falls below the set threshold, the job will be marked as "error status," enabling automatic monitoring for potential issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BAPI Performance Monitoring:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To gain further insights into queue health, the &lt;STRONG&gt;BAPI Performance Monitoring&lt;/STRONG&gt; function can be used. This feature makes previously hidden variables visible, helping administrators perform root cause analysis if queue health deteriorates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Report /SAPTRX/ACT_PMON&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Starts/stops BAPI performance monitoring.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BerndSieger_0-1741179056704.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/233299i13EB385558EA7390/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="BerndSieger_0-1741179056704.png" alt="BerndSieger_0-1741179056704.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The system records the number of objects processed and the time required for each BAPI call (&lt;STRONG&gt;/SAPTRX/BAPI_EH_POST&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;/SAPTRX/BAPI_EH_ADDEVENTMSG_02&lt;/STRONG&gt;), as well as additional information about the process type and the source of the call.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Monitoring provides insight into performance, helping to identify bottlenecks.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Report /SAPTRX/EVAL_PMON&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Evaluates BAPI performance data.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BerndSieger_0-1741683143860.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/235566i7C7B44D6FBE49EE2/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="BerndSieger_0-1741683143860.png" alt="BerndSieger_0-1741683143860.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can filter data by &lt;STRONG&gt;BAPI Type&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Origin/Sender&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;Process Type&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Threshold time per object (ms)&lt;/STRONG&gt; allows you to define acceptable processing times and highlight underperforming calls. With that parameter you can easily spot low performance in the resulting table:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="BerndSieger_0-1741180406048.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/235745i0210DAC112435830/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="BerndSieger_0-1741180406048.png" alt="BerndSieger_0-1741180406048.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Details:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Queue Health Monitoring (Application System):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The monitoring process is implemented as asynchronous RFC, running at intervals defined by the &lt;STRONG&gt;Sample interval&lt;/STRONG&gt; parameter.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This process is lightweight and should not impact system performance, even when monitoring multiple queues.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To check the status of the monitoring process, you can use transaction &lt;STRONG&gt;/SAPTRX/MONQH&lt;/STRONG&gt; or look for locks on &lt;STRONG&gt;table /SAPTRX/MONQH&lt;/STRONG&gt; (via transaction SM21).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The user starting a monitoring process needs the authorization for transaction SMQ1. The RFC user reading the monitoring data (the evaluation program in the SAP EM system is triggering the RFC) also needs this authorization.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BAPI Performance Monitoring:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Monitoring is based on calls to the &lt;STRONG&gt;/SAPTRX/BAPI_EH_POST&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;/SAPTRX/BAPI_EH_ADDEVENTMSG_02&lt;/STRONG&gt; BAPIs. Only runtime data for successful executions will be recorded.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No DB locking issues are expected, and the impact on system performance is minimal.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;An "empty" BAPI call (e. g. created with the test function of transaction SE37 or with custom code) has zero objects, but for the "&lt;STRONG&gt;Time per Object&lt;/STRONG&gt;" calculation it will be treated as having one object.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;There currently is no support for the way an SAP Object Event Repository implementation (SAP EM 9.20 only) will affect the number of objects in a BAPI call. If you are using SAP OER it is recommended to filter out the related &lt;STRONG&gt;Process Types&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the evaluation report.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The processing of repost data from the tables /SAPTRX/RP_* or of event messages from table /SAPTRX/LOCKEDEH (see SAP Note &lt;A href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/656990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;656990&lt;/A&gt;) will not be monitored. The assumption is that any performance changes regarding BAPI executions will affect the processing from those sources in the exact same way.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The volume of the DB tables used for both, queue health monitoring in the application system and BAPI performance monitoring in the SAP EM system, is supposed to stay negligible, due to the aggregation of data on day level.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Irregular Monitoring Cancellations:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The monitoring process may be cancelled due to system conditions (e.g., application server restart, resource issues). If this occurs, you can use the &lt;STRONG&gt;/SAPTRX/MON_QH_RESTARTER&lt;/STRONG&gt; program to restart the monitoring process automatically.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The program will attempt to resume monitoring based on the remaining days, though precision of the scheduling is limited to one day (-&amp;gt; you might monitor slightly longer than originally intended).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If there are frequent cancellations,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;/SAPTRX/MON_QH_RESTARTER&lt;/STRONG&gt; should be scheduled as a periodic job.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These developments allow you to monitor the health of EM extraction queues and evaluate the performance of BAPI calls, providing greater visibility into the system. By implementing the recommended SAP Notes (or rather the referenced Support Packages) and using the associated transactions, administrators can proactively manage system performance, identify bottlenecks, and maintain optimal queue health.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Today's logistics environment can feel like constantly navigating through a storm. Supply chain disruptions, unexpected market volatility, ongoing labor challenges, and the relentless pressure of customer expectations... these make even thinking about process and performance improvement more challenging when most of your energy is going into trying to ride out the storm. How do you find your way not just to calmer waters, but to rise to a level of operational excellence?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The journey begins with &lt;STRONG&gt;understanding where you are right now&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Drawing on insights from industry experts, including collaboration with &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-gonzalez-063530/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Adrian Gonzalez&lt;/A&gt; of &lt;A href="https://adelantescm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Adelante SCM&lt;/A&gt;, the latest &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/04/5a01c68e-027f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.urc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model&lt;/A&gt; offers a powerful framework to help you chart your course to logistics excellence. The model serves as a simple yet essential tool for self-assessment and planning for progress in transportation management and collaboration across your logistics ecosystem. The model delves into key areas of your logistics capabilities, helping you pinpoint strengths and weaknesses, ultimately to identify areas where you can and must improve to compete in today’s global market.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Logistics leaders face myriad, intertwined internal and external challenges:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;External Forces:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Fragile supply chains, global conflicts/trade wars, rising energy prices, trade lane bottlenecks, workforce dynamics, technology acceleration, the race to carbon zero, and the cost of capital.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Internal Struggles:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Manual, error-prone processes, a focus on firefighting, complex and outdated system landscapes, data silos leading to limited business insights, a lack of end-to-end process coverage, and missing freight visibility.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, with day-to-day challenges, why take the time to apply a maturity model to your planning for process and performance improvement? It provides a structured way to &lt;STRONG&gt;assess your current state&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;benchmark your capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;define your target destination&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;chart a strategic course&lt;/STRONG&gt; to get there. It both digs into your day-to-day challenges, and rises above them to provide a bird’s eye view. It helps you connect specific operational improvements to real business outcomes like reducing costs, enhancing agility, and boosting customer satisfaction. It supports strategic thinking, with tactical application into your capabilities and competencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s break-down how this maturity model will help to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Assess your current state:&lt;/STRONG&gt; It helps you understand where you truly stand across those five critical dimensions. This self-assessment is the crucial first step to identifying specific areas where you need to grow.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benchmark capabilities:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You can see how your capabilities align with defined stages of maturity, offering context for your current position and highlighting what's possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Define your target state:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The model helps you visualize the capabilities that define higher levels of maturity, allowing you to set a clear goal for where you aspire to be based on your strategic business objectives.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Chart a strategic path:&lt;/STRONG&gt; It lays out the logical steps required to progress from your current level to your desired future state, guiding your "what's next" planning discussions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Over the next four posts, we'll explore what this journey looks like at each stage, from basic foundational steps to the most advanced levels of operation. We'll discuss:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The starting line:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Understanding and improving manual processes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Gaining traction:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Leveraging early digitalization for greater visibility.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Building momentum:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Integrating processes for enhanced resilience.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reaching the summit:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Achieving autonomous orchestration and competitive advantage.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s not a race, but it is like climbing a mountain. And progressing along the model only matters when you maintain a focus on business value – when you determine that your logistics operations must not only improve to support business growth, but can transform into a competitive advantage for growth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ready to see how the &lt;STRONG&gt;Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model&lt;/STRONG&gt; can guide your transformation?

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In many industries such as pharmaceuticals, food &amp;amp; beverage, and chemicals, it is common for the same material to vary slightly in weight or volume between batches due to manufacturing or environmental conditions. Traditional inventory management methods, which assume uniform units of measure across all batches, fall short in such scenarios. SAP addresses this challenge with the &lt;STRONG&gt;Batch Specific Unit of Measure (UoM) functionality.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Batch Specific UoM allows users to maintain batch-dependent conversion factors between different units of measure (such as between Rolls and Metre), making inventory more accurate and business operations more transparent. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with variable-weight items or when regulatory compliance requires batch-specific tracking.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Scenario:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;A garment manufacturing company procures fabric rolls from different suppliers. Although the ordering unit is “Rolls”, each roll can differ in usable area (in m²) depending on fabric thickness, stretching, or cutting tolerance. The actual area of fabric available per roll is batch-specific and must be tracked for accurate inventory and production planning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Problem without Batch Specific UoM:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;If every roll is assumed to contain a fixed m², it leads to inaccurate raw material planning, over- or under-consumption in BOMs, and errors in stock valuation or costing. This becomes a significant issue when each roll is priced based on the usable area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution with Batch Specific UoM:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;By enabling Batch Specific UoM in SAP, the company can maintain the actual square meters per roll as a batch-specific conversion. During Goods Receipt, the user records the true m² of fabric in each roll, allowing the system to reflect the correct inventory in both Rolls and m². This ensures precise material consumption, correct stock values, and better production efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the following sections of this blog, we will walk through:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Configuration of Batch Specific UoM via IMG paths&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creation of characteristics and class to store batch-specific values&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Material master setup with proportional UoM&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Recording batch-specific quantities during purchase and Goods Receipt&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Viewing inventory in both base and alternative UoMs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This functionality helps businesses gain better control over variable-material inventories and supports compliance with industry-specific textile and clothing production standards.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-2120409863"&gt;Step 1: Create Unit Measure (Transaction:

    <content>&lt;P&gt;If your daily logistics operations are heavily reliant on phone calls, emails, spreadsheets, and folders full of paper, you're likely operating at what &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/04/5a01c68e-027f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.urc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model&lt;/A&gt; characterizes as Level 1, the "&lt;STRONG&gt;Manual&lt;/STRONG&gt;" stage. At this stage, strategic planning is minimal, and tactical transacting and reacting to issues consume most of your effort. Collaboration with carriers and partners is typically limited to one-to-one communication methods, making real-time visibility a significant challenge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please read on to see how the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/supply-chain-logistics-maturity-model-introduction-chart-your-course-1-of-5/ba-p/14127455" target="_blank"&gt;prior post describing the purpose and framework for the maturity model&lt;/A&gt; specifically applies to companies at Level 1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to industry surveys, a substantial portion of companies still rely on manual communication methods. At Level 1, these characteristics are prevalent:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Primary reliance on phone, email, and spreadsheets&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Little logistics integration with related fulfillment processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reactive with minimal strategic planning or advanced optimization&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For companies at this level, the Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model is particularly valuable. It helps you explicitly &lt;STRONG&gt;see where you stand&lt;/STRONG&gt; and highlights the &lt;STRONG&gt;low-hanging fruit&lt;/STRONG&gt; for improvement. Identifying manual processes, areas with excessive paper handling, or moments where data is being re-typed from one system to another are clear indicators of areas needing attention.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The primary focus for improvement at Level 1 is &lt;STRONG&gt;gaining efficiency&lt;/STRONG&gt;. But where and how do you start? The model points towards digitalization and automation as key first steps. This isn't about finding a "perfect solution" right away; it's about starting with specific areas where you can quickly drive value. By digitalizing basic transportation processes like booking and tendering, or gaining some initial visibility beyond external portals, you lay the crucial groundwork needed to move up the maturity curve. Leveraging the model helps you pinpoint &lt;EM&gt;which&lt;/EM&gt; manual processes to tackle first to gain that initial, much-needed efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;Stay tuned for the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/supply-chain-logistics-maturity-model-gaining-traction-amp-leveraging/ba-p/14139121#M7465" target="_blank"&gt;next post, where we'll explore how companies at Level 2 have built a foundation&lt;/A&gt; for greater efficiency, and begin to leverage visibility to become more proactive&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;(&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/supply-chain-logistics-maturity-model-introduction-chart-your-course-1-of-5/ba-p/14127455" target="_blank"&gt;prior post in this series&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More in-depth reading:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2025/06/four-strategies-mature-supply-chain-logistics-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Decoding Supply Chain Logistics: Four Strategies to Mature Your Logistics Operations&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/05/d832e680-097f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Insights to Action eBook: Chart your path to logistics excellence&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/05/d832e680-097f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Doug_DeLuca_0-1750449334178.png" style="width: 776px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/277259iD069E9D0988B1A47/image-dimensions/776x436?v=v2" width="776" height="436" role="button" title="Doug_DeLuca_0-1750449334178.png" alt="Doug_DeLuca_0-1750449334178.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In SAP Materials Management, &lt;STRONG&gt;Vendor Sub-Range&lt;/STRONG&gt; allows the differentiation of procurement parameters for the same vendor across different plants, currencies, or business needs. This is particularly helpful when a single vendor operates in multiple regions or supports various product lines, currencies, or supply channels.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Example:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Consider vendor &lt;STRONG&gt;10053 – "Vendor Subrange Test Vendor"&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which is registered under &lt;STRONG&gt;Purchase Organisation 1000&lt;/STRONG&gt; with a default order currency of&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAR&lt;/STRONG&gt;. However, this vendor also supports additional currencies like &lt;STRONG&gt;USD &lt;/STRONG&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;EUR&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the same or different plants:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant 1000&lt;/STRONG&gt; – USD&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant 1000&lt;/STRONG&gt; – EUR&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plant 2000&lt;/STRONG&gt; – INR&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;To handle such multi-currency procurement scenarios without creating multiple vendor masters, SAP provides &lt;STRONG&gt;Vendor Sub-Ranges (VSR)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Using VSR, you can assign different &lt;STRONG&gt;currencies&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;partner functions&lt;/STRONG&gt;, or &lt;STRONG&gt;conditions&lt;/STRONG&gt; per sub-range while linking them to a single vendor code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step-by-Step Configuration and Process Guide for Vendor Sub-Range&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-2120501992"&gt;Step 1: Activate Vendor Sub-Range Field&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;SPRO Path:&amp;nbsp;SPRO → SAP Reference IMG → Logistics - General → Business Partner → Vendors → Control → Define Account Groups and Field Selection (Vendor)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Purpose:&amp;nbsp;Ensure the Vendor Sub-Range field is active for the &lt;STRONG&gt;vendor account group&lt;/STRONG&gt; so it appears during master data maintenance (especially in the Purchasing view of BP).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Leelamohan_0-1750731116949.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/277906iBEF7FE3E9B022F6F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Leelamohan_0-1750731116949.png" alt="Leelamohan_0-1750731116949.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Leelamohan_1-1750731137196.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/277907i4DCB884E3EF487A0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Leelamohan_1-1750731137196.png" alt="Leelamohan_1-1750731137196.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1923988487"&gt;Step 2: Create Business Partner (Vendor Master) (App: Manage Business Partner)&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go to BP and open/create the vendor (e.g., 11053).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Under &lt;STRONG&gt;Purchasing View&lt;/STRONG&gt;, go to the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Vendor Subranges"&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Maintain entries for different sub-ranges like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;VSRT1&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Currency EUR&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;VSRT2&lt;/STRONG&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;For companies that have moved beyond purely manual processes and have implemented a basic transportation management system (TMS), &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/04/5a01c68e-027f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.urc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model&lt;/A&gt; places them around Level 2, "&lt;STRONG&gt;Somewhat Digitalized&lt;/STRONG&gt;". At this level, you have core capabilities like load consolidation and booking management in place, but with limited point-to-point connections with a few partners, likely via traditional EDI. Nonetheless, communication often still defaults to emails and phone calls, especially when circumstances deviate from plans and annual &amp;nbsp;contracts. Visibility into routes, rates, shipment status, and up-to-date ETAs are available, but often require logging into and navigating through multiple external portals for each carrier, separate from your core order management systems and fulfillment processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Companies at Level 2 have begun their digital journey, but key limitations remain:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TMS processes cover load consolidation, tendering, and booking with limited carrier collaboration&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Limited visibility into shipment status and risk derived from multiple external portals disconnected from fulfillment&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Some cross-functional integration and proactivity but gaps preventing process optimization and digital collaboration&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;At this stage, you have some pieces of the puzzle digitalized, but they aren't fully connected, and therefore fail to provide the comprehensive, real-time insights needed for truly proactive decision-making.&amp;nbsp; For this reason, the primary focus for improvement shifts to leveraging &lt;STRONG&gt;logistics&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;and process integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; to improve agility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Level 2 companies must focus on connecting more trading partners digitally, while maintaining efficiency at scale, and integrating visibility data directly into their logistics systems as well as the order management processes of their ERP. Moving beyond limited point-to-point connections to a business network becomes essential for scalable collaboration. This enhanced connectivity enables more near real-time data exchange for processes like tendering, ordering, and tracking, allowing companies to avoid chasing email and stopping to log into external portals. &lt;STRONG&gt;By integrating visibility &lt;EM&gt;into&lt;/EM&gt; internal systems, you can start identifying issues in the context of your business, and addressing them along your embedded processes &lt;EM&gt;before&lt;/EM&gt; they become major disruptions, setting the stage for greater resilience&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Return for the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/supply-chain-logistics-maturity-model-building-momentum-connecting/ba-p/14146433" target="_blank"&gt;next installment that dives into how companies at Level 3 build on this foundation&lt;/A&gt; to become truly &lt;STRONG&gt;connected and proactive&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;(&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/supply-chain-logistics-maturity-model-find-your-footing-at-level-1-2-of-5/ba-p/14133544" target="_blank"&gt;prior post in this series&lt;/A&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Read more about logistics visibility:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/bringing-logistics-visibility-into-focus/ba-p/13547870" target="_blank"&gt;What is logistics visibility?&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.inboundlogistics.com/articles/achieving-effective-logistics-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Inbound Logistics magazine:&amp;nbsp;10 Tips to Effective Logistics Visibility&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why choose SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace over individual visibility platforms?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2024/08/ea59e90b-d47e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Brief&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/why-choose-sap-business-network-global-track-and-trace-over-individual/ba-p/13984691" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Community post series&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/global-track-and-trace/product-tour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Product Tour:&amp;nbsp;SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/global-track-and-trace/product-tour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Doug_DeLuca_0-1751057529219.png" style="width: 975px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/279916iDB4102B89D3D4AD9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Doug_DeLuca_0-1751057529219.png" alt="Doug_DeLuca_0-1751057529219.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Companies operating at Level 3, the "&lt;STRONG&gt;Connected and Proactive&lt;/STRONG&gt;" stage in &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/04/5a01c68e-027f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.urc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model&lt;/A&gt;, have established a strong supply chain logistics foundation that they leverage to maintain their position in competitive markets. Delivering goods on-time and in full enters into their brand identity and begins to offer a competitive advantage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;They have typically mastered advanced TMS capabilities for optimization, dynamic routing, and even some predictive analytics. Logistics management workflows are highly automated, minimizing the need for manual intervention, while automated alerts draw attention when and where attention is needed. Critically, these companies are often connected to a business network, enabling real-time data exchange with most carriers and partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Visibility is robust, often encompassing shipment and order tracking, location and route risk, and emissions and sustainability.&amp;nbsp; Visibility is also integrated into core systems, providing continuously updated ETAs and delay impact assessments integrated with core processes for planning, production, and fulfillment. Leaving core order management processes to seek information from another platform is rare, intentionally avoided to keep all critical information at hand, inside the ERP landscape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Companies at Level 3 have achieved significant connectivity and automation, including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced TMS capabilities, including load and route optimization, contracting and settlement collaboration with partners, and predictive analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Real-time shipment and risk visibility integrated with fulfillment process tracking&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cross-functional planning, optimization, and synchronization&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Having achieved significant efficiency and visibility, the improvement focus at Level 3 turns towards maximizing &lt;STRONG&gt;resilience&lt;/STRONG&gt;. While you may be well-connected and proactive within your own operations, reaching the next level means leveraging that connectivity for integrated planning and deeper collaboration across the entire ecosystem to weather a storm that may weaken any link along the chain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The maturity model maintains that the height of Level 3 companies have mastered integrated planning and execution from internal systems (ERP, WMS, Yard Management, etc.) across to carrier and freight forwarder systems, to drive key outcomes like on-time, in-full delivery. For companies at this stage, it becomes clear that utilizing a business network is not just for raw data exchange, but for more collaborative processes, such as joint planning or optimization opportunities with partners, as well as global execution monitoring and performance benchmarking. Enhancing automation further, through AI for example, becomes the objective to reach maximum efficiency, freeing up resources for more strategic imperatives. By deepening these connections and automating more complex workflows, &lt;STRONG&gt;companies at Level 3 not only become far more responsive and resilient to the volatile, unpredictable nature of today's global supply chain, but set themselves up for the most mature level in the model&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;In our final post&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we'll look at the pinnacle of logistics maturity – &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;achieving autonomous orchestration&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; – using this level as a benchmark for excellence.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/supply-chain-logistics-maturity-model-gaining-traction-amp-leveraging/ba-p/14139121" target="_blank"&gt;prior post in this series&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;More on these topics –&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP customers that have connected the dots:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2025/02/9e3fa208-f37e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Celsa UK&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Enabling closer collaboration with carriers to create a future-ready supply chain network&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2025/02/f8a51d6c-f47e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bondalti&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Transforming logistics processes to better manage transportation, yard operations, and carrier collaboration&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2025/03/5eebc8d8-f97e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;LAPP&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Keeping industries moving by delivering certainty in an unpredictable world with enhanced supply chain visibility&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/12/8c40be2a-9e7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Al Dahra&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Driving growth in agribusiness through greater supply chain visibility and collaboration on one standardized platform&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/04/e2752f80-6f7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BSH&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Focusing on data visibility, transparency, and process optimization&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2024/03/52d84da8-b07e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hitachi Energy&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Increasing efficiency and improving agility for a more sustainable, risk-resilient supply chain&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/10/c07c8a52-947e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Blue Diamond Growers:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Digitalizing the world’s largest almond cooperative&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/transportation-logistics/product-tour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Product Tour: SAP Transportation Management&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Doug_DeLuca_0-1751920331840.png" style="width: 810px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/283637i0EE9C25DF0E2A345/image-dimensions/810x483?v=v2" width="810" height="483" role="button" title="Doug_DeLuca_0-1751920331840.png" alt="Doug_DeLuca_0-1751920331840.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;If the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that uncertainty is the new normal. Supply chain leaders have navigated a relentless series of shocks—geopolitical upheaval, climate extremes, and rapid technological change. In the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.weforum.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;World Economic Forum’s&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;latest white paper, “&lt;A href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/from-shock-to-strategy-building-value-chains-for-the-next-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;From Shock to Strategy: Building Value Chains for the Next 30 Years&lt;/A&gt;,” the message is clear:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1863347400"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;"The era of linear, globalized value chains is over. The future belongs to those who can build resilience, agility, and sustainability into the very DNA of their operations."&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1537751176"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1341237671"&gt;Why Supply Chains Must Change&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s start with the big picture. The WEF’s Global Future Council on Advanced Manufacturing and Value Chains has mapped out a future where “the only certainty is uncertainty”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Gone are the days when manufacturers could rely on a predictable, globalized model. Today, 90% of industry leaders are shifting toward regionalization and dual sourcing strategies. Headlines about trade wars, cyberattacks, and climate disasters aren’t just background noise, they’re the new operating environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Council’s white paper frames the conversation around three time horizons—2030, 2040, and 2050—each with its own challenges and opportunities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The goal? To help companies move from reactive shock management to proactive, strategic value chain design.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1144724166"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-948210661"&gt;Eight Forces Shaping the Future&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the heart of the report there are eight powerful forces that will shape&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;supply chains&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;through 2050:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Global Relations and Trade:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Regionalization is replacing globalization as companies hedge against&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2025/02/26/tech-driven-strategies-for-tariff-mitigation-in-business-operations/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;geopolitical risk and trade policy&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;volatility.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Regulatory Complexity:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The patchwork of global regulations is growing more tangled, demanding agile governance and compliance models.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consumer Expectations:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Today’s consumers want more—faster delivery, sustainable products, and transparency at every step.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Climate Disruption:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Extreme weather and environmental regulations are putting pressure on logistics and manufacturing alike.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology Evolution:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The pace of innovation is relentless, but so is the fragmentation between regions and sectors.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cybersecurity:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;As supply chains digitize, the risk of cyberattacks grows—especially for those without robust defenses.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Workforce and Skills:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The talent gap is widening as new technologies outpace workforce training and reskilling.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Social Equity:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Value chains must address not just efficiency, but fairness and inclusiveness across regions and communities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-751697156"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-555183651"&gt;Three Pillars for Future-Ready Value Chains&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, what does it take to build a value chain that can thrive amid all this change?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The WEF report highlights three strategic pillars:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integrated Sustainability:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sustainability&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;isn’t a side project—it’s a core business requirement. Companies are embedding environmental and social goals into every link of the value chain, from sourcing to delivery.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;End-to-End Collaboration:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Siloed operations are a thing of the past. The leaders of tomorrow are building deep partnerships and transparency with suppliers, customers, and even competitors to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;collaborate, share risks and innovate&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;together.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology Adoption:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Digital transformation is the backbone of resilience. Automation,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI&lt;/A&gt;, and real-time analytics are enabling companies to anticipate disruptions, optimize operations, and deliver on customer expectations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-358670146"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-162156641"&gt;What Does the Roadmap Look Like?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-94725855"&gt;2030: Action Today for Tomorrow’s Resilience&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The near-term focus is on tangible, actionable steps. The report highlights real-world use cases where companies are already making progress—whether it’s implementing circular economy models, building regional supply hubs, or using digital twins for scenario planning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The message is simple: start now and build a foundation for the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--177019019"&gt;2040: Scenario Planning for the Unknown&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking ahead to 2040, the WEF uses scenario planning to explore how these eight forces might interact. Will regulatory complexity spur innovation or stifle it? Will technology create new divides or bridge old ones? These scenarios aren’t predictions—they’re tools for stress-testing strategies and building agility into long-term plans.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--373532524"&gt;2050: A Vision for Sustainable, Equitable Value Chains&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 2050 outlook is a call to action. It challenges leaders to think beyond incremental improvement and envision a world where value chains are not only resilient and sustainable, but also inclusive and equitable. Achieving this vision will require bold decisions, cross-sector collaboration, and a willingness to rethink old assumptions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--276643022"&gt;Key Takeaways for Supply Chain Leaders&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resilience is Non-Negotiable:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The next disruption is always around the corner. Build flexibility and redundancy into your operations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sustainability Drives Competitiveness:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Regulatory and consumer pressures will only increase. Make sustainability a source of innovation and differentiation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Collaboration is the New Competitive Edge:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;No company can go it alone. Forge partnerships across your ecosystem.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Invest in People and Technology:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The future belongs to those who can harness technology and empower their workforce to adapt.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As someone who’s spent decades in supply chain and manufacturing, I see the WEF’s “&lt;A href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/from-shock-to-strategy-building-value-chains-for-the-next-30-years/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;From Shock to Strategy&lt;/A&gt;” report as both a wake-up call and a roadmap. The next 30 years will be defined by those who can turn uncertainty into opportunity. The time to act is now—because the supply chains we build today will shape the world of tomorrow.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This blog post will help readers, customers, and SAP TM users familiarize themselves with the SAP Transportation Management’s functionality to carry out execution of additional services and associated payments in S/4 HANA 2023.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post I will be shedding light on carrying out additional service payment by eliminating the need to create additional documents thus reducing process complexity. The process may vary on the business needs and situational in nature.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can read more about SAP S/4HANA Transportation Management -Settlement in the Application Help for SAP S/4HANA&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/e3dc5400c1cc41d1bc0ae0e7fd9aa5a2/4de4e09deeef447b8015f44d63971294.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Settlement | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Note: I have carried out the demonstration based on my personal tests, observations, insights in S/4HANA 2023 release with relevant screen shot from an internal system for ease of understanding. There’s no relevance or relation to any external source.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Use Case&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use case is for both the customers in Transportation &amp;amp; Logistics Industry (T&amp;amp;L) as well as shippers from Retail, CPG, manufactures etc. operating via Road and have to pay Additional fees for services incurred during or before executing the journey e.g. cleaning, fumigation or insurance etc over and above the contracted charges to an external party. The nature of the charge may be incidental in nature and not applicable for moves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Assumption:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The customer is a Manufacturing company and has implemented SAP S/4HANA 2023 and uses embedded SAP Transportation Management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;They have yearly contracts with the multiple road carriers to move certain capacities on a given corridor/ route. Alternatively, they have transportation network across different geographics which involves multiple entry and exists at the border crossing posts involving fees associated towards documentation/processing fees etc. As mentioned earlier this is applicable only if the truck crosses the border here by making it extremely important to track such services and associated charges. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The charges may vary depending on the border crossing location as each border crossing is managed by external parties. Contract in the SAP TM world should be referred as FRA (Freight Agreement).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Challenge:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2022 and lower releases supported such a scenario by creating an additional document termed as a service order which was linked to the associated freight order.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A service order as mentioned involves a cumbersome task to process it manually or an enhancement to automate the service order creation and associated settlement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Solution:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP TM now has an out of the box solution to enable charge calculation and settlement for a service incurred in a freight order depending on the location and time of the service. This eliminates the need to create an additional document i.e. the service order and also the stage alternation (Intermediate stop) in the freight order isn’t required to identify the border crossing location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;(*Depending on the scenarios, Service orders can be leveraged and its significance should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Note: There are multiple ways in which the additional agreement party can be determined be it via std partner determination profile config or via an available BADI, and purely based on the business rule.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Scenario:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A manufacturer is moving goods from its facility in Canada to a customer in US and can be routed via a border crossing across three different points i.e.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fort Erie&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Niagara Falls – Rainbow Bridge&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Niagara Falls – Whirlpool Rapids Bridge&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Border crossing across three different points - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose." style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282924i6DA6A776658FA13C/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="port.jpg" alt="Border crossing across three different points - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Border crossing across three different points - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Determining the shortest or most applicable route is not in the scope of this blog post. Every border crossing location is operated by an external party and charges vary depending on the location/Service provider. The manufacturer is entitled to pay an associated fee depending on multiple factors but here we will consider service provider and service location as the prime driver to identify payable amount.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s move directly at an instance in time where a road FRO is created with 1 active stages with executing carrier along with Border crossing agent as the Additional agreement party. The truck will cross the border via Fort Erie&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have valid Service types, Freight agreement i.e. 1 for executing carrier and 1 for Border crossing agent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We start with an assumption that Order management, planning, Charge management and settlement configs are in place as the focus is not on setting up the system but on functionality walk-through.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pictorial representation of the demonstrated scenario:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Fort Erie border crossing point - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose." style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282925i95DB344C06AE0B42/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Untitled.jpg" alt="Fort Erie border crossing point - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Fort Erie border crossing point - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basic process flow (Representation purpose only)&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Road FRO is created with executing carrier determined.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FO general screen.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282926i3425050AFF9B9220/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FO general screen.jpg" alt="FO general screen.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2 : &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Border crossing agent BP added as Additional agreement party.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="BP tab.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282927iD4C382280F6FF72A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="BP tab.jpg" alt="BP tab.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;As mentioned earlier there are multiple ways to determine a BP for Additional agreement party. For demonstration purpose I have added the BP manually and executing/invoicing carriers may be determined subcontracting process.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Once the carriers are determined, you can observe that a special service by the name ‘BC- Border crossing’ is assigned to the freight order.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282932i2AE77B5C0348F270/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture 2.jpg" alt="Picture 2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Important aspect to note here is that we have added 4 important values that play a pivotal role in triggering and performing charge calculation:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Service type&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Check box (Item specific service provider)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Service Location&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Duration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the absence on the Check box (Item specific service provider), system will assume the service is performed by the executing carrier and will have to be maintained as part of executing carrier’s freight agreement and will get activated based on the associated service. There by payable to the executing carrier. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the above information is captured, you may save the freight order or execute charge calculation manually from the freight order.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below is the result of the charge calculation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="charges screen shot.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282933iCC0A9B9C25FBABC1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="charges screen shot.jpg" alt="charges screen shot.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Note: Charge structure and associated charges are for representation purpose and are fictitious in nature. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Freight order stages – Important observation here to make a note is that the stage of the freight order is unaltered here by reducing efforts to trace the border crossing location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="stage screen.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282934i54CA40662CCEC1E4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="stage screen.jpg" alt="stage screen.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Determining charge based on the border crossing location at stage level is possible by leveraging std calculation base.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="charge tab 1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282935i049300D75FD39C0E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="charge tab 1.jpg" alt="charge tab 1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here you can observe that the charge is determined via a rate table.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rate table created having a calculation base as SRV_LOCATION which identifies the service location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Alternatively, you can use SRV_DURATION – Service Duration as well to perform charge calculation.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rate table 1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282937i593068C5AE47A712/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rate table 1.jpg" alt="rate table 1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rate table.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282936i75120CE0FDA06EB5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rate table.jpg" alt="rate table.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In today’s demonstration, I have considered only service location based calculation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The screenshot below demonstrates that system was able to initiate FSD creation for all of the applicable payable parties.&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FSD 1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282938iCFE49D277CC01FB8/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FSD 1.jpg" alt="FSD 1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FSD 2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282939i5F195CDE905597E0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FSD 2.jpg" alt="FSD 2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The screenshot above demonstrates that no errors were observed during freight settlement document creation process and we can proceed with posting for accruals. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Note:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;With the introduction of this functionality we can eliminate the introduction of service order which is an additional object and try to keep the process simple and reduce enhancement wherever applicable. Some exceptions may apply based on business scenarios and should be evaluated accordingly. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The demonstration in this blog post doesn’t focus on the configs to setup the system nor does it highlight all of the business rules associated with different industry sectors for the carrier payments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope this article helps all of us understand and simplify the payment process associated with additional services incurred during transportation across various industries in the SAP S/4HANA Transportation Management world. There may be multiple different ways in which a contract may be negotiated between two parties, in this demonstration, I chose to keep it generic and simple.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thank you for taking time and effort to read this.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Feedback/comments in any form will be highly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The ultimate destination in &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/04/5a01c68e-027f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.urc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model&lt;/A&gt; is Level 4: "&lt;STRONG&gt;Autonomous and Optimized&lt;/STRONG&gt;". This is where logistics operations are not just efficient, visible, and resilient, but truly orchestrated. Companies here leverage the full power of AI, automation, and predictive/prescriptive analytics, fueled by real-time internal and external data, including market conditions, weather, and traffic. Decisions on loads, routes, and carrier selection are continuously optimized with minimal manual oversight. Collaboration extends across the entire network, engaging partners in joint planning and execution. Visibility is comprehensive, tracking shipments across all modes, directly alongside business processes for order and fulfillment management, down to the SKU level, providing reliable ETAs informed by global risk monitoring.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Level 4 represents the highest state of logistics maturity, characterized by:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fully integrated, autonomous orchestration technology&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Predictive risk and shipment execution insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ecosystem collaboration and logistics visibility in the context of business operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While achieving Level 4 is aspirational, it serves as a critical &lt;STRONG&gt;objective&lt;/STRONG&gt; and a &lt;STRONG&gt;benchmark&lt;/STRONG&gt; for industry leaders. It represents the state where logistics drives clear competitive advantage by enabling exceptional resilience and customer satisfaction. For companies aspiring to this level, the model helps in measuring performance against the highest possible standards – looking at metrics like the percentage of automated transactions, time to resolve exceptions, on-time delivery rates, and the speed of onboarding new partners. It emphasizes continuous optimization, leveraging network-level data and collaboration for ongoing value creation. The improvement focus at this stage is on achieving true multi-tier supply chain automated &lt;STRONG&gt;Orchestration&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reaching this stage requires integrated technology and robust network connectivity. &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/supply-chain-logistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP supply chain logistics solutions&lt;/A&gt;, including &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/transportation-logistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Transportation Management&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/freight-collaboration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration&lt;/A&gt;, and &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/global-track-and-trace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace&lt;/A&gt;, are designed to provide the capabilities needed to improve at every level, from basic digital processes to advanced optimization and network collaboration. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regardless of where you are on the journey – just starting out at Level 1, gaining traction at Level 2, building momentum at Level 3, or striving for full orchestration at Level 4 – &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/04/5a01c68e-027f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.urc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model&lt;/A&gt; provides a tool for self-assessment along with a direction towards improvement.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Currently, Advanced ICo Stock Transfer functionality, delivered as part of SAP S/4HANA 2023 FSP2 Private Cloud/On Prem Edition, only supports a 2-Level business process. This business process comprises of exactly 2 legal units of a group, where in one legal unit, known as Receiving Company, purchases goods from second legal unit, known as Delivering Company.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following diagram depicts the above-mentioned as-is stock transfer business process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sumita_nagpal_0-1752408960516.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285843iCED97358BA6602F9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sumita_nagpal_0-1752408960516.png" alt="sumita_nagpal_0-1752408960516.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, certain companies/businesses require a 3-Level Intercompany Stock Transfer business process, which involves an intermediary legal unit, which sits in between the Receiving Company and the Delivering Company.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3-Level Structure and Business Flow&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;3-Level Intercompany Stock Transfer process comprises of 3 legal units of a group, where in one legal unit, known as Receiving Company, purchases goods from another legal unit, known as Delivering Company, via an intermediary legal unit, known as Intermediate Company.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From a business flow perspective, the Receiving Company purchases these goods from the Intermediate Company, which in turn purchases these goods from the Delivering Company.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Delivering Company delivers the goods directly to Receiving Company, i.e., the Intermediate Company does not receive the goods in a physical Plant.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This structure is used when legal, tax, or commercial reasons require the flow of ownership to pass through an intermediate legal entity, even though the goods are never routed through its warehouse or plant.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While creating the STO we provide the selling and delivering company whereas the intermediate company is identified using &lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Chains&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Chain Format&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Delivering Company/Plant → Intermediate Company/Transit Plant → Receiving Company/Plant&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How Financial Chains Are Determined&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the &lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Chains&lt;/STRONG&gt; are defined in the system, a separate &lt;STRONG&gt;determination setup&lt;/STRONG&gt; is created to decide which Financial Chain applies for a given transfer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This setup uses the following key criteria:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Process Type&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Material Number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Delivering Plant&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Receiving Plant&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Earliest Requested Delivery Date&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When a Stock Transport Order is created in the Selling Company, system checks the above combination and financial chain id is assigned for each item in the STO.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below diagram depicts the 3 level Stock transfer process:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sumita_nagpal_1-1752408960528.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285842i4FF63EFB0A2A2911/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sumita_nagpal_1-1752408960528.jpeg" alt="sumita_nagpal_1-1752408960528.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Activity diagram for the 3 level process is as below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sumita_nagpal_0-1752409989928.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285846i5C4115A68BACEBC0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sumita_nagpal_0-1752409989928.png" alt="sumita_nagpal_0-1752409989928.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Value Chain Flow&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The process comprises the following key steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Stock Transport Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Receiving Company (Initiating Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Purchase Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from Receiving Company to Intermediate Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Sales Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Intermediate Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Purchase Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from Intermediate Company to Delivering Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Sales Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Delivering Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Outbound Delivery&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Delivering Company (External/Manual Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Issue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for Outbound Delivery to SIT in Delivering Company’s Delivering Plant (External/Manual Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Issue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from Issuing SIT in Delivering Company (Plant) to Intermediate Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Receipt&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Intermediate Company’s Transit Plant (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Inbound Delivery&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Receiving Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Issue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from Intermediate Company’s Transit Plant SIT to Receiving Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Receipt&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Receiving Company’s Receiving Plant SIT (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Transfer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from SIT to Physical Stock in Receiving Company’s Receiving Plant (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Customer Invoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Delivering Company to Intermediate Company (External/Manual Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Supplier Invoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Intermediate Company from Delivering Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Customer Invoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Intermediate Company to Receiving Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Supplier Invoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Receiving Company from Intermediate Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits of 3-Level ICO Setup&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enables flexible supply chain structures&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Complies with tax/legal structures across countries&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Aligns with group-level financial control strategies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Optimizes logistics with direct delivery, while preserving legal flow&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 3-Level Advanced Intercompany Stock Transfer process extends beyond the standard 2-level scenario by introducing an intermediate legal entity for financial flows, while maintaining a direct delivery model for physical goods.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This 3-level stock transfer process is in line with the standard multi-level stock transfer process that is there in the future roadmap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical details will follow in upcoming blogs.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Which vendor is most likely to get it to me on time?"&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It sounds like a simple question—but when you actually dig into vendor KPIs, it’s hard to tell. One supplier has a high on-time percentage but a few big misses. Another always delivers—but with an unpredictable delay.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So I decided to build a little app to help with exactly this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1538646111"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":hammer_and_wrench:"&gt;🛠&lt;/span&gt;️ What I Built (and Why)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This prototype started as an experiment. I wanted to go &lt;STRONG&gt;beyond just on-time %&lt;/STRONG&gt; and bring &lt;STRONG&gt;probability&lt;/STRONG&gt; into the picture—because supply chain planning is messy, and we need smarter ways to assess vendor risk.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So I made a tool that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Takes your delivery data (CSV format) (With SAP AI- This can be automated)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Lets you &lt;STRONG&gt;filter by material, location, or recent months&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Plots &lt;STRONG&gt;PDF and PMF charts&lt;/STRONG&gt; (don’t worry—I’ll explain)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Calculates a quick, no-fuss &lt;STRONG&gt;vendor risk score&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;And the best part: it’s visual, interactive, and super easy to use.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s a quick peek at what you’ll see:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1342132606"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":blue_book:"&gt;📘&lt;/span&gt;Quick Refresher: PDF vs. PMF&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":magnifying_glass_tilted_left:"&gt;🔍&lt;/span&gt;Concept &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":chart_increasing:"&gt;📈&lt;/span&gt; What It Tells You &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":thinking_face:"&gt;🤔&lt;/span&gt; Example Question&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;PDF&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Probability Density Function)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;How delays are spread out&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;“What’s the chance of a delay between 2–5 days?”&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;PMF&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Probability Mass Function)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;How often a specific delay occurs&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;“How frequent is exactly 0 days of delay?”&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;By visualizing both, you get a &lt;STRONG&gt;complete picture&lt;/STRONG&gt;: not just averages, but volatility and certainty too.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1145619101"&gt;🧮 How I Score Vendor Risk&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To keep things practical, I used a simple formula:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Risk Score = Average Delay + 2 × (% Late Deliveries)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s not a PhD-level model—but it does the job.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1733369121"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;Q2 2025 has been an exciting quarter for SAP Business Network Asset Collaboration, bringing a rich set of innovations that simplify asset management, enhance data usability, and strengthen collaboration between asset operators, OEMs and service providers. This quarter focuses on advancing master data management, improving work order processes, and expanding integration and API capabilities to support seamless and standardized operations. Whether you're managing material data, processing equipment entry, or working with shared notifications and work orders, these updates are designed to help you work smarter, faster, and more collaboratively across your asset ecosystem.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1536855616"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1340342111"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Material Outbound Integration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Scope:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Support ERP outbound replication of materials to models between SAP ERP and SAP Business Network Asset Collaboration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Benefits:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-disc"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As an asset operator, you can replicate components assigned to work orders and work order operations from SAP ERP to SAP Business Network Asset Collaboration.
