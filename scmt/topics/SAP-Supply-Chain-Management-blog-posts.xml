    <content>&lt;P&gt;This blog post will help readers, customers, and SAP TM users familiarize themselves with the SAP Transportation Management’s functionality to carry out execution of additional services and associated payments in S/4 HANA 2023.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post I will be shedding light on carrying out additional service payment by eliminating the need to create additional documents thus reducing process complexity. The process may vary on the business needs and situational in nature.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can read more about SAP S/4HANA Transportation Management -Settlement in the Application Help for SAP S/4HANA&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/e3dc5400c1cc41d1bc0ae0e7fd9aa5a2/4de4e09deeef447b8015f44d63971294.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Settlement | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Note: I have carried out the demonstration based on my personal tests, observations, insights in S/4HANA 2023 release with relevant screen shot from an internal system for ease of understanding. There’s no relevance or relation to any external source.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Use Case&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use case is for both the customers in Transportation &amp;amp; Logistics Industry (T&amp;amp;L) as well as shippers from Retail, CPG, manufactures etc. operating via Road and have to pay Additional fees for services incurred during or before executing the journey e.g. cleaning, fumigation or insurance etc over and above the contracted charges to an external party. The nature of the charge may be incidental in nature and not applicable for moves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Assumption:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The customer is a Manufacturing company and has implemented SAP S/4HANA 2023 and uses embedded SAP Transportation Management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;They have yearly contracts with the multiple road carriers to move certain capacities on a given corridor/ route. Alternatively, they have transportation network across different geographics which involves multiple entry and exists at the border crossing posts involving fees associated towards documentation/processing fees etc. As mentioned earlier this is applicable only if the truck crosses the border here by making it extremely important to track such services and associated charges. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The charges may vary depending on the border crossing location as each border crossing is managed by external parties. Contract in the SAP TM world should be referred as FRA (Freight Agreement).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Challenge:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2022 and lower releases supported such a scenario by creating an additional document termed as a service order which was linked to the associated freight order.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A service order as mentioned involves a cumbersome task to process it manually or an enhancement to automate the service order creation and associated settlement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Solution:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP TM now has an out of the box solution to enable charge calculation and settlement for a service incurred in a freight order depending on the location and time of the service. This eliminates the need to create an additional document i.e. the service order and also the stage alternation (Intermediate stop) in the freight order isn’t required to identify the border crossing location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;(*Depending on the scenarios, Service orders can be leveraged and its significance should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Note: There are multiple ways in which the additional agreement party can be determined be it via std partner determination profile config or via an available BADI, and purely based on the business rule.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Scenario:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A manufacturer is moving goods from its facility in Canada to a customer in US and can be routed via a border crossing across three different points i.e.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fort Erie&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Niagara Falls – Rainbow Bridge&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Niagara Falls – Whirlpool Rapids Bridge&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Border crossing across three different points - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose." style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282924i6DA6A776658FA13C/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="port.jpg" alt="Border crossing across three different points - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Border crossing across three different points - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Determining the shortest or most applicable route is not in the scope of this blog post. Every border crossing location is operated by an external party and charges vary depending on the location/Service provider. The manufacturer is entitled to pay an associated fee depending on multiple factors but here we will consider service provider and service location as the prime driver to identify payable amount.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s move directly at an instance in time where a road FRO is created with 1 active stages with executing carrier along with Border crossing agent as the Additional agreement party. The truck will cross the border via Fort Erie&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have valid Service types, Freight agreement i.e. 1 for executing carrier and 1 for Border crossing agent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We start with an assumption that Order management, planning, Charge management and settlement configs are in place as the focus is not on setting up the system but on functionality walk-through.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pictorial representation of the demonstrated scenario:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Fort Erie border crossing point - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose." style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282925i95DB344C06AE0B42/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Untitled.jpg" alt="Fort Erie border crossing point - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Fort Erie border crossing point - Designed by Aditya Shinde only for representation purpose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Basic process flow (Representation purpose only)&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Road FRO is created with executing carrier determined.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FO general screen.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282926i3425050AFF9B9220/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FO general screen.jpg" alt="FO general screen.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2 : &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Border crossing agent BP added as Additional agreement party.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="BP tab.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282927iD4C382280F6FF72A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="BP tab.jpg" alt="BP tab.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;As mentioned earlier there are multiple ways to determine a BP for Additional agreement party. For demonstration purpose I have added the BP manually and executing/invoicing carriers may be determined subcontracting process.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Once the carriers are determined, you can observe that a special service by the name ‘BC- Border crossing’ is assigned to the freight order.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282932i2AE77B5C0348F270/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture 2.jpg" alt="Picture 2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Important aspect to note here is that we have added 4 important values that play a pivotal role in triggering and performing charge calculation:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Service type&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Check box (Item specific service provider)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Service Location&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Duration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the absence on the Check box (Item specific service provider), system will assume the service is performed by the executing carrier and will have to be maintained as part of executing carrier’s freight agreement and will get activated based on the associated service. There by payable to the executing carrier. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the above information is captured, you may save the freight order or execute charge calculation manually from the freight order.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below is the result of the charge calculation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="charges screen shot.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282933iCC0A9B9C25FBABC1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="charges screen shot.jpg" alt="charges screen shot.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Note: Charge structure and associated charges are for representation purpose and are fictitious in nature. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Freight order stages – Important observation here to make a note is that the stage of the freight order is unaltered here by reducing efforts to trace the border crossing location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="stage screen.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282934i54CA40662CCEC1E4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="stage screen.jpg" alt="stage screen.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Determining charge based on the border crossing location at stage level is possible by leveraging std calculation base.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="charge tab 1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282935i049300D75FD39C0E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="charge tab 1.jpg" alt="charge tab 1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here you can observe that the charge is determined via a rate table.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rate table created having a calculation base as SRV_LOCATION which identifies the service location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Alternatively, you can use SRV_DURATION – Service Duration as well to perform charge calculation.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rate table 1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282937i593068C5AE47A712/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rate table 1.jpg" alt="rate table 1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rate table.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282936i75120CE0FDA06EB5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rate table.jpg" alt="rate table.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In today’s demonstration, I have considered only service location based calculation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The screenshot below demonstrates that system was able to initiate FSD creation for all of the applicable payable parties.&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FSD 1.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282938iCFE49D277CC01FB8/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FSD 1.jpg" alt="FSD 1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FSD 2.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/282939i5F195CDE905597E0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="FSD 2.jpg" alt="FSD 2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The screenshot above demonstrates that no errors were observed during freight settlement document creation process and we can proceed with posting for accruals. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Note:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;With the introduction of this functionality we can eliminate the introduction of service order which is an additional object and try to keep the process simple and reduce enhancement wherever applicable. Some exceptions may apply based on business scenarios and should be evaluated accordingly. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The demonstration in this blog post doesn’t focus on the configs to setup the system nor does it highlight all of the business rules associated with different industry sectors for the carrier payments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope this article helps all of us understand and simplify the payment process associated with additional services incurred during transportation across various industries in the SAP S/4HANA Transportation Management world. There may be multiple different ways in which a contract may be negotiated between two parties, in this demonstration, I chose to keep it generic and simple.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Thank you for taking time and effort to read this.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Feedback/comments in any form will be highly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The ultimate destination in &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/04/5a01c68e-027f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.urc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model&lt;/A&gt; is Level 4: "&lt;STRONG&gt;Autonomous and Optimized&lt;/STRONG&gt;". This is where logistics operations are not just efficient, visible, and resilient, but truly orchestrated. Companies here leverage the full power of AI, automation, and predictive/prescriptive analytics, fueled by real-time internal and external data, including market conditions, weather, and traffic. Decisions on loads, routes, and carrier selection are continuously optimized with minimal manual oversight. Collaboration extends across the entire network, engaging partners in joint planning and execution. Visibility is comprehensive, tracking shipments across all modes, directly alongside business processes for order and fulfillment management, down to the SKU level, providing reliable ETAs informed by global risk monitoring.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Level 4 represents the highest state of logistics maturity, characterized by:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fully integrated, autonomous orchestration technology&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Predictive risk and shipment execution insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ecosystem collaboration and logistics visibility in the context of business operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While achieving Level 4 is aspirational, it serves as a critical &lt;STRONG&gt;objective&lt;/STRONG&gt; and a &lt;STRONG&gt;benchmark&lt;/STRONG&gt; for industry leaders. It represents the state where logistics drives clear competitive advantage by enabling exceptional resilience and customer satisfaction. For companies aspiring to this level, the model helps in measuring performance against the highest possible standards – looking at metrics like the percentage of automated transactions, time to resolve exceptions, on-time delivery rates, and the speed of onboarding new partners. It emphasizes continuous optimization, leveraging network-level data and collaboration for ongoing value creation. The improvement focus at this stage is on achieving true multi-tier supply chain automated &lt;STRONG&gt;Orchestration&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reaching this stage requires integrated technology and robust network connectivity. &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/supply-chain-logistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP supply chain logistics solutions&lt;/A&gt;, including &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/transportation-logistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Transportation Management&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/freight-collaboration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Network Freight Collaboration&lt;/A&gt;, and &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/global-track-and-trace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace&lt;/A&gt;, are designed to provide the capabilities needed to improve at every level, from basic digital processes to advanced optimization and network collaboration. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regardless of where you are on the journey – just starting out at Level 1, gaining traction at Level 2, building momentum at Level 3, or striving for full orchestration at Level 4 – &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/04/5a01c68e-027f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.urc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the Supply Chain Logistics Maturity Model&lt;/A&gt; provides a tool for self-assessment along with a direction towards improvement.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Currently, Advanced ICo Stock Transfer functionality, delivered as part of SAP S/4HANA 2023 FSP2 Private Cloud/On Prem Edition, only supports a 2-Level business process. This business process comprises of exactly 2 legal units of a group, where in one legal unit, known as Receiving Company, purchases goods from second legal unit, known as Delivering Company.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following diagram depicts the above-mentioned as-is stock transfer business process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sumita_nagpal_0-1752408960516.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285843iCED97358BA6602F9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sumita_nagpal_0-1752408960516.png" alt="sumita_nagpal_0-1752408960516.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, certain companies/businesses require a 3-Level Intercompany Stock Transfer business process, which involves an intermediary legal unit, which sits in between the Receiving Company and the Delivering Company.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3-Level Structure and Business Flow&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;3-Level Intercompany Stock Transfer process comprises of 3 legal units of a group, where in one legal unit, known as Receiving Company, purchases goods from another legal unit, known as Delivering Company, via an intermediary legal unit, known as Intermediate Company.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From a business flow perspective, the Receiving Company purchases these goods from the Intermediate Company, which in turn purchases these goods from the Delivering Company.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Delivering Company delivers the goods directly to Receiving Company, i.e., the Intermediate Company does not receive the goods in a physical Plant.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This structure is used when legal, tax, or commercial reasons require the flow of ownership to pass through an intermediate legal entity, even though the goods are never routed through its warehouse or plant.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While creating the STO we provide the selling and delivering company whereas the intermediate company is identified using &lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Chains&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Chain Format&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Delivering Company/Plant → Intermediate Company/Transit Plant → Receiving Company/Plant&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How Financial Chains Are Determined&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the &lt;STRONG&gt;Financial Chains&lt;/STRONG&gt; are defined in the system, a separate &lt;STRONG&gt;determination setup&lt;/STRONG&gt; is created to decide which Financial Chain applies for a given transfer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This setup uses the following key criteria:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Process Type&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Material Number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Delivering Plant&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Receiving Plant&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Earliest Requested Delivery Date&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When a Stock Transport Order is created in the Selling Company, system checks the above combination and financial chain id is assigned for each item in the STO.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below diagram depicts the 3 level Stock transfer process:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sumita_nagpal_1-1752408960528.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285842i4FF63EFB0A2A2911/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sumita_nagpal_1-1752408960528.jpeg" alt="sumita_nagpal_1-1752408960528.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Activity diagram for the 3 level process is as below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sumita_nagpal_0-1752409989928.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/285846i5C4115A68BACEBC0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sumita_nagpal_0-1752409989928.png" alt="sumita_nagpal_0-1752409989928.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Value Chain Flow&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The process comprises the following key steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Stock Transport Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Receiving Company (Initiating Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Purchase Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from Receiving Company to Intermediate Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Sales Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Intermediate Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Purchase Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from Intermediate Company to Delivering Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Sales Order&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Delivering Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Outbound Delivery&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Delivering Company (External/Manual Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Issue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for Outbound Delivery to SIT in Delivering Company’s Delivering Plant (External/Manual Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Issue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from Issuing SIT in Delivering Company (Plant) to Intermediate Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Receipt&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Intermediate Company’s Transit Plant (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Inbound Delivery&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Receiving Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Issue&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from Intermediate Company’s Transit Plant SIT to Receiving Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Receipt&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Receiving Company’s Receiving Plant SIT (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goods Transfer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from SIT to Physical Stock in Receiving Company’s Receiving Plant (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Customer Invoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Delivering Company to Intermediate Company (External/Manual Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Supplier Invoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Intermediate Company from Delivering Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Customer Invoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Intermediate Company to Receiving Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intercompany Supplier Invoice&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Receiving Company from Intermediate Company (Synchronous Step)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits of 3-Level ICO Setup&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enables flexible supply chain structures&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Complies with tax/legal structures across countries&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Aligns with group-level financial control strategies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Optimizes logistics with direct delivery, while preserving legal flow&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 3-Level Advanced Intercompany Stock Transfer process extends beyond the standard 2-level scenario by introducing an intermediate legal entity for financial flows, while maintaining a direct delivery model for physical goods.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This 3-level stock transfer process is in line with the standard multi-level stock transfer process that is there in the future roadmap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical details will follow in upcoming blogs.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Which vendor is most likely to get it to me on time?"&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It sounds like a simple question—but when you actually dig into vendor KPIs, it’s hard to tell. One supplier has a high on-time percentage but a few big misses. Another always delivers—but with an unpredictable delay.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So I decided to build a little app to help with exactly this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1538646111"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":hammer_and_wrench:"&gt;🛠&lt;/span&gt;️ What I Built (and Why)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This prototype started as an experiment. I wanted to go &lt;STRONG&gt;beyond just on-time %&lt;/STRONG&gt; and bring &lt;STRONG&gt;probability&lt;/STRONG&gt; into the picture—because supply chain planning is messy, and we need smarter ways to assess vendor risk.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So I made a tool that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Takes your delivery data (CSV format) (With SAP AI- This can be automated)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Lets you &lt;STRONG&gt;filter by material, location, or recent months&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Plots &lt;STRONG&gt;PDF and PMF charts&lt;/STRONG&gt; (don’t worry—I’ll explain)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Calculates a quick, no-fuss &lt;STRONG&gt;vendor risk score&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;And the best part: it’s visual, interactive, and super easy to use.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s a quick peek at what you’ll see:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1342132606"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":blue_book:"&gt;📘&lt;/span&gt;Quick Refresher: PDF vs. PMF&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":magnifying_glass_tilted_left:"&gt;🔍&lt;/span&gt;Concept &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":chart_increasing:"&gt;📈&lt;/span&gt; What It Tells You &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":thinking_face:"&gt;🤔&lt;/span&gt; Example Question&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;PDF&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Probability Density Function)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;How delays are spread out&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;“What’s the chance of a delay between 2–5 days?”&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;PMF&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Probability Mass Function)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;How often a specific delay occurs&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;“How frequent is exactly 0 days of delay?”&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;By visualizing both, you get a &lt;STRONG&gt;complete picture&lt;/STRONG&gt;: not just averages, but volatility and certainty too.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1145619101"&gt;🧮 How I Score Vendor Risk&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To keep things practical, I used a simple formula:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Risk Score = Average Delay + 2 × (% Late Deliveries)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s not a PhD-level model—but it does the job. Vendors with consistently late shipments or unpredictable spikes stand out quickly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-949105596"&gt;🧪 Built With&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Streamlit&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the UI (lightweight and fast)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Python&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Pandas&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the brainwork&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CSV input&lt;/STRONG&gt; so anyone can try it with real or dummy data&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-752592091"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":direct_hit:"&gt;🎯&lt;/span&gt;Try It Yourself&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Explore the POC at&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;A href="https://vendor-risk-analysis-7pevu6jdyyunwukxau8japp.streamlit.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;vendor-risk-analysis-7pevu6jdyyunwukxau8japp.streamlit.app&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Filter by material or region&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Zoom into any vendor&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Spot risky suppliers in seconds&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-556078586"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":robot_face:"&gt;🤖&lt;/span&gt;What If This Could Talk Back?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This got me thinking… What if I could &lt;STRONG&gt;ask&lt;/STRONG&gt; the app questions instead of reading graphs?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;“Which vendors in Europe have a high chance of 3+ day delays for Material-X in Q2?”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Or&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;“Show me suppliers with stable delivery patterns for critical parts.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where &lt;STRONG&gt;Generative AI APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt; come in. With a few tweaks, this app could:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use OpenAI or SAP GenAI Hub to parse natural-language queries&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;With SAP AI , you can port this Python code and&amp;nbsp; take it from POC to&amp;nbsp; Enterprise APP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Surface risk insights without you lifting a finger&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Even generate automatic weekly risk reports in plain English&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Narasimha_0-1752901526571.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288796i2F8F8F0D639EDA98/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Narasimha_0-1752901526571.png" alt="Narasimha_0-1752901526571.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Narasimha_1-1752901627964.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288797iC8B29FADBE522DC0/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Narasimha_1-1752901627964.png" alt="Narasimha_1-1752901627964.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-359565081"&gt;Related Work: MRP Exception Analyzer&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you liked this one, check out my earlier blog on an MRP Exception Analyzer I built using GenAI.&lt;BR /&gt;It turns SAP error codes into plain-language explanations:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/product-lifecycle-management-blog-posts-by-members/sap-ai-certified-amp-my-first-genai-prototype-mrp-exception-analyzer/ba-p/14151123" target="_blank"&gt;SAP AI Certified &amp;amp; My First GenAI Prototype: MRP Exception Analyzer&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

When configuring the Advanced Shipping &amp;amp; Receiving process, it is possible to specify the event that should be reported after the goods movement in the outbound processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This makes it possible to make your process more agile and cohesive, and to provide feedback to your freight order with all the necessary information, aiming to have a single point of reference for the process progress.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For this purpose, SAP provides the TM &lt;STRONG&gt;Save Strategy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;called &lt;STRONG&gt;PGI_REP_EV&lt;/STRONG&gt; shown in the print below, which must be configured in the freight orders relevant to the ASR process:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Coracini35_0-1753714042320.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292745i88EBD96E9019E130/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Coracini35_0-1753714042320.png" alt="Coracini35_0-1753714042320.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After the entire process is executed in the ASR, our freight order will have these events, where the next step is the execution of the PGI and then the departure from door, which are executed in the Load or Unload Freight Orders app. Without the above configuration, only during the "departure from door" step is an event reported, which in this case is &lt;STRONG&gt;"Departure From Door".&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Coracini35_1-1753714042327.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292747iE7EC4B863A5E4329/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Coracini35_1-1753714042327.png" alt="Coracini35_1-1753714042327.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This way we go to the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Load or unload Freight Orders"&lt;/STRONG&gt; App and perform the PGI:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Coracini35_2-1753714042333.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292746i35502C07BCB98C62/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Coracini35_2-1753714042333.png" alt="Coracini35_2-1753714042333.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Coracini35_3-1753714042334.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292748i2AF8C18F2BA8AD8E/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Coracini35_3-1753714042334.png" alt="Coracini35_3-1753714042334.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And this way, the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Checkout"&lt;/STRONG&gt; event is reported. Additionally, according to the ASR process itself, the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Departure From Door"&lt;/STRONG&gt; event is automatically reported. This occurs through the &lt;STRONG&gt;/scmtms/cl_tor_set_dep_wh_door-set_wh_door_departed&lt;/STRONG&gt; class/method, which performs a series of additional checks to report this additional event along with the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Checkout"&lt;/STRONG&gt; event. This way, we complete the entire process with just the PGI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Coracini35_4-1753714042341.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292750iBF149D21A36B2397/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Coracini35_4-1753714042341.png" alt="Coracini35_4-1753714042341.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, it will not be necessary to run this departure process on the monitor:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Coracini35_6-1753714042350.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292753i4F302E57B91725BA/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Coracini35_6-1753714042350.png" alt="Coracini35_6-1753714042350.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An important point is that it's possible to configure the event that will be reported for this strategy. As mentioned above, the reported event was &lt;STRONG&gt;"Checkout"&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This event was determined through a process controller parameter linked to the method and the standard strategy. However, the class is prepared to be configured with a custom strategy (&lt;STRONG&gt;ZPGI_REP_E&lt;/STRONG&gt;) and a custom parameter (&lt;STRONG&gt;ZEVENT_CODE&lt;/STRONG&gt;), so you can determine which event will be reported via configuration:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Coracini35_7-1753714042353.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292752i7338466D1F093402/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Coracini35_7-1753714042353.png" alt="Coracini35_7-1753714042353.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To do this:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create your own strategy according to the name described in the code and include the same method as the standard strategy&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create the parameter also with the custom name described&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And then assign the event code to the parameter and strategy in this last menu of the process controller configuration:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Coracini35_8-1753714042356.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292751i764094209D537357/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Coracini35_8-1753714042356.png" alt="Coracini35_8-1753714042356.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The manufacturing sector has always been at the forefront of innovation. From the steam engine to the assembly line, each leap has redefined what’s possible on the shop floor. Today, we stand at the threshold of another seismic shift—one powered not just by machines, but by intelligence itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The World Economic Forum’s latest whitepaper, “&lt;A href="https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Frontier_Technologies_in_Industrial_Operations_2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Frontier Technologies in Industrial Operations: The Rise of Artificial Intelligence Agents&lt;/A&gt;,” paints a compelling picture of this new era.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1736140798"&gt;Why Now? The Case for Frontier Technologies&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Industrial operations have long relied on innovations such as robotics and the industrial internet of things (IIoT) to drive productivity and efficiency. But the challenges facing manufacturers today are as complex as they are urgent.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2025/01/16/supply-chain-predictions-and-outlook-for-2025/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Labor shortages, rising costs, volatile supply chains, and the relentless push for sustainability are all converging&lt;/A&gt;. Manufacturers must not only optimize cost and efficiency but also adapt to rapid change, ensure resilience, and meet sustainability goals.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditional technologies, while powerful, are no longer enough to meet these demands. The answer lies in embracing what the WEF call “&lt;STRONG&gt;frontier technologies.&lt;/STRONG&gt;" Those that push the boundaries of what’s possible and unlock new forms of collaborative intelligence between humans and machines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But why the focus on AI agents, and why now? The answer is simple:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/resources/what-are-ai-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI agents&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;are not just another tool in the digital toolbox. They represent a new paradigm—one where software and robots can autonomously perceive, decide, and act, freeing up human workers to focus on creativity, strategy, and innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1539627293"&gt;The Rise of AI Agents: Virtual and Embodied&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Success requires a leap beyond incremental improvement—toward near-autonomous, AI-centric operations that empower people and machines to collaborate seamlessly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The whitepaper highlights two main types of AI agents driving this transformation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1472196507"&gt;1. Virtual AI Agents: The Digital Workforce&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Virtual AI agents operate within software environments. Think of them as digital colleagues—always on, always learning, and capable of making decisions in real time. These agents can act as assistants, advisers, or even fully autonomous controllers, handling everything from production scheduling to predictive maintenance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, a virtual AI agent might monitor a production line, identify bottlenecks, and automatically adjust workflows to optimize throughput.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;In supply chain management, these agents can analyze vast amounts of data, anticipate disruptions, and recommend alternative sourcing strategies&lt;/A&gt;—often before a human would even notice a problem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1275683002"&gt;2. Embodied AI Agents: The New Robotics&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Embodied AI agents take things a step further. These are robots equipped with advanced AI, capable of perceiving and interacting with the physical world. Unlike traditional robots, which are limited to repetitive, pre-programmed tasks, embodied AI agents can adapt to changing environments, handle complex assemblies, and even collaborate safely alongside human workers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Picture a robot that can not only pick and place components but also recognize when a part is defective, adjust its grip, or reroute itself to avoid an obstacle—no manual intervention required. This is the promise of embodied AI: robotics that are as flexible and intuitive as the people working beside them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-950086778"&gt;Redefining the Human Role&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most exciting—and perhaps misunderstood—aspects of this transformation is the role of people.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Karim Lakhani, a professor at Harvard Business School, when asked, “Will AI replace humans?”, famously replied, “Of course AI won’t replace humans. But humans with AI will replace humans without AI.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Far from replacing humans, AI agents are designed to augment human capabilities. As operations become more autonomous, the role of the worker evolves from hands-on operator to orchestrator and innovator.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-753573273"&gt;Strategic Imperatives: Building the Foundations&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Of course, realizing the full potential of AI agents requires more than just deploying new technology. Manufacturers must lay strong organizational and technological foundations:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governance and Change Management:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Leadership must champion the transformation, fostering a culture of innovation and trust.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Skills and Training:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Upskilling and reskilling are essential, with a focus on digital literacy, data analysis, and collaboration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data and Infrastructure:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;High-quality, accessible data is the lifeblood of AI. Robust connectivity, cybersecurity, and scalable computing power are non-negotiable.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ecosystem Collaboration:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;No company can do it alone. Partnerships across the value chain—suppliers, technology providers, academia—are key to accelerating innovation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-557059768"&gt;Looking Ahead: From Experimentation to Transformation&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The journey to AI-driven, near-autonomous operations is just beginning. Early adopters are already seeing tangible benefits, from reduced energy consumption to higher product quality and more resilient supply chains. But the real prize lies ahead: a future where manufacturers can respond to change with agility, drive sustainable growth, and empower their people like never before.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Frontier_Technologies_in_Industrial_Operations_2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;white paper&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;concludes, manufacturers who embrace frontier technologies today will be the leaders of tomorrow.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;If you find the error M7053 as shown in the image below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Luana_Lovison_0-1755091706610.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300392i34BA6E9F5435E206/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Luana_Lovison_0-1755091706610.png" alt="Luana_Lovison_0-1755091706610.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can try to follow the steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First of all, it’s important to mention that we tried to post goods in 08/2025, but my posting period ended in 06/2025. Therefore, we first need to check and close the period for 07/2025, and only then will we be able to verify the latest period — 08/2025.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Go to the app "Close Periods":&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Luana_Lovison_1-1755091918552.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300394i7B726E29197FD6A3/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Luana_Lovison_1-1755091918552.png" alt="Luana_Lovison_1-1755091918552.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Fill the company code, the period - with the month (e.g. 07/2025) following the last posting period (e.g 06/2025) - and fiscal&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;year boxe. Then select "Check and close periods":&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Luana_Lovison_2-1755091972508.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300395i7FECAA8D98DB5BD4/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Luana_Lovison_2-1755091972508.png" alt="Luana_Lovison_2-1755091972508.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you fill the period with the current month, like 08/2025 in this example, you are going to see the log below:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Luana_Lovison_3-1755092306728.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300396i05513FDEDD20CAD3/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Luana_Lovison_3-1755092306728.png" alt="Luana_Lovison_3-1755092306728.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. So, after you close the period for 07/2025, you can repeat the same steps for the current month. After that, you should be able to perform postings goods in the current period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Luana_Lovison_6-1755092718621.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300402iC7BCF78B85AA7C15/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Luana_Lovison_6-1755092718621.png" alt="Luana_Lovison_6-1755092718621.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This is a second blog in the series where I explore and update the latest in advanced supply planning in SAP IBP.&amp;nbsp; Here is a link to the first blog intro blog in this series. If you have not taken a look I highly encourage you to do so.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/unlock-the-potential-of-characteristics-based-planning-cbp-in-sap-ibp/ba-p/13786509" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/unlock-the-potential-of-characteristics-based-planning-cbp-in-sap-ibp/ba-p/13786509&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Blog 2 Intro: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Planners have long dreamed of an uninterrupted flow from proactive attribute-level planning to flawless execution. Now it’s here. The&amp;nbsp; latest &lt;STRONG&gt;Characteristics-Based Planning (CBP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; in IBP seamlessly orchestrates plans through &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA Segmentation&lt;/STRONG&gt; into &lt;STRONG&gt;Manufacturing Planning ePPDS (CDP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; — all out of the box — from strategic / tactical planning to detailed production scheduling and execution. All Natively integrated. No workarounds. No data loss.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;From Plan to Production – Attribute-Driven Orchestration Now Out of the Box&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Characteristics-Based Planning (CBP) in SAP IBP already empowers planners to manage supply and demand at a granular, attribute level including product and supply chain segments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We now take this to the next level: CBP plans in IBP can now flow seamlessly through S/4HANA demand supply Segmentation into detailed planning and scheduling in S4HANA Manufacturing planning (ePPDS) running with CDP (characteristics dependent planning) — natively, out of the box!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is not just integration — it’s &lt;STRONG&gt;end-to-end orchestration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Attributes like version, quality grade, or supply chain segment stay intact from tactical planning to shop floor execution, eliminating manual mapping, reducing errors, and ensuring planning intent is preserved in production. The result? Faster responses to demand changes, optimized sequencing, and execution without translation gaps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;here is an overview of the linked process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="PravinDeshmukh_0-1755118657538.png" style="width: 904px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300565i1C23B404BD3F6406/image-dimensions/904x474?v=v2" width="904" height="474" role="button" title="PravinDeshmukh_0-1755118657538.png" alt="PravinDeshmukh_0-1755118657538.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is CBP without boundaries — one seamless flow, one process, one truth, from plan to production. It’s the kind of end-to-end precision that changes how supply chains run.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;additional considerations for set up: please check out the following notes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#99CCFF"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;SAP Note&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3589243" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3589243 &lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;: &lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;CBP note for SYPP using Order-Integration 1/2&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#99CCFF"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;SAP Note&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3589243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3589243 &lt;/A&gt;:&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;CBP note for SYPP using Order-Integration 2/2 &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s Next&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;We’re exploring how to extend this orchestration to industries with more complex needs — Future scenarios could include shelf life–driven planning in conjunction with attribute-based component alignment for regulatory-compliant needs, all running seamlessly from IBP to execution.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;From the context of the migration of ECC to the S4 HANA, the relevance of query reduction may become more of a necessity rather than just a nice-to-have discipline. The reason pertains to the special nature of queries, as they are ‘generated code’ and not similar to regular custom code. As a whole, making ECC queries compatible with S4 may be a daunting task. Therefore, dedicated efforts will be needed to analyze the usage data of queries so that only the required ones migrate into S4 HANA and not the entire list of queries, as many of them are seldom used or may no longer be needed. The usage will provide quantitative information for IT and business to make an informed decision to determine the queries required for the S4 HANA system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, there is no straightforward way to calculate query usage statistics. In this write-up, we will attempt to arrive at a process to calculate the usage statistics of the SAP query.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Step 1: Create a List of Queries&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Run transaction SQ02: Click on ‘Go To’ à Select ‘Query Directory’ à and run wide open&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jaycc0127_8-1755210229687.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301214i2B244026A331EC5A/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jaycc0127_8-1755210229687.png" alt="jaycc0127_8-1755210229687.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Step 2: Extract raw data for query usage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Run transaction SCMON and select ‘Display data.’&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jaycc0127_1-1755210114071.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301202i8D755B6F28C9249E/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jaycc0127_1-1755210114071.png" alt="jaycc0127_1-1755210114071.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This write-up assumed that there are three ways SAP Query can be called:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Direct query call using SQ01&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Query running in Batch jobs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Query called through custom transactions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Usage Data Collection&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Get usage data for direct call using SQ01&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;from SCMON&lt;/STRONG&gt; using ‘Calling Request Entry Point’ as Type = ‘T’ and Name = ‘SQ01’ (see below)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jaycc0127_9-1755210360150.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301215i64447017A1F6456F/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jaycc0127_9-1755210360150.png" alt="jaycc0127_9-1755210360150.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jaycc0127_2-1755210114072.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301201i5C4955DFDD84F8AA/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jaycc0127_2-1755210114072.png" alt="jaycc0127_2-1755210114072.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Next screen&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jaycc0127_10-1755210395309.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301216i5AA9AB2D6A01315B/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jaycc0127_10-1755210395309.png" alt="jaycc0127_10-1755210395309.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Key steps to be followed:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Downloaded the list for ‘Submitted Report’ (or DELETE other Request type rows from downloaded report so that we ONLY get ‘Submitted Report’ in resultant Excel)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Concatenate User Group &amp;amp; Query name in a NEW column before Num of Calls column (for easier VLOOKUP later)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Get usage data for batch call using jobs from SCMON&lt;/STRONG&gt; using ‘Calling Request Entry Point’ as Type = ‘B’ and Name = ‘AQIC*’ (see below)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jaycc0127_11-1755210422077.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301217i43B45933E32B064C/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jaycc0127_11-1755210422077.png" alt="jaycc0127_11-1755210422077.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the next screen, filter only Procurement Type as ‘SSEL’ (as we only want to know the&amp;nbsp;start of selection)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Get usage data for custom transaction call from SCMON&lt;/STRONG&gt; using ‘Calling Request Entry Point’ as Type = ‘T’ and Name = ‘all custom tcode’ that calls a SAP query at execution. (see below)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jaycc0127_6-1755210114074.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301206i660D86B9EF5E98DD/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jaycc0127_6-1755210114074.png" alt="jaycc0127_6-1755210114074.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the output, filter only records with ‘Proc Type’ as SSEL.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once we extract raw data, the remaining portion of the work pertains to connecting data from different files and deriving intelligence on collective usage/calls of respective queries (hint: use Mid &amp;amp; VLOOKUP functions in Excel).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ultimately, sum up all usages to get the final usage (sample output)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jaycc0127_12-1755210519556.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301218iC169494AFC6AB904/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jaycc0127_12-1755210519556.png" alt="jaycc0127_12-1755210519556.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This write has considered one of the possible approaches to simplistically arrive at the usage data for SAP queries, several which tend to grow significantly with the complexity of business processes and user requirements. For system migration, specifically in the context of S4 HANA conversion from ECC, reduction of redundant queries can pay substantial dividend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In today’s global economy, supply chains are under greater pressure than ever before. Shifting trade regulations, evolving geopolitical landscapes, labor shortages, and rising customer expectations are driving unprecedented complexity. Many organizations are realizing that traditional, siloed approaches to supply chain management are no longer enough to remain competitive—or to simply keep pace with disruption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The stakes are high: one weak link can set off ripple effects across operations, manufacturing, logistics, and customer delivery. For businesses that rely on complex supplier networks and face unpredictable market dynamics, resilience can’t be an afterthought, it must be designed into the supply chain itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That’s where&amp;nbsp;supply chain orchestration&amp;nbsp;comes in. Rather than focusing on isolated improvements within functional areas, orchestration integrates processes, data, and decision-making across the entire value chain. With the right strategy, companies can transform supply chains from reactive networks into connected ecosystems that anticipate shifts, adapt rapidly to disruptions, and deliver on customer promises.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To help you explore how orchestration creates more effective and future-ready supply chains,&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&amp;amp;eventid=5020561&amp;amp;sessionid=1&amp;amp;key=57E9F6DDDA69192982DCB4CDB97E69A5&amp;amp;groupId=6247340&amp;amp;partnerref=blog&amp;amp;sourcepage=register" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP, HP, and Accenture&amp;nbsp;are hosting a&amp;nbsp; webinar&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;designed for supply chain and operations leaders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The session will showcase the opportunities orchestration brings to organizations across industries, and offer practical ways to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improve agility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and mitigate disruption with aligned, end-to-end processes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhance visibility and execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;for faster, smarter, AI-supported decisions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Strengthen coordination&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;with suppliers and partners while building a foundation for scalable, proactive operations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Join my guests:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antoine Colin, &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Senior VP, Supply Chain Transformation and Resilience, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;HP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sid Gudal, &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Managing Director, Partner, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accenture&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sudy Bharadwaj, &lt;/STRONG&gt;Global VP, Strategic Engagements, Intelligent Spend and Business Networks SAP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&amp;amp;eventid=5020561&amp;amp;sessionid=1&amp;amp;key=57E9F6DDDA69192982DCB4CDB97E69A5&amp;amp;groupId=6247340&amp;amp;partnerref=blog&amp;amp;sourcepage=register" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Driving Resilience Through Intelligent Supply Chain Orchestration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tuesday, September 02, 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Many Industries consider the manufacturing location as a plant in SAP. Under the plant, many storage locations would be available in SAP and some of them would be either IM managed (or Lean Warehouse managed), or Stock Room Managed (StRM) or EWM managed. As a part of the distribution process from the manufacturing site, there would be every chance that the different products from all these types of warehouses need to be shipped to other DC site or to the customer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog covers my personal insights about the outbound process in SAP from MFG (manufacturing) site to other DC (distribution center) or to the customer wherein the different products are picked up from Lean Warehouse, StRM and EWM managed warehouse locations and loaded onto the the same vehicle under the single Freight Order (FO) with the help of SAP EWM and SAP TM ASR integration in basic S/4 HANA licence or in advanced S/4 HANA license using S/4 HANA 2023 FPS02 version.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Process FLow -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Process Flow - MFG Site (that has LE, StRM and EWM warehouse) to another DC / Customer in single Freight Order" style="width: 702px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304294iCD59E5DE800CA1A0/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picking from Different Warehouses - ASR.png" alt="Process Flow - MFG Site (that has LE, StRM and EWM warehouse) to another DC / Customer in single Freight Order" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Process Flow - MFG Site (that has LE, StRM and EWM warehouse) to another DC / Customer in single Freight Order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Master Data -&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Maintain Loading Point location for EWM specific warehouse - transaction code # /SCMTMS/LOC3 -&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Loading Point - EWM Warehouse" style="width: 475px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304275iA2CB5AA1481D6606/image-dimensions/475x196/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="475" height="196" role="button" title="LP location-EWM warehouse.png" alt="Loading Point - EWM Warehouse" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Loading Point - EWM Warehouse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;For any MRO organization (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations), kitting and staging is a core warehouse activity. On the surface, it seems simple. But in reality, it's a web of complexity, often managed by years of accumulated custom code and custom business process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1960883375"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introducing Standard Kitting &amp;amp; Staging in S/4HANA 2023&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;With the release of&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA 2023 FPS02&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the struggle with custom kitting solutions is over. SAP has delivered a standard, industry-focused solution designed specifically for the intricacies of MRO:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;End-to-End Kitting &amp;amp; Staging with SAP Field Logistics.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This solution was co-designed with customers to address the real-world challenges you face every day. It’s built on six core principles to deliver a unified, streamlined process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Centralize Kitting for Remote Operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Efficiently to build, stage, and dispatch kits from a central warehouse directly to remote or field locations, ensuring the right parts are in the right place at the right time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Handle All Types of Goods Seamlessly&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Support not only inventory managed materials, but also non inventory stock, rental equipment and supplier provided items as part of services, ensuring full visibility and control across all goods movements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Empower Your Field Locations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Don’t just ship parts—ship capability. Remote sites can now receive kits, manage kits, add locally held components, and issue the completed kit directly to a maintenance order.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Simplify and Standardize Your Processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Whether you operate a single, streamlined plant or manage a complex network of remote locations supported by a supply base, this solution provides a standard, repeatable process to eliminate guesswork and create one version of the truth for your kitting and staging operations.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Gain End-to-End Visibility in a Single Place&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Stop chasing information across different systems. The entire kitting lifecycle—from creation and staging to dispatch and final issuance—is tracked in a single, accessible repository, giving you unprecedented control and insight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Scale for Your Environment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This isn't a rigid, one-size-fits-all tool. The solution is designed to scale and adapt, supporting various warehouse management setups including Inventory Management (IM), Extended Warehouse Management (EWM), and even hybrid combinations depending on your organisation.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1764369870"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Future-Proof Foundation for Your MRO Warehouse&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;By embedding this critical MRO process directly into the S/4HANA core, SAP has delivered a solution that is robust, scalable, and future proof. You can finally retire that aging custom code, move forward with confidence using a standard SAP solution at the base.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This is more than just a new feature; it's a new foundation for operational excellence in your MRO supply chain.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_1-1755517944567.png" style="width: 936px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301947i655D233314DDE929/image-dimensions/936x520?v=v2" width="936" height="520" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_1-1755517944567.png" alt="simon_thomson99_1-1755517944567.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1438773646"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;From Order to Staged Kit: A Look at the New Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;So, how does it actually work? The entire process is designed to be intuitive and integrated with maintenance and project business process.&amp;nbsp; And it all begins exactly where it should: with the demand from the field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1: The Kit is Born from the Demand Signal&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;It all starts with a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Work Order&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;or&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Network Order;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;the kit is automatically created and updated. As the requested materials arrive at the &lt;STRONG&gt;Supply Base&lt;/STRONG&gt;, using the Field Logistics Cross-Docking process, the system automatically triggers the tracking milestones and begins the process of bringing everything together.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;What truly sets this solution apart is its flexibility in defining the kit. You are no longer locked into a single method like in the past. At the demand plant level, you can define a kit based:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Work Order/Network Order Header:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Perfect for bundling all materials where work is planned and scheduled at the header.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Work Order/Network Order Operation:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Ideal for creating kits for specific phases or tasks within a more detailed &lt;/FONT&gt;planning and scheduling environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A flexible definition via BAdI:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;For unique business requirements, this allows you to implement custom logic while remaining within the standard framework.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2: Augment the Kit with Local Inventory&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The process doesn't stop with the initial cross dock. If required, you can easily supplement the base kit by adding stock directly from local base inventory or as more cross docking occurs. This hybrid approach allows you to combine centrally sourced materials with locally available parts for maximum efficiency, speed and tracking.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3: Pack, Stage, and Track with Precision&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Once complete, the kit can be packed into standard Field Logistics objects like&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Containers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;or &lt;STRONG&gt;Packages&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;Crucially, every object—including the delivery items —can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin via a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard field &lt;/STRONG&gt;via the&lt;STRONG&gt; Pack Containers &lt;/STRONG&gt;(&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F5786')/S30PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F5786&lt;/A&gt;)app. This eliminates guesswork and "lost" kits. The result is pinpoint accuracy on the warehouse floor, where everyone knows exactly what a kit contains, where it is, and which job it’s for.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_5-1755523335642.png" style="width: 935px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301986i6D29E1BC05A41826/image-dimensions/935x520?v=v2" width="935" height="520" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_5-1755523335642.png" alt="simon_thomson99_5-1755523335642.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1242260141"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Flexibility at the Edge: Managing Kits Upon Arrival&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;The journey doesn't end when the kit leaves the central warehouse. A core strength of SAP Field Logistics is its ability to track the Supply Chain end to end. The solution is designed to handle several common scenarios:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1174829355"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario 1: The "Base Kit" Handover&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;In this model, all components have been kitted at the central base. The kit arrives at the remote location fully prepared. The process here is built for speed and simplicity:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Receive:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The remote site performs a simple goods receipt for the complete kit.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stage:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The kit is stored, ready for the job.&amp;nbsp; The kit can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin via a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard field.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-978315850"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario 2: The "Remote Kit" Assembly&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This scenario is common in industries like Mining or Land-Based Operations where remote sites are highly self-sufficient. Here, no physical goods are shipped from the base. Instead:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Demand Signal:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The demand is to be supplied fully from the remote site.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Local Assembly:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The kit is assembled and managed&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;entirely&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;at the remote location using its locally held inventory. This empowers the remote team to take full ownership of the kitting process and support the operations stocking strategy.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stage:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The kit is stored, ready for the job.&amp;nbsp; The kit can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin via a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard field.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-781802345"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scenario 3: The "Re-Kit" Hybrid Model&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This flexible, hybrid approach offers the best of both worlds. A base kit containing centrally sourced or specialized parts is shipped from the main warehouse. Upon arrival:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Receive Base Kit:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The initial kit is received at the remote location.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Augment Locally:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The remote team then adds further components to the kit directly from their local inventory to create the final package.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stage:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The kit is stored, ready for the job.&amp;nbsp; The kit can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin via a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard field.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This adaptability—from a simple handover to full remote assembly—ensures that no matter your operational model, the system supports your reality on the ground.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_6-1755525355616.png" style="width: 936px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301994iADB91607C7B6A538/image-dimensions/936x530?v=v2" width="936" height="530" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_6-1755525355616.png" alt="simon_thomson99_6-1755525355616.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-456206121"&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mastering "The Last Mile": Detailed Tracking at the Remote Site&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;The final journey of a kit—from the remote warehouse shelf to the hands of a technician—is often a logistical black box. This critical phase, aptly named&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;"The Last Mile,"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;is where parts get misplaced, jobs get delayed, and efficiency breaks down. A common problem is the lack of real-time visibility once a kit is "in the system" but not yet in use.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;SAP Field Logistics solves this by introducing key tracking milestones for the entire "Last Mile" lifecycle. Now, users can pinpoint exactly where everything is in real-time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Stage -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;Once a kit item is received or assembled at the remote location, its status is set to&amp;nbsp;Staged. It is officially logged as staged and ready for the job. The kit can be assigned to a specific staging location or bin using a dedicated standard field. The warehouse knows exactly what is ready and precisely where to find it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Drop -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;As the job start time approaches, the kit needs to move closer to the point of work. When this happens, its status is updated to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dropped&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It can then be assigned to a nominated drop point—like a specific laydown yard or workshop area—again using a &lt;STRONG&gt;dedicated standard location field&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Issue -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This is the final, crucial handover. The kits items status is updated to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Issued&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;at the moment the technician formally receives the complete kit. This closes the loop on the logistics process, providing a clear and simple audit trail. It confirms that the right parts were delivered to the right person at the right time, minimizing disputes and ensuring the job can begin without delay.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_4-1755518069378.png" style="width: 936px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301950i773F64581600DAA2/image-dimensions/936x504?v=v2" width="936" height="504" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_4-1755518069378.png" alt="simon_thomson99_4-1755518069378.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-259692616"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Unlocking Total Visibility: Answering "Where Is My Stuff?"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;In any MRO operation, the question "Where is my stuff?" is asked daily. But "stuff" can mean anything—an individual component, a complex kit for a shutdown, or all the materials for a week's worth of routine maintenance. Answering this question accurately and in real-time has always been a major challenge.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;SAP Field Logistics answers this question by tracking every item against extensive, standard milestones, it provides a single source of truth. This critical information is no longer buried in spreadsheets or system tables; it is visualized in intuitive Fiori applications and via exposed API's.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;While day-to-day operations are handled in the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Kits &lt;/STRONG&gt;(&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F8005')/S30PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F8005&lt;/A&gt;)&amp;nbsp;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Logistics &lt;/STRONG&gt;(&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F5082')/S30PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F5082&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;) apps, the consolidated view of this new visibility comes to life in the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Logistics Tracking &lt;/STRONG&gt;(&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F7382')/S30PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;F7382&lt;/A&gt;) app.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;First delivered with S/4HANA 2023 FPS00, the Logistics Tracking App has now been specifically enhanced to include the key kitting milestones. This means the "Last Mile" statuses—&lt;STRONG&gt;Stage, Drop, and Issue&lt;/STRONG&gt;—are now surfaced directly in this central dashboard.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;The result is a single view where planners, supervisors, and technicians can see the real-time status of any component or kit, from the central warehouse all the way to the point of use. The question is no longer "Where is my stuff?" but "What do I need to look at next?"&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="simon_thomson99_7-1755525467499.png" style="width: 940px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301995i238FDB14748A46B3/image-dimensions/940x506?v=v2" width="940" height="506" role="button" title="simon_thomson99_7-1755525467499.png" alt="simon_thomson99_7-1755525467499.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-63179111"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Five Core Capabilities That Transform MRO Logistics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;Having walked through the end-to-end process, from the central warehouse to the final handover, we can see how SAP Field Logistics delivers a set of transformative capabilities that directly address the core challenges of MRO supply chains.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. A Single, Standardized Process from Warehouse to Worksite&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;For the first time, a single, standard process governs the entire kitting lifecycle. From the initial build in a supply base to augmenting a kit at a remote site and issuing it to a technician, the system provides one unified framework. This eliminates process variations, reduces training overhead, and establishes a foundation for operational excellence across the entire organization.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Real-Time, End-to-End Visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;The question "Where is my stuff?" is definitively answered. Through the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Logistics Tracking App&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and dedicated Fiori dashboards, you have a single source of truth. By tracking key milestones like&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Staged, Dropped, and Issued&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you gain complete, real-time visibility into the "Last Mile," enabling better decision-making and proactive control.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Flexibility for Real-World Operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;This is not a rigid, one-size-fits-all solution. It is built to adapt to your reality. Whether you need to define a kit by an entire work order or a specific operation, or whether you manage kits centrally, remotely, or through a hybrid model, the solution provides the flexibility to support your specific business needs.&amp;nbsp; For example - your operation does not drop but issues directly from staging, this is supported.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Integration with Core Maintenance and Warehouse Processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SAP Field Logistics is not a standalone module; it is woven into the digital core. It integrates seamlessly with Maintenance Orders, Network Orders, Logistics Execution (LE), Inventory Management (IM), and Extended Warehouse Management (EWM). This ensures data consistency, prevents information silos, and creates a smooth, automated flow from maintenance planning to field execution.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Finally Retire Custom Code and Embrace a Clean Core&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Perhaps the most strategic benefit is the ability to finally retire your expensive, high-risk custom kitting solutions. By moving this critical functionality into the S/4HANA standard, you can eliminate technical debt, simplify future upgrades, and fully embrace a "clean core" strategy. This reduces your total cost of ownership and positions your organization on a future-proof platform for years to come.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--208565763"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion: The Future is Standard&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;For years, managing MRO kitting has meant a compromise. Organizations were forced to choose between a standard SAP process that didn't fully meet their needs or investing heavily in complex, custom-coded solutions that created technical debt and upgrade risk. These "Z-solutions," while functional, were brittle, expensive to maintain, and operated in a silo with each customer to define everything including integration.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;With the introduction of SAP Field Logistics in S/4HANA, that era is over.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;The journey from a fragmented, high-maintenance custom process to a powerful, flexible, and standard solution is no longer a future ambition—it is a present reality. We have seen how Field Logistics provides a single, unified framework to:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Define and build&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;kits with flexibility.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;them across diverse remote site scenarios.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Track&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;them through "The Last Mile."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Visualize&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;their status in real-time for all stakeholders.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="helvetica" size="3"&gt;This is more than a new module; it is a fundamental shift in strategy.

With this release of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, supply chain management takes another step forward in agility, intelligence, and integration. This update introduces a range of enhancements designed to optimize end-to-end processes, improve real-time visibility, and support faster decision-making across logistics and operations. Whether you're focused on inventory, transport, production, or delivery, the 2508 release brings innovative features that align with today's demand for resilient and sustainable supply chains. Check out the release video below for the quick summary of selected features, or read on below for more detail and some comprehensive E2E demos!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_iyqmwa45" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1760035046"&gt;Core Logistics Topics&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We'll kick things off with the latest core logistics features release in 2508, designed to enhance your fundamental supply chain execution and planning processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1692604260"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Inventory Management&lt;BR /&gt;Support for Copied Movement Types in SAP Fiori Apps for Goods movement&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Flexibility to adapt business processes is a vital aspect of a dynamic supply chain, and custom movement types in SAP S/4HANA Cloud offer just that. These custom adaptations of standard movement types serve to bridge gaps where predefined scenarios may not meet particular business needs, allowing tailor-made solutions for unique business requirements. The SAP FIORI apps which support custom movement types have been extended to include Manage stock (F1062), Transfer Stock – In Plant (F1061) and Transfer Stock – Cross Plan (F1957).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;One prominent use case for custom movement types arises when there’s a need to post goods movements to different General Ledger (GL) account determinations. While standard movement types seamlessly integrate with key SAP FIORI apps for goods movement, setting up a custom movement type involves a simple two-step process: first, copy an existing standard movement type in your configuration environment, assigning it a new character key starting with 9, x, y, or z, while adding any additional necessary details. The next step is to implement the custom Business Add-In (BAdI) MMIM_GR4XY_PROVIDE_DATA. This facilitates the availability of this newly created movement type alongside standard options in the supported FIORI apps, allowing users the flexibility to select the movement type that best fits their operational needs. This approach not only maximizes the system’s adaptability but also ensures streamlined and efficient management of specialized business processes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;For a step-by-step description of the implementing this process, check out this &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/custom-movement-types-in-inventory-management-fiori-apps-part-1/ba-p/13982556" target="_blank"&gt;blog post.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_0-1757599353160.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313151iA5CAD9A81235571C/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_0-1757599353160.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_0-1757599353160.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(fig: Custom movement types displayed in Transfer Stock – In Plant)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New FIORI App - Manage Physical Inventory Document Items&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Inventory Management, a key theme of the 2508 release is the strategic modernization of the user experience to boost performance and analytical capabilities. With the 2508 release, we introduce the new app “Manage Physical Inventory document Items” (F8634) as a successor to transaction MI20 “Process physical inventory count results”, which has been deprecated. The &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/ee9ee0ca4c3942068ea584d2f929b5b1/3e8bbaec0b544b52bc4d1c9db2b1d1db.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=2508.00" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;experience switch&lt;/A&gt; is enabled on both apps, enabling users with the correct authorizations to switch between them with ease. The new app provides a clearer overview of physical inventory tasks, directly in the list view saving users time. The new app’s functionality doesn’t stop there; it empowers you to fine-tune your workflow through customization options. For instance, adding fields such as storage bin information can streamline precise material location management. Moreover, with enhanced filtering capabilities, you can now delve deeper into your data, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of inventory differences. With these improvements, transitioning to the Manage Physical Inventory Item List (F8634) app not only future-proofs your inventory operations but also enriches the way you interact with your inventory data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_3-1757599714697.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313158iCF9336EECD4293AD/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_3-1757599714697.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_3-1757599714697.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Support for Barcode Scanning for Additional Goods Issues (Project / Asset)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A further new feature in inventory management – the "Manage Stock" app has been enhanced with barcode scanning for goods movements for both project stock and assets. New movement types for this stock have been introduced to streamline and optimize your inventory management processes. Efficiency gains come with the capability to leverage composite barcode scanning within the app. Users can select the new stock change options for goods issue projects or assets in the manage stock app, then assign the related WBS element or asset or sub-asset number respectively. This enhancement translates to faster and more efficient processing of inventory adjustments, reducing not just the margin for error but also the time spent managing inventory tasks. Overall, these updates are set to greatly enhance stock management workflows, making them not only more efficient but also more aligned with contemporary business needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_4-1757599759537.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313159iB2A2BBBA14E9AD2D/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_4-1757599759537.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_4-1757599759537.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cross-Plant Transfer Posting with Item Lines&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Item lists are a collection of material items that you can process together in warehouse or inventory processes. Whilst this is a familiar feature, with 2508 we have expanded where item lists are deployed to enhance inventory processes and introduce them to the “Transfer Stock – Cross Plan” application. Here, it is now possible to create a list of multiple items for stock transfer, enabling users to post items in one step and on one material document. This provides greater visibility as you see all transferred items in one list across plants and improves efficiency when checking movement history for several materials on one list.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_5-1757599806002.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313160iAF052A3FDB8AD156/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_5-1757599806002.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_5-1757599806002.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extensibility Updates&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Enhancing process flexibility, this release introduces new extensibility options for material reservation applications. Businesses can now add custom fields to the user interfaces and underlying business logic for creating, changing, and displaying reservations. This allows companies to capture and process specific information relevant to their unique operational needs directly within the reservation document. For example, a business could add a field to track a project code or a specific reason for the reservation, improving data richness, enhancing reporting, and ensuring that custom process requirements are met without complex workarounds.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1496090755"&gt;Handling Unit Management&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key to managing packaging, tracking and handling goods throughout your supply chain, we also have some updates to Handling Unit Management functionality. With this release, we introduce two key enhancements to Handling Units APIs.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Assign Serial Numbers to Existing Handling Units&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A key innovation in this release is the enhancement of the Handling Unit (HU) OData API, which now supports the assignment of serial numbers to already created handling units—a critical capability that was previously missing. This enhancement addresses a functional gap left by previous API operations that only supported packing and posting goods receipt for production orders. Now, before a goods receipt is posted, serial numbers can be assigned to HUs via the API, streamlining processes where HUs are prepared in advance. This capability ensures better alignment with manufacturing and warehouse workflows where serialization is required before physical goods receipt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The updated API enables serial number assignment through two supported scenarios: either by generating serial numbers automatically at production order creation (based on the serial number profile), or by receiving them from an external system via API communication. The API intelligently checks whether a production order already includes serial numbers and defaults to these when assigning to HUs, ensuring data consistency. This innovation not only supports developer extensibility and integration flexibility but also significantly enhances traceability and compliance in serialized environments—especially in regulated industries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_6-1757599940503.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313162i8A96524D87E70FF3/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_6-1757599940503.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_6-1757599940503.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced Security for Production Supply Area Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To strengthen integration security, the Production Supply Area (PSA) OData API now supports OAuth 2.0 authentication, aligning with modern SAP security protocols and standards. This enhancement ensures a more secure, token-based authorization process, enabling third-party applications to access SAP S/4HANA Cloud resources without exposing sensitive credentials in the payload. OAuth 2.0 improves trust and compliance for integrations, especially in multi-system landscapes where security and granular access control are critical.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This update also improves connectivity with SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), making it easier to securely link external applications to SAP S/4HANA Cloud for PSA-related data access. Applications can now request specific scopes of access to user data, supporting role-based security and limiting unnecessary data exposure. With this change, customers gain more controlled, secure, and scalable integration patterns for managing production supply data across platforms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_7-1757599977089.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313163iE3519F2B6E475E02/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_7-1757599977089.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_7-1757599977089.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Delivery Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;RAP events are standardized notifications that signal changes in business objects, enabling flexible and loosely coupled extensions in SAP S/4HANA Cloud.&amp;nbsp;With the latest innovation, RAP events are now available for outbound delivery, inbound delivery, and customer returns delivery, empowering developers working with embedded extensibility (Developer Extensibility) to enhance their projects directly on-stack. You can implement custom logic to consume events such as Created, Changed, or Deleted&amp;nbsp;for these delivery documents, as well as more granular events like Picking Status Changed&amp;nbsp;or Item Created&amp;nbsp;for outbound deliveries. This makes it possible to react instantly to delivery-related changes in your extensions built with the ABAP environment, while leveraging standardized events that increase development efficiency and consistency across solutions&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1170494531"&gt;Order Promising&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conversational Backorder Processing with Joule (Beta)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Imagine running a complex backorder processing (BOP) run by simply having a conversation. With the 2508 release, this is now a reality! Introduced initially as a BETA feature, from CFD release 2508.2, all users with a base license of Joule can leverage AI to automate BOP checks and processing.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Using simple, natural language commands in a chat, you can check stock situations and initiate a BOP run. For example, you can tell Joule you want to run BOP for a specific product and plant. In the background, Joule will prompt for which strategy you wish to implement with the default selection of “improve”, it creates the necessary BOP segment and variant, and processes the run—skipping multiple manual steps and app-toggling. This is a fantastic leap forward in simplifying a powerful process, and we are excited to hear how adopting this feature has enhanced your experience!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_zl1y5nmp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Display Product Availability Enhancements&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the 2508 release, we bid farewell to jumping between various transactions when seeking a comprehensive overview of product availability. The new&amp;nbsp;Display Product Availability&amp;nbsp;Fiori app is here to modernize and simplify your experience. Instead of scattered views, you now get all relevant availability information in a single, intuitive three-panel layout. At a glance, you see a high-level summary of available quantities, a detailed drill-down of MRP elements such as stocks and requirements, and a clear "Scope of Check" panel showing which supply and demand elements are included. With this release, the app now also includes the&amp;nbsp;Analyze Product Availability&amp;nbsp;feature. This allows you to dive deeper into product availability at the plant level. You can easily analyze product availability by selecting the plant you want to review and the app gives you a clear overview of confirmations, showing why certain quantities are available on specific dates and how concurrent demands impact stock or receipts. This makes it easier to respond to customer needs and share insights with stakeholders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To dig deeper, you can drill down on MRP elements, adjust the date range to see planned changes, or view the scope of check to understand exactly which stocks, receipts, and requirements are considered. Horizon settings further explain why available quantities may appear positive, zero, or even negative. By surfacing these factors in one place, the app provides transparency and confidence in managing product availability.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;See the new enhancements in the below demo video:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_88kk0xtl" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What’s more, with CFD release 2508.1, we extend these MRP features beyond the plant category to also account for storage locations. Conduct analysis and drill down on the same elements based on storage location with the same simplified UI panels within the Display Product Availability app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_0-1757600328087.jpeg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313167i0E3243B31FC5CEF6/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_0-1757600328087.jpeg" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_0-1757600328087.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Activating ATP Check for Subcontracting Outbound Delivery Creation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many customers working with the&amp;nbsp;subcontracting purchasing process&amp;nbsp;face a key challenge: preventing outbound delivery notes from being created when there is no stock available. In&amp;nbsp;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud release 2508, we address this challenge by enabling ATP checks for subcontracting outbound delivery creation. Until now, the ATP (Available-to-Promise) check was not triggered for subcontracting deliveries, meaning delivery notes could still be generated even if stock levels are zero.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This gap can create inefficiencies, as users may be instructed to pick items that simply aren’t available in the warehouse. For companies which outsource parts of their manufacturing through subcontractors, accurate stock management is essential to keep production flowing. It is critical that only available and ready-to-pick stock is passed into subcontracting deliveries. Without validation, discrepancies between SAP and the actual warehouse stock can lead to delays, wasted effort, and disruptions in the supply chain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By enabling configuration of the ATP check flag in the 2508 release, ATP &amp;nbsp;check can be enforced for subcontracting deliveries, ensuring that stock availability is validated before outbound deliveries are created. The result is clear:&amp;nbsp;consistent order promising across the supply chain, improved accuracy, and smoother end-to-end operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-973981026"&gt;Transportation Management&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stock transfer with delivery (BME) with warehouse management and transportation management(outbound)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the key challenges for supply chain specialists is managing outbound processes efficiently while ensuring seamless coordination between warehouse and transportation operations. Expanding on the outbound process defined in scope item “stock transfer with delivery (BME)”, with the 2502.3 release, we integrate both&amp;nbsp;warehouse management&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;transportation management&amp;nbsp;to streamline stock transfer orders end to end.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customers can now create intra-company Stock Transport Orders (STOs) that automatically trigger Freight Unit (FU) creation in TM and generate Outbound Deliveries, which are processed through WM for picking, packing, and loading. A key new feature is dynamic delivery splitting—if not all handling units (HUs) can be loaded, the system automatically creates a new outbound delivery for the remaining goods. Additionally, TM now supports stock transfers from WM-managed locations, and includes batch-managed material data in freight documents. These updates provide customers with a fully integrated, automated logistics flow that improves supply chain visibility, operational efficiency, and flexibility—especially in dynamic warehouse and transport environments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_mnunlowl" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enabling key user extensibility of freight document user interfaces&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This feature introduces the flexibility to adapt the user interface of applications based on&amp;nbsp;Web Dynpro ABAP (WDA)and&amp;nbsp;Floorplan Manager (FPM), giving your business greater control over how classic application screens look and function. It addresses the common challenge of rigid UIs by empowering key users and technical teams to configure freight document interfaces—such as adding or removing fields, adjusting layouts, or rearranging elements—to match specific business needs. The feature allows you to adjust the structure of main UI pages, including the&amp;nbsp;sequence and titles of tabs, as well as tailor the content of specific areas—for example, changing the&amp;nbsp;order of fields, updating&amp;nbsp;field labels, or hiding elements that aren’t relevant. With this update, we’re delivering clear value in supporting the customizing of UIs which better reflect your company’s specific use cases and processes, enabling users to interact with the applications more productively.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_1-1757600492100.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313169i2DA15738928AD168/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_1-1757600492100.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_1-1757600492100.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-777467521"&gt;Warehouse Management&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keeping up with the Suite-First strategy, in 2508 much has been done to ensure that Warehouse Management functionality supports all scope items and process variations available within SAP S/4HANA Cloud ERP. &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/warehouse-management-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-2508-release-what/ba-p/14172140?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8dG9waWNfc3Vic2NyaXB0aW9ufE1FNlpES08zSk0zU0hNfDE0MTcyMTQwfFNVQlNDUklQVElPTlN8aEs" target="_self"&gt;Take a look in more detail in this blog by Christian Ries&lt;/A&gt;. Below, we’ll focus on a few new features we want to highlight in particular.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stock Removal Strategy for direct goods movement postings (EWM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;A much requested feature which we’re happy to roll out to customers, the&amp;nbsp;Post Goods Movement&amp;nbsp;app now includes a new button that triggers the stock removal strategy. This automatically determines the optimal storage bin, handling unit, and batch or serial number when posting a direct goods issue. Available for goods issue postings in manufacturing orders and reservations, this feature streamlines the process by aligning with your stock removal strategy to select the best storage bin. The result is greater efficiency and accuracy when posting goods issues, reducing manual effort and errors. Specifically designed for goods issue of production components, this enhancement ensures that the right stock is used at the right time—supporting faster, more reliable production execution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_2-1757600659454.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313170iD65970B85A21C94B/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_2-1757600659454.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_2-1757600659454.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summarized JIT Calls&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This feature enables efficient handling of outbound deliveries that reference summarized Just-in-Time (JIT) calls within Warehouse Management. By integrating seamlessly with JIT processes, it ensures that deliveries comply with configured underdelivery and overdelivery tolerances. Leveraging the built-in warehouse management capabilities—such as picking, packing, staging, and loading—you can now handle outbound processing of summarized JIT calls (scope item 2EM) more effectively. Outbound deliveries with JIT references can be easily selected and processed within warehouse management, improving efficiency, accuracy, and reliability, while directly benefiting customers through more consistent and timely deliveries.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_z9m27pyp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integrating Extended Warehouse Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Many of our customers have sophisticated supply chains and warehouse processes which involve central hubs and different satellite entities. With 2508, we are excited to roll out an integration scenario which will make managing such a set up much simpler. With the new communication scenario, Logistics - S/4HANA Extended Warehouse Management Integration (SAP_COM_0A58), you can now integrate a decentralized Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) system in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition with your SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition. This integration provides essential services to distribute and maintain inbound and outbound deliveries across hybrid landscapes. This helps your organization leverage existing EWM investments while expanding your cloud footprint, ensuring seamless data flow for critical delivery processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_3-1757600719078.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313172i37DC007D8F4861C7/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_3-1757600719078.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_3-1757600719078.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In-house Repair with Warehouse Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A common challenge in after-sales service is managing the logistics of returning repaired products back to customers quickly and efficiently. With the 2508 release, we have enhanced the&amp;nbsp;in-house repair process (scope item 3XK) by integrating warehouse management. This should streamline this process enabling companies to more efficiently define and execute their in-house repair workflows.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The process begins when a returned product is received and logged into the warehouse, where serial numbers are verified and the item is moved to a clarification zone for inspection. If an in-house repair is needed, a follow-up activity is created, ensuring the right material and serial number are tracked through the repair cycle. Once the product is fixed, an outbound delivery order is generated, and warehouse management takes over again to pick, pack, stage, and load the item for shipment back to the customer.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_4-1757600770510.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313173i7B10F8E9520C3EA4/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Greg_Hutcheon1_4-1757600770510.png" alt="Greg_Hutcheon1_4-1757600770510.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By leveraging warehouse management capabilities, organizations can optimize every step of the return—from picking and packing the repaired product to staging and loading it for shipment. This ensures accuracy, reduces manual effort, and speeds up turnaround times, ultimately improving the customer experience while driving efficiency in logistics operations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. See the full process in the below End-to-End demo.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-580954016"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Summary&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 2508 release highlights in the supply chain management area of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition should help optimize your supply chain and logistics processes.

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1630890760"&gt;Why Data Quality in SAP IBP?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rahulmohnot_2-1757476518055.png" style="width: 938px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311991i2C934C0F4479A51D/image-dimensions/938x370/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="938" height="370" role="button" title="rahulmohnot_2-1757476518055.png" alt="rahulmohnot_2-1757476518055.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The success of SAP IBP hinges on the availability of quality data from all relevant sources across the organization. Without this foundation of high-quality data, the collaborative and cross-functional nature of IBP will be severely hampered, leading to flawed insights, poor decisions, and an ineffective planning process that fails to deliver the expected business benefits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, organizations implementing SAP IBP must prioritize data quality initiatives as a critical component of their implementation and ongoing operations to ensure that they can leverage the full potential of the integrated planning platform. This often involves establishing data governance processes, data quality and validation routines, and ongoing monitoring of data quality across all the heterogeneous systems and departments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I, as an IBP solution architect and consultant, have seen data quality impact on various functions and across all levels.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Accurate Forecasting and Demand Planning:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;IBP heavily relies on accurate demand forecasts to plan production, inventory, and supply chain activities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Poor data quality in historical sales data, market trends, or customer information will lead to inaccurate forecasts, resulting in either overstocking (leading to waste and costs) or understocking (leading to lost sales and customer dissatisfaction).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Reliable Supply Planning:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accurate demand forecasts and reliable data on &lt;STRONG&gt;current &lt;/STRONG&gt;inventory levels, lead times, and supplier capabilities are essential for effective supply planning.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Inaccurate data in these areas can lead to production delays, material shortages, and increased costs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Effective Financial Planning:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;IBP integrates financial planning with operational plans. Accurate financial data, including costs, revenues, and profitability, is crucial for making sound financial decisions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate financial projections and budgets, impacting the overall financial health of the organization.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Informed Decision-Making:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;IBP aims to provide a holistic view of the business, enabling informed decision- making across different departments.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If the underlying data is inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent, the insights derived from IBP will be flawed, leading to poor strategic and operational decisions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Seamless Collaboration:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;IBP fosters collaboration among different departments. Consistent and reliable data ensures that all stakeholders are working with the same information, facilitating effective communication and alignment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data quality issues can create friction and mistrust among teams, hindering the collaborative nature of IBP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Performance Measurement and Improvement:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;IBP involves monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress and identify areas for improvement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accurate data is essential for measuring performance accurately and identifying the root causes of any issues. Poor data quality can lead to misleading performance metrics and ineffective improvement initiatives.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data quality is paramount for IBP success. Without high quality data, the benefits of IBP cannot be fully realized, and the organization risks making poor decisions that can negatively impact its bottom line and overall performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1434377255"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1237863750"&gt;5C Framework for SAP IBP Data&amp;nbsp;Validation&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The proposed 5Cs are the core traits which determine whether the data is fit for the SAP IBP planning purpose. By adhering to these 5C's, organizations can improve their data quality, leading to more reliable insights, better decision-making, and increased operational efficiency. It is important to note that maintaining high data quality is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and improvement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;C&lt;/STRONG&gt;onformity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;C&lt;/STRONG&gt;onsistency&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;C&lt;/STRONG&gt;ompleteness&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;C&lt;/STRONG&gt;omprehensiveness&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;C&lt;/STRONG&gt;oncurrency&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rahulmohnot_1-1757476198456.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311989iC5386E1CDA453FDC/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="rahulmohnot_1-1757476198456.png" alt="rahulmohnot_1-1757476198456.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 1: 5Cs of Data Quality Framework&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1170432964"&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Conformity&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This aspect of the SAP IBP data quality ensures that data adheres to predefined rules and standards regarding format, type, and size.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Case for the predefined rules: In SAP IBP there are predefined special characters which cannot be used&lt;/EM&gt;.

Consistency ensures that information is uniform and comparable throughout the organization. However, when SAP IBP receives data from multiple sources such as ERP systems, data warehouses, cloud-based data lakes, third-party systems, home-grown applications, production planning system, transport planning system and planners' Excel sheets, maintaining data consistency becomes key area to focus on. This diversity of data sources, if ignored, can lead to discrepancies in data formats, definitions, and quality, potentially compromising the accuracy of SAP IBP's planning processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;To ensure consistency in &lt;STRONG&gt;master Data&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP IBP provides some in-build checks which must be configured like attribute checks and mandatory attributes.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757480923919.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312010iAB696ADFEB37DDC8/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rahulmohnot_0-1757480923919.png" alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757480923919.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 3: IBP Master Data object consistency checks with attribute checks&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;For IBP &lt;STRONG&gt;transactional data,&lt;/STRONG&gt; we can ensure consistency by adding a mandatory attribute from compound master data in planning level for the key figure. Such configuration avoids inconsistent transactional data flowing into the system.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481193181.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312012iD543D2C2509A32F2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rahulmohnot_0-1757481193181.png" alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481193181.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 4: IBP mandatory attribute used in base planning level of key figures&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;It is important to understand that SAP IBP does not inherently guarantee consistency within object hierarchies such as Product, Customer, and Location hierarchies. Therefore, the Customer and System Integrator's consultants must collaboratively develop a strategy to ensure consistency in parent-child relationships (1:N cardinality) for hierarchical data objects. This proactive approach is crucial for accurate aggregation and disaggregation, enabling effective and actionable insights.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481428149.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312013iF38B85A2F77186EB/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="rahulmohnot_0-1757481428149.png" alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481428149.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 5: IBP Data Hierarchy with Parent Child relationship&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;To ensure the correct parent-child relationships, one of the approaches is to extract a parent-child combination in excel sheet and create a pivot table on unique records. All children must have single parent otherwise aggregation and disaggregation will be wrong, leading to wrong planning results.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-777405954"&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Completeness&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The completeness of data refers to the state where all the necessary and relevant data points required for the specific planning process and the overall IBP framework are present and available within the system. It means that there are no significant gaps or missing pieces of information that hinder the ability to perform accurate analysis, generate reliable plan and make informed decisions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481587428.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312014iBA60F9F81A06D35A/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="rahulmohnot_0-1757481587428.png" alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481587428.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 6: Incomplete/Broken Supply Network&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 6 clearly demonstrates the incompleteness of the data from the supply chain network where capacity data at resource is missing along with a broken network with respect to missing lanes. Such an incomplete dataset will generate improper planning results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To avoid the incomplete data flowing into the IBP system, we need to develop interfaces outside the IBP system using ABAP validations in SAP S4 or BW4HANA or CIDS to identify the incompleteness and generate a report for correction by clients IT Team / Data Management Team. By using the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Manage Rules for Master Data Maintenance&lt;/STRONG&gt;" feature in IBP, we can effectively define the correct "Subnetwork" node and diagnose which node is disrupting the supply chain network. Example: All Location product combinations to pass through following checks updating a corresponding custom attribute which finally impacts the subnetwork.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1.Inbound: Master data rule to check for Location source in Location Source object.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2.Inbound: Master data rule to check source production in Source Production Header object.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3.Outbound: Master data rule to check Ship-from with product combination in Location Source object.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4.Outbound: Master data rule to check Location Product combination in Source Customer object.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;5.Outbound: Master data rule to check Location Product combination in production source Item.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;* This is just an approach which may differ from project to project and network schema variations.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-580892449"&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Comprehensiveness&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data Comprehensiveness refers to the degree to which all the necessary and relevant data required to support the IBP processes, models, and overall planning objectives is available, accessible, and integrated within the IBP system. It goes beyond just having completeness. It entails:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Breadth of Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Having data across all relevant dimensions and business areas that are within the scope of the IBP implementation. This includes data related to sales, demand, supply, inventory, finance, and potentially other relevant areas.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Depth of Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Having data at the appropriate level of detail required for the planning activities, ensuring that data is available for all the products, customers, locations, and other relevant entities that are included in the IBP planning scope.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481780006.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312015iF9D1E18B777189EB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rahulmohnot_0-1757481780006.png" alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481780006.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 7: Data Comprehensiveness covers all the IBP data objects including each attribute&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;Example for missing comprehensiveness can be missing key attribute values like Lead Times, Lot Sizes, rounding values, Quota split ratios, Cost rates, On-hand Inventory for few combinations only in IBP system. It may cause unreliable planning results. To systematically capture all such cases, IBP custom alerts can be valuable to report missing attributes. Along with this the IBP’s feature like &lt;STRONG&gt;“Discover Pattern using Machine Learning”, “Find Numerical Outliers”&lt;/STRONG&gt; can help identify the completeness gaps.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481925031.png" style="width: 348px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312016i38AD2187C9AD3F25/image-dimensions/348x210/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="348" height="210" role="button" title="rahulmohnot_0-1757481925031.png" alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757481925031.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 8: IBP Feature for data pattern discovery and numeric outliers&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-384378944"&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Concurrency&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every business executive stives to strike alignment between business strategic planning and execution system. Concurrency in planning and execution represents a paradigm shift from traditional sequential approaches, enabling organizations to adapt dynamically in fast-paced environments. This methodology interweaves planning and action in real time, allowing adjustments based on evolving conditions while maintaining operational continuity. The planning and execution should be coupled like Yin-Yang.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757482100509.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312019iEA77A07D97F7E1B5/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="rahulmohnot_0-1757482100509.png" alt="rahulmohnot_0-1757482100509.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure 9: Yin-Yang of Planning and Execution&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From IBP planning perspective the concurrency is achieved while keeping it updated with the latest execution data. The execution data represents the latest customer orders, internal goods movements between Plants and RDCs, latest production orders, and vendor related purchase orders are integrated daily or even lesser frequency to IBP. This enables IBP planners to have complete visibility of the execution system, and they can align the plan or coordinate with execution teams to keep working on the same organizational objective.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusive Remarks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At its core, the success of SAP IBP depends entirely on high-quality data. Without a solid foundation of accurate, reliable information, the platform's ability to facilitate collaboration and integrated planning is undermined. This leads to flawed insights, poor decision-making, and ultimately, a failure to deliver the expected business benefits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key impacts of poor data quality include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inaccurate forecasting&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;supply planning&lt;/STRONG&gt;, resulting in issues like over- or under-stocking.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Flawed financial planning&lt;/STRONG&gt; and projections.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Uninformed decisions&lt;/STRONG&gt; because the underlying data is inconsistent or incomplete.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Friction among teams&lt;/STRONG&gt; due to a lack of trust in shared data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Misleading performance metrics&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which hinder effective improvement initiatives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, prioritizing data quality through robust governance, validation, and monitoring is not just a best practice—it's essential for organizations to fully leverage SAP IBP's potential.
