    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This fifth post in my series gives an overview of latest UX innovations in &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass, products for managing your spend (procurement) and external workforce&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;For SAP Ariba: Joule is now available for selected products, on-boarding guidance is provided by WalkMe, and we have some additional AI-assistance in SAP Ariba Category Management, amongst other enhancements. For SAP Fieldglass, Joule is now available too, and the SOW (Statement of Work) dashboard can now be adapted per user role, ensuring that users see what fits best for them. Also, you can now use generative AI for importing SOWs from documents.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1608756847"&gt;SAP Ariba&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are the recent UX innovations that I have picked:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On-boarding guidance via WalkMe Digital Adoption Platform.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule, our AI copilot, available for selected SAP Ariba products.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;UX enhancements in Category Management: Supplier preferencing, Strategy and Plan enhancements for collaboration and AI-insights, plus some more minor enhancements in details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integration of the SAP User Research Panel into selected products’ built-in user feedback surveys.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1541326061"&gt;On-boarding guidance via WalkMe&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When new employees join the procurement team, we now make it easier for them to get up and running with SAP Ariba by providing enhanced step-by-step guidance on how to get typical tasks done in the system. With the 2508 release, we provide WalkMe for the following SAP Ariba products:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Buying&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Contracts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Invoice Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Sourcing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Supplier Risk&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;WalkMe offers engaging, intuitive, role-based guidance to help&amp;nbsp;user quickly achieve value by minimizing barriers during initial use of the product and creating a great first experience. Figure 1 gives you an idea of what this looks like, showing first the list of activities available for the current user context within SAP Ariba Sourcing, and then an example of one of the guidance steps (the fourth step after the user had selected “Create a guided sourcing project”).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: An example of WalkMe for SAP Ariba Sourcing.

Do they value your custom highly? Or at the opposite extreme, do they see you as a nuisance, i.e. low volume but high effort and hence unprofitable?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supplier preferencing is an established approach that helps organizations understand how they are perceived by vendors. By leveraging this insight, businesses can strengthen supplier relationships, foster collaboration, and improve supply chain effectiveness.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supplier preferencing involves evaluating how suppliers view a buying organization based on two key dimensions:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Attractiveness of Account&lt;/STRONG&gt;: How appealing the buying organization is to the supplier, influenced by factors like reputation, growth potential, and ease of doing business.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Relative Value of Business&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The monetary value or strategic importance the buying organization's spend brings to the supplier.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each dimension can be assessed as “high” or “low”, resulting in four possible categories Core, Development, Nuisance and Exploitable, as explained in the&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Documentation: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ariba/88ea813a3d0f42878f90775648ed03ca/efcd0979d5984ea1abfa9b2abbce1a7f.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Supplier Preferencing&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;We now provide an intuitive user experience for buyers to apply supplier preferencing very easily, and get an easy to understand overview for each supplier and for each strategy and plan you have created for buying from that supplier. Figure 3 shows an example for a fictitious supplier called SpeedShip, where the outcome of assessments for various strategy and plans are shown.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3: Supplier preferencing example in SAP Ariba Category Management.

The &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/japan/design/stories-resources/sap-user-research-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP User Research Panel&lt;/A&gt; gives users the opportunity to sign-up to give feedback to SAP directly. We launched it nearly two years ago, see for example &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/your-voice-matters-join-the-sap-user-research-panel/ba-p/13572934" target="_blank"&gt;Your voice matters! Join the SAP User Research Panel&lt;/A&gt;. Since then many users across all areas have signed up.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We would like to encourage users of SAP Ariba to sign up too, and to make this easier, we have introduced a direct link to it from the user feedback survey. Users of SAP Ariba Category Management and SAP Ariba Supplier Risk occasionally receive a popup with a short survey asking for feedback on the product. Now, at the end of this survey, they are offered a link to sign up to the user resarch panel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find out more in the documentation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ariba/88ea813a3d0f42878f90775648ed03ca/947e4b45dfca4f169a41ae9612a30ab8.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;parentHref=https://help.sap.com/whats-new/6a6876bb02204429bfc72cf8b861a866?locale=en-US%26Version=SAP%2BAriba%2B2508%26q=panel&amp;amp;parentName=What%27s+New+in+SAP+Procurement+and+SAP+Business+Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP User Research Panel for SAP Ariba Category Management&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ariba/88ea813a3d0f42878f90775648ed03ca/9073399125eb4de78b60fc38a268abcd.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;parentHref=https://help.sap.com/whats-new/6a6876bb02204429bfc72cf8b861a866?locale=en-US%26Version=SAP%2BAriba%2B2508%26q=panel&amp;amp;parentName=What%27s+New+in+SAP+Procurement+and+SAP+Business+Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP User Research Panel for SAP Ariba Supplier Risk&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--30781979"&gt;Further Information&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;For an overview of the key innovations with the 2508 release of SAP Ariba, have a look at this blog post:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/spend-management-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ariba-2508-release-key-innovations-preview/ba-p/14159593" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Ariba 2508 Release Key Innovations Preview&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-413361880"&gt;SAP Fieldglass&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule is now available for SAP Fieldglass, the Statement of Work (SOW) dashboard has been enhanced to allow role-specific customized views, and you can now use generative AI for importing SOWs from documents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--369957639"&gt;Joule for SAP Fieldglass&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our AI copilot Joule helps users for these specific activities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Selecting job posting templates&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Selecting statement of work templates&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Completing work items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Viewing quarterly trends&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Running reports&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Closing workers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Searching help content&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As an example of how Joule makes work easier for users, consider finding the right template for a job posting: rather than scanning through available templates, you can just give Joule the position or project, a description, and a few other details, and Joule will provide recommendations for which template to use. Once you have chosen a template, Joule can auto-populate some of the fields, speeding the process up for you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can also use Joule for analytical queries: as Joule to show you quarterly trends, and Joule will show you them in the form of graphs embedded within the Joule UI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 8 shows Joule when first opened in SAP Fieldglass, with hints as clickable buttons for what you can ask for.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 8: Joule in SAP Fieldglass.

This helps track overall SOW progress, maintain budget control, and enable informed decision-making. &amp;nbsp;Last year, we introduced the SOW Dashboard, providing a comprehensive real-time view of critical SOW data (see &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-innovations-in-public-cloud-products-joule-ai-entry-points-apple/ba-p/13594954" target="_blank"&gt;my last year’s blog post&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Users in different business roles need to interact with the SOW, and each role has a unique set of details relevant to them for overseeing the health of the SOW. Now, the SOW dashboard supports customized views based on user roles, which streamlines the information displayed, so that users see only what is most relevant to them. Hence, they get a more focused and efficient experience tailored to their unique needs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 9 shows an example of the SOW Dashboard set up for a user focused on project status and task management. Figure 10 shows an example for a user focused on financials and spend task management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 9: SAP Fieldglass SOW dashboard customized for users focused on project status and task management.

Now, we have significantly improved the user experience by leveraging generative AI to automate a lot of this work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Fieldglass has integrated SAP Document AI, so that users can automate the extraction and transformation of statement of work content from uploaded documents. This combined AI approach parses the source files, identifies relevant content, and generates a structured, accurate draft statement of work, reducing manual effort while improving data consistency and completeness. Figure 10 shows how users now have the new AI-enabled workflow option for creating a statement of work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 11: New AI-enabled option for creating a statement of work in SAP Fieldglass.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In early 2024, we discovered something surprising.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The average user spent just &lt;STRONG&gt;1 minute and 14 seconds&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the SAP Build Store. Even more striking: &lt;STRONG&gt;nearly 60% of users left within 15 seconds.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;We had invested in pre-designed, ready-to-use solutions, what we call &lt;EM&gt;Templates&lt;/EM&gt;, to accelerate project creation, reduce repetitive tasks, and improve efficiency across SAP Build. But the data told us something else: the feature was practically invisible.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1866916613"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The challenge: our locked treasure&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Why was engagement so low? Our research revealed a few key reasons:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Terminology like “Store” and “Ready to Use” was confusing&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The design was outdated and not aligned with SAP’s Fiori guidelines&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Navigation was weak, leaving users without clear entry points&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Most users only discovered the feature via a lobby shortcut. Without it, usage dropped dramatically&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;We had a powerful capability, but no visibility.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="The original design: outdated, unclear, and often overlooked" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/302263i5113691C1C2C53EB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="OLDSAPCummunity.png" alt="The original design: outdated, unclear, and often overlooked" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;The original design: outdated, unclear, and often overlooked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1670403108"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1473889603"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Strategic context and research&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;This redesign was not done in isolation. It aligned with the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build 2025 strategy&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which emphasizes predefined processes and best practices to accelerate time to value.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;We also reviewed how similar solutions in the market are positioned. A common theme was the strong emphasis on clarity and discoverability, which reinforced the importance of making SAP’s Templates more visible and actionable&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1277376098"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The big idea: make Templates impossible to ignore&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Our guiding principle was simple: &lt;STRONG&gt;Visibility, Clarity, Efficiency.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;If users did not see it, they would not use it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;So the mission was twofold:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Make Templates more discoverable, even without shortcuts&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Clarify their purpose so users could quickly understand and act&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1080862593"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-884349088"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Transformation in action&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;We redesigned the experience with these goals in mind:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consistency:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A modern, structured UI aligned with SAP’s design language&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Clearer pathways and filters so users could find relevant templates more easily&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cards:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A more engaging presentation with images, clearer actions, and hierarchy&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clarity:&lt;/STRONG&gt; New status badges and improved copy to reduce confusion&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Guidance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A new dialog to help users understand the difference between Pre-built and Sample templates&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Terminology:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;We also introduced several naming changes to reduce confusion and better reflect the feature’s purpose, such as renaming &lt;EM&gt;“Store”&lt;/EM&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;Templates,&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;EM&gt;“Ready to Use”&lt;/EM&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;Pre-built,&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;“Template”&lt;/EM&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;Sample&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

Joule for Business&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_0-1755705303664.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303114iBA44C9D3ACCDCE30/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_0-1755705303664.png" alt="sangdao_0-1755705303664.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In today's fast-moving digital landscape, businesses need solutions that simplify processes and enhance efficiency. SAP’s &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Business&lt;/STRONG&gt; stands at the forefront of this transformation. By embedding artificial intelligence directly into SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, Joule for Business acts as a digital assistant that helps users navigate complex tasks through natural language interaction. With its intuitive design and AI-driven functionality, Joule is not just an assistant—it’s a strategic partner for every business user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/382ChL5?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1166611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_1-1755705303670.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303112iCF154B51114000E6/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_1-1755705303670.png" alt="sangdao_1-1755705303670.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Simplifying Service Contract Management with Joule for Business &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_2-1755705303683.png" style="width: 535px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303113i6C38FAD8312EDE1C/image-dimensions/535x301?v=v2" width="535" height="301" role="button" title="sangdao_2-1755705303683.png" alt="sangdao_2-1755705303683.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For Customer Service Managers, &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Business&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a game-changer. It allows managers to express their business needs using everyday language, eliminating the need for specialized technical knowledge. Joule then guides users directly to key service management applications, such as the Manage Service Contracts app, Service Management Overview, and Service Contracts Dashboard. The result? Users experience faster navigation, enhanced satisfaction, and improved operational efficiency. By providing seamless access to apps like Mass Processing of Service Contracts and Monitor Auto Renewal Logs, Joule ensures that service contract management becomes a streamlined and user-friendly process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Streamlining Solution Order Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_3-1755705303695.png" style="width: 539px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303115i54E6F51C6CA8281D/image-dimensions/539x303?v=v2" width="539" height="303" role="button" title="sangdao_3-1755705303695.png" alt="sangdao_3-1755705303695.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Business&lt;/STRONG&gt; also empowers Solution Order Specialists to work more effectively. By understanding business requirements expressed in natural language, Joule navigates users directly to relevant solution order management applications. Key apps such as Solution Orders Overview and Solution Order Profitability are now just a simple command away. This not only saves time but also allows specialists to focus on core activities, driving productivity and enhancing decision-making. Joule thus bridges the gap between user intent and system functionality, transforming solution order management into a more accessible and efficient workflow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-Assisted Sales Order Status Check&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_4-1755705303716.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303117iFB39E9D5119D1DCB/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_4-1755705303716.png" alt="sangdao_4-1755705303716.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond navigation, &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Business&lt;/STRONG&gt; delivers tangible value in sales operations. With its AI-powered sales order status check, Joule enables businesses to monitor whether sales orders are on track and identify any issues hindering fulfillment. By translating complex fulfillment statuses into plain language, Joule helps users quickly understand bottlenecks, view potential causes, receive resolution suggestions, and seamlessly navigate to the appropriate applications. This functionality improves efficiency and accelerates issue resolution, ensuring that sales processes remain agile and customer-centric.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Read more about Joule: &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1473952228"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1.2.

It achieves this by providing instant guidance grounded in an unmatched knowledge base that is exclusive to SAP and expertly curated. This foundation includes over 200,000 pages of documentation, SAP Notes, Knowledge Base Articles, and terabytes of content from SAP Communities. By tapping into this authoritative source, consultants can get fast, specific answers to complex questions, supporting every phase of a project from discover to run and saving up to 1.5 hours per day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond its extensive knowledge base, Joule offers powerful SAP-specific code intelligence, built upon a fine-tuned model trained on 250 million lines of ABAP code. This enables consultants to generate code from natural language prompts and significantly reduce the time needed to interpret unfamiliar code by up to 40%. The combination of expert guidance and advanced coding assistance directly impacts project timelines. This acceleration can shorten a typical 12-to-18-month project by up to 14%, translating to a reduction of 1.5 to 2.5 months in the overall project cycle&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Read more about Joule for Consultants: &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant/sap-consulting-capability.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant/sap-consulting-capability.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1277438723"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Developers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_6-1755705303755.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303118iD9A2AAF18D0B2686/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_6-1755705303755.png" alt="sangdao_6-1755705303755.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule for developers is a generative AI assistant embedded within the ABAP development tools to enhance productivity and accelerate the software development lifecycle. Its primary goal is to help developers write, test, and deliver optimized, bug-free code in ABAP Cloud in the shortest possible time. For developers working in environments like SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, this translates into a significant reduction in the time and effort required for both writing and testing code, leading to a faster realization of value from their development work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The assistant provides several key capabilities to achieve this. It offers predictive code completion to generate ABAP code directly in the editor and a Joule chat feature for getting support on development questions using natural language. It can also explain existing development objects or selected lines of code to improve comprehension. To enhance quality, Joule assists in generating and improving ABAP unit tests and can create test classes specifically for CDS entities, helping ensure robust and reliable applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-951842499"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.

One of the standout features of this release is the introduction of AI-generated explanations for fixed asset key figures. These insights are delivered in natural language and help users clearly understand the origins and calculations behind critical values such as depreciation and net book value. This capability simplifies interpretation, allowing users to grasp financial figures and value changes more quickly, enhancing productivity and reducing the time needed for recurring financial tasks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, this innovation comes with AI-assisted asset master data creation, enabling users to enter data using simple conversational commands. This approach decreases the effort and time required for data entry and onboarding while improving accuracy and data governance through intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. SAP Business AI is central to these enhancements, providing detailed explanations and support that facilitate better decision-making and enhance user satisfaction. This release reaffirms SAP's commitment to delivering efficient and user-centric solutions in asset accounting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-687898208"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.2.

AI-assisted processing of incoming quality certificates with SAP Document AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_8iqjpmzs" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_9-1755705303845.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303124iB349B8E7D1C6A901/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_9-1755705303845.png" alt="sangdao_9-1755705303845.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the 2508 release of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, we are excited to introduce SAP Document AI, a groundbreaking innovation that integrates generative AI into quality management processes. This advanced AI feature revolutionizes the handling of incoming quality certificates, significantly enhancing operational efficiency for our customers. By automating the extraction of relevant information from both paper and digital documents and incorporating it into SAP workflows, SAP Document AI streamlines the processing of supplier quality certificates. This leads to substantial reductions in manual efforts, faster processing times, and minimized human errors. As a result, quality technicians are liberated from monotonous tasks, enabling them to concentrate on more strategic and value-adding activities, which, in turn, helps companies expedite stock releases, minimize inspection-related production delays, and enhance overall throughput.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Moreover, SAP Document AI enhances accuracy and reliability by automatically matching quality certificates with system records and updating their status, ensuring that no document is misplaced and compliance is consistently maintained. Additionally, intelligent error handling fortifies system resilience and trust. One of the most compelling features of this solution is its seamless integration into the SAP S/4HANA Cloud experience, offered as a ready-to-use capability that requires no custom development, thereby providing customers with immediate value and swift ROI. As we continue to incorporate AI, data, and automation into our ERP offerings, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition serves as a cornerstone for smarter, more agile operations. The introduction of SAP Document AI exemplifies our commitment to supporting customers in future-proofing their business, driving continuous improvement, and fostering innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-294871198"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.4. Unlock seamless data access with AI-assisted easy enterprise search&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/ViV9bhN?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1166515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_10-1755705303863.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303122i96EFB48D08DF0F65/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_10-1755705303863.png" alt="sangdao_10-1755705303863.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Accessing business data is now even more intuitive with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-assisted easy enterprise search&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which allows users to search using natural language. Instead of navigating through complex structures, a simple query like “Show me sales orders overall status in process” or “Show me open sales orders that have a net value greater than 100 EUR” provides relevant results instantly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system adapts the search results based on the user’s role, ensuring that only the most relevant business objects are presented. This not only improves search accuracy but also accelerates insight extraction—making it easier to act quickly and confidently in a data-rich environment. To enable this feature, select the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;'enable AI natural language search' &lt;/EM&gt;checkbox in the user profile settings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--30725026"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3.

AI-assisted smart solution for situations in My Home&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/tSpQrWC?ltr=v&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1206840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_11-1755705303878.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303121i869846807142FB0B/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_11-1755705303878.png" alt="sangdao_11-1755705303878.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508 release brings a new dimension of intelligence to the user experience with the introduction of the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-assisted smart solution for situations in My Home&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Currently available in beta testing, this innovative feature simplifies the resolution of business-critical situations by dynamically guiding users through resolution steps—directly from the homepage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This smart solution leverages generative AI to adapt the user interface in real time, presenting timely insights and suggested actions tailored to the specific business context. Designed to support fast, informed decisions, it transforms traditionally manual and multi-step tasks into a seamless, click-efficient experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Accessible from the SAP S/4HANA Cloud homepage, the solution enables situation handling in just a few clicks—significantly reducing the time and effort required to take action. Instead of navigating through multiple screens, users are presented with&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dynamic cards&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;that surface key information and associated actions. These cards act as entry points to resolve issues directly, eliminating the need for in-depth navigation and enhancing day-to-day productivity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The substantial benefits of this innovation include saving time, reducing complexity, and improving the quality of decision-making. Generative AI delivers context-aware recommendations and outcomes that are both trustworthy and relevant—built on enterprise-grade intelligence. This intuitive approach allows users to act confidently with minimal effort, ultimately boosting overall efficiency across key operational processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To illustrate its impact, consider a common example: a sales representative receives a notification that a sales quotation is about to expire. In a conventional workflow, the user would open the situation, navigate to the quotation, manually edit the details, save the changes, and then return to resolve the situation. With the AI-assisted solution in My Home, these steps are consolidated into a single, streamlined flow—demonstrating how user effort is minimized while responsiveness is maximized.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Join the SAP beta testing for the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/3910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;latest AI-assisted user experience features in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

Currently in beta testing, it allows users to tailor their applications and insight tiles using natural language.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Applications can be added in just two clicks, including a preview to confirm suitability. This streamlines customization, especially for new or infrequent users, by offering AI-powered suggestions, application descriptions, and live KPIs for dynamic tiles.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This sixth post in my series gives an overview of user experience innovations in SAP Customer Experience and SAP Concur. For SAP Customer Experience, look at the new AI agents and the capability to build custom agents, plus AI innovations for marketeers in SAP Emarsys, and Joule and AI order summaries in SAP Sales Cloud Version 2. &amp;nbsp;SAP Concur takes travel planning to the next level with the whole new travel experience, complemented by the new Joule Booking Agent enabling users to use natural language to book a trip.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before reading this, do read the first blog post introducing the series and providing general information about Joule and central entry points and services, along with links to all the published parts of this blog post series:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1609675603"&gt;SAP Customer Experience&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The user experience highlights I have picked are all AI-related:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI Agents.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Emarsys UX innovations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Sales Cloud Version 2 UX innovations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This news article summarizes what’s new overall for SAP Customer Experience, beyond UX-related innovations:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2025/07/connected-growth-sap-cx-q2-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Connected for Growth: What’s New with SAP Customer Experience in Q2 2025&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1542244817"&gt;AI Agents&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As I explained in part 1 of this series, AI agents work in the background to give a greatly enhanced user experience. A number of powerful AI agents are available for SAP Customer Experience, via the package &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ai-catalog/?packages=cc485586-3c5c-427b-a3d1-12b0bb138229&amp;amp;aiType=ai_agent_package" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Joule Premium for Customer Experience&lt;/A&gt;.

Figure 1 shows an example, where the user starts out by stating that they are looking for shoes to wear for two mile long walks while wearing a suit. Two shoes are suggested, and the user asks which one is comfortable right away, since he doesn’t want a long break in period. The agent recommends one model, and the customer then asks for a recommendation for a belt to match, which the agent promptly gives him.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: Shopping Agent for the Shopping Assistant from SAP Commerce Cloud.

It enables customers to ask questions with natural language and provides answers based on your company’s business knowledge residing in the SAP system. Hence, it is able to resolve common inquiries and issues, giving customers a good experience.

A typical combination is booking a flight, a hotel and a rental car. Up until now, you have had to book each item separately and take care that the dates and time match. Now, with the new Concur Travel experience, planning and booking is much easier: you can enter the start and end dates for your flight, and the new feature &lt;EM&gt;Match Flight Booking&lt;/EM&gt; is applied to the hotel and car, so that dates and time match automatically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figures 7 to 11 show what this looks like: Figure 7 shows the start screen, where you select which items you want to include (flight, hotel, car, train). Figure 8 shows the flight view, where flight dates have been entered. Figure 9 shows the hotel search, with the default selection “Based on flight selection”, and similarly Figure 10 shows the rental car search, with pick-up and return times calculated based on the flight schedule.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This seventh and last post in my series gives an overview innovations in our UI tools and technologies, making it ever easier to design, build and integrate UIs, for both web and mobile applications. For designing apps, web and mobile, we have a new SAP Design System portal and UI Kits in Figma. For developers, we have added further AI assistance, as well as many individual improvements, including support for the latest international accessibility standard WCAG 2.2. &lt;EM&gt;Fun fact: SAPUI5 is now used on all 7 continents – yes, Antarctica too!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before reading this, do read the first blog post introducing the series and providing general information about Joule and central entry points and services, along with links to all the published parts of this blog post series:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The above post also gives an update on building your own Joule agents, so I will not cover that here, but rather focus on web and mobile UI development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1609793836"&gt;Design News&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1542363050"&gt;SAP Design System Portal and UI Kits in Figma&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We recently introduced the new &lt;A href="http://www.sap.com/design-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Design System portal&lt;/A&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;that &lt;/SPAN&gt;brings together the product design guidelines SAP Fiori for web, SAP Fiori for iOS, and SAP Fiori for Android, as well as to the new digital design system guidelines. With its enhanced usability, simplified versioning and improved performance, designers (and developers!) get a better user experience compared with the previous SAP Fiori design guidelines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: The SAP Design System portal start page.

Adopting the latest standards gives applications a true cutting edge, ensuring that solutions are inclusive and meet the diverse needs of users globally.&amp;nbsp;When creating apps with SAP Build and SAPUI5, developers can leverage the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, two of the key new requirements in the 2.2 version are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The minimum target size of an interactive element now needs to be 24x24 px, so that users don’t accidentally activate a neighbouring element.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Each operation that can be performed by dragging can also be performed alternatively without dragging – so that people who cannot use a mouse to drag can still use the UI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;See more details:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sapui5-is-leading-the-way-in-accessibility-with-wcag-2-2/ba-p/14101596" target="_blank"&gt;SAPUI5 is Leading the Way in Accessibility with WCAG 2.2&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-166768515"&gt;SAP Fiori tools – open source, faster app creation, more AI&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most powerful recent innovations is the AI-powered project accelerator from SAP Fiori tools, which allows you to create a fully functional app with database tables, CDS-Views, OData service and a Fiori element list report UI based on a sketch of what you want. I introduced this in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q1-2025-update-part-7-ui-design-and-technology-for-web/ba-p/14034290" target="_blank"&gt;my Q1 update post&lt;/A&gt; from March. This can now be started from Joule in SAP Build Code. Also, it has been further enhanced, and is also available as open source, so that our developer community can make contributions themselves.

I have picked two enhancements to highlight here for developers using SAPUI5 and SAP Fiori elements on OData V4, which are covered in the following subsections:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support for inline edit for object pages.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support for the analytical table on the object page.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--172407145"&gt;Support for inline edit for object pages&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can now develop object pages where users can directly edit fields within facets, without having to first press the “Edit” button and go into edit mode. Figure 5 shows an example from a test application.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 5: Inline editing of fields in an object page with SAP Fiori elements for OData V4.

Now, developers using SAPUI5 and SAP Fiori elements on OData V4 can include an analytical table into one of the facets of an object page. Figure 6 shows an example.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 6: Analytical table in an object page with SAP Fiori elements for OData V4.

This capability aims to provide a controlled environment for evaluating SAPUI5 updates in SAP Build Work Zone, thereby avoiding immediate changes in production environments:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-sapui5-version-preview-in-sap-build-work-zone/ba-p/14117996" target="_blank"&gt;Introducing SAPUI5 Version Preview in SAP Build Work Zone&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key users can create consistent text changes with SAPUI5 flexibility. I described this in the context of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-2-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-2508-and-sap/ba-p/14171291" target="_blank"&gt;part 2 of this series&lt;/A&gt; (section &lt;EM&gt;Key Users Can Rearrange ID and Description Within a Field or Column&lt;/EM&gt;).

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hello, Martin Beganyi here again, Program Lead at Procurement Adoption Office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You may know me from my previous contributions as part of the Solution Value Advisory team for EMEA/MEE. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recently, I have transitioned to the newly established Procurement Adoption Office, where I now lead two global adoption programs: one focused on driving the adoption of SAP Ariba’s Category Management solution, and the second dedicated to accelerating the uptake of AI-powered features across SAP Procurement solutions, specifically SAP Fieldglass and SAP Ariba - This blog is dedicated to the latter, the transformative role of &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI in Procurement&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Through years, I’ve observed a consistent challenge: many organizations are unaware of the full suite of AI capabilities embedded in their SAP procurement solutions.&amp;nbsp; Despite the growing availability of these advanced features, adoption remain low or inconsistent, limiting the value customers can unlock.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To address this, we have launched a global program to help customers to adopt AI features in core solutions for example, Strategic Sourcing, Fieldglass, and Buying.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introducing the AI Toolkit&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The cornerstone of our initiative is the AI Toolkit — a concise, easy-to-understand resource that compiles essential information about all available AI functionalities.&amp;nbsp; Designed for those new to AI, the toolkit cuts through the noise of overwhelming information, providing a clear starting point for customers and partners alike.&amp;nbsp; We encourage you to download, share, and leverage this toolkit within your teams:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/pdf/asset/preview/inmn3Zp?ltr=a&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1234612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI in Procurement Toolkit (Oct2025).pdf&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-60px" style="padding-left : 60px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="mbeganyi_0-1758014437892.png" style="width: 164px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315087i29A56ACF0F9A14A4/image-dimensions/164x164?v=v2" width="164" height="164" role="button" title="mbeganyi_0-1758014437892.png" alt="mbeganyi_0-1758014437892.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There are 2 other language variants of the AI Toolkit:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/iLW3eh3?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1252801" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI in Procurement Toolkit (Spanish)&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A title="AI in Procurement Toolkit (Brazilian Portuguese)" href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/7uDxoCb?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1252803" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI in Procurement Toolkit (Brazilian Portuguese)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Should you prefer a solution-focused, high-level perspective, we are pleased to share our latest one-pagers:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/V4YHQfA?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1235339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI One Pager - Guided Buying&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/4FFtbRZ?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1235335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI One Pager - Guided Sourcing&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/ByUHW2F?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1235333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI One Pager - SAP Ariba Category Management&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/dwMtWbB?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1235340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI One Pager - SAP Fieldglass Contingent Workforce - Base AI&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/VopG1uX?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1235341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI One Pager - SAP Fieldglass Contingent Workforce - Premium AI&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/mHAVQqC?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1235342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI One Pager - SAP Fieldglass Services Procurement - Premium AI&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/bMxGdJT?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1236809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI One Pager - Joule in SAP Ariba Solutions&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/bakZYiC?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1236806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI One Pager - Joule in SAP Fieldglass Solutions&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Engage with Our Interactive Learning Opportunities&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To further support adoption, we host a series of live webinars where we delve into the value of individual AI features, demonstrate activation steps, and showcase practical usage scenarios.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1759230466"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has introduced the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAM4U solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;, an excellent tool to gather data from SAP backend systems for the consolidation and analysis of users, engines, and HANA EE license consumption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/partners/skybuffer-as-accelerator-for-sam4u-adoption.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, available on SAP Store, provides extended analytics and simulation capabilities to view SAM4U data from new angles. It empowers customers moving to &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA Private Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;, or already working under an &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP RISE contract&lt;/STRONG&gt; to run different “what if” scenarios based on data extracted from their SAP system, helping them find the best approach to optimize SAP license consumption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1562716961"&gt;What Was Missing?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;While SAM4U provides valuable transparency, customers often asked:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How do I see the potential savings?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How do I define a strategy for optimization?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Where exactly should I focus my cleanup efforts?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;License optimization typically falls into three categories:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fast optimization&lt;/STRONG&gt;: achieved quickly with user data cleanup in SAP backend&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Obtainable optimization&lt;/STRONG&gt;: achievable in reasonable time with cleanup and role/profile tuning&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Maximal optimization&lt;/STRONG&gt;: the long-term goal, achieved when roles and authorizations are precisely aligned with actual usage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;What was missing was &lt;STRONG&gt;clarity and insights&lt;/STRONG&gt; to navigate these paths effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1366203456"&gt;How it is solved&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new release of the &lt;STRONG&gt;Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt; brings two major updates:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clarity through an extremely informative dashboard&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business AI insights powered by the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/partners/skybuffer-as-skybuffer-ai.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Skybuffer AI platform&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, an SAP Business AI certified solution from SAP Store&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1169689951"&gt;The dashboard&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the highlight. The dashboard presents clear KPIs on one page, helping to get insights into current estimated spending and estimated savings, following both fast and obtainable strategies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_01_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309978i54B59334983928A8/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_01_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" alt="Pic_01_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 1 The Dashboard&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the central KPIs is &lt;STRONG&gt;License Optimization Potential&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which shows the estimated current contract costs compared to optimized contract costs. The KPI highlights savings that can be achieved either through the fast users cleanup approach or the obtainable approach of cleaning up users and optimizing roles with the highest optimization potential.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_01_1_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309994i4C22D72241B4C8A4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_01_1_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" alt="Pic_01_1_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 2 License Optimization Potential&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are many other useful insights. For example, it shows how many authorization objects are not used at all. This is a target for maximal optimization and one reason it is not so easily obtainable. The lower the number, the better the authorizations are aligned with active usage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_02_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" style="width: 475px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309979i9708ABB60A81DB97/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_02_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" alt="Pic_02_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 3 Excess Authorization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The evaluation of maximal optimization is also visualized by the &lt;STRONG&gt;FUE Gap KPI&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_03_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" style="width: 475px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309980i84AC61A95B54ECB9/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_03_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" alt="Pic_03_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 4 FUE Gap - Authorization vs Active Usage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is also a very helpful hint about &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP_ALL&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP_NEW&lt;/STRONG&gt; profiles still in use in production:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_04_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" style="width: 477px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309981i3ADB2575976410BF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_04_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" alt="Pic_04_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 5 Users with Sensitive Authorization Profiles&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The total number of roles and profiles that can be optimized and the savings this brings are also clearly summarized:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_05_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" style="width: 481px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309982i5F8822617311D32F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_05_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" alt="Pic_05_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 6 Excess Roles&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-973176446"&gt;The insights&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business AI insights&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the dashboard bring extra clarity and understanding. For example, they show the fast optimization saving potential and provide clear explanations and strategies on how to reach it:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_06_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309985i4D1D589A85F48B1D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_06_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" alt="Pic_06_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 7 Business AI Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI recommendations are also available for obtainable or maximal optimization:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_07_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309987i66E3AFABA2F91D32/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_07_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" alt="Pic_07_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 8 Max and Obtainable Optimization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Effectively, this functions as a personal SAP License Analysis and Optimization consultant, virtualized and trained to understand the organization’s own data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The AI Assistant is always there, and expanding its knowledge base is straightforward through the Skybuffer AI platform. For example, it can present the top 10 roles for optimization or provide additional information related to SAP licensing:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_08_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309988iE68DADFA792DBFBF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_08_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" alt="Pic_08_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 9 Top 10 Roles for Optimization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Of course, all the well-established simulation and analysis tools of the Accelerator remain available. With the new release, they work even better, helping to test and simulate the AI Assistant’s recommendations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-776662941"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt; now provides one of the most powerful toolsets on the market to analyze and optimize SAP users and engines licenses independently. It helps avoid the significant costs of SAP license optimization consulting and delivers deep insights into user and engine data. This comes without the need for a complex SAM4U installation and without spending time and money on consulting services that quickly become outdated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-580149436"&gt;What to do next?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Running SAP under a &lt;STRONG&gt;RISE contract&lt;/STRONG&gt;? Use the dashboard and Business AI insights at least once per month to avoid FUE consumption increases and surprises. Train your team with the solution and the organization will not face unpredictable growth of SAP license consumption. Leave consulting for the exceptional case when the company grows faster than its SAP role set. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;When adopting &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SAM4U&lt;/STRONG&gt;, one of the biggest challenges customers face is handling role, profile, and authorization changes without disrupting production. This is where the &lt;STRONG&gt;Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt; brings real value, thanks to its &lt;STRONG&gt;simulation capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Customers Expect from Authorization Simulation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the simulation, customers get the ability to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Log changes at the &lt;STRONG&gt;role or profile level&lt;/STRONG&gt; on the system dataset.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Track and review roles and profiles that have been modified.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Revert changes at the role or profile level, either all at once or individually.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Modify user-to-role or user-to-profile assignments.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Perform &lt;STRONG&gt;mass unassignments&lt;/STRONG&gt; of roles and profiles (e.g., removing &lt;EM&gt;SAP_ALL&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;SAP_NEW&lt;/EM&gt;).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Identify and review changes made to users.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Revert user assignments back to their original state when needed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_01_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317554i8A3DE036559FED09/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_01_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_01_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 01 Roles and Profiles Changes Tracking&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_02_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317555iCA2DE811D6AE8C89/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_02_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_02_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 02 Roles and Profiles Mass Unassignment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_03_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317556iFCDF5954F9E81B88/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_03_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_03_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 03 Changes to the Role Detailed Review&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But that’s not all! The real power lies in managing &lt;STRONG&gt;simulation snapshots&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_04_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317557i35353604B93F864F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_04_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_04_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 04 Snapshots of Simulations on the System’s Dataset Level&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Simulation Snapshots Matter&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Simulation snapshots are created at the system dataset level, allowing you to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Save changes without applying them directly in production.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create new consolidations from modified datasets.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Avoid repetitive, time-consuming rework when changes cannot be applied immediately.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example: Working with Two Systems in Consolidation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine you are analyzing two systems in a consolidation project. You make changes to roles and users in both systems. However, due to restrictions, you cannot yet apply changes in &lt;STRONG&gt;System A&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Without losing your work, you can:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a new consolidation using the dataset from System A and the modified snapshot from System B.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Or temporarily move the snapshot from System A into the dataset, and later reapply those changes when they are ready for production.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_05_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317558i6212A14A1613138A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_05_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_05_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic. 05 The Power of Management Snapshots and Datasets that are Used in Consolidation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This flexibility ensures you never have to redo your work and can manage changes efficiently.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Customers Prefer the Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customers appreciate the simulation feature because it provides:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System-level flexibility&lt;/STRONG&gt; to manage changes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Easy-to-handle snapshots that can be created, reviewed, reverted, and reused.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No duplication of effort, once a change is made, it is saved and can be reapplied.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reliable validation, you can reload fresh production data and check if changes were successfully implemented.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If changes were tracked only at the consolidation level, fresh data from the system would overwrite them. This is why the Accelerator focuses on &lt;STRONG&gt;system snapshots&lt;/STRONG&gt;, giving customers full control to experiment, validate, and roll back whenever needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_06_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/317559i7B381AA062ADA23C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_06_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" alt="Pic_06_Accelerator_for_SAM4U_Adoption_Blog05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pic.06 Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption Dashboard for Simulation Results Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the &lt;STRONG&gt;Accelerator for SAM4U Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;, simulation becomes not just a test environment, but a &lt;STRONG&gt;strategic tool for efficient and risk-free SAM4U adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Header.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/322072i5B1C4FF52755F523/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5Tips_WebUIKit_Header.png" alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Header.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="mailto:https://www.figma.com/community/file/1494295794601744471" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fiori for Web UI Kit&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; is your go-to resource for creating consistent, efficient, and accessible user interfaces. The kit helps you design faster without starting from scratch.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here are five helpful tips to get started and design with confidence:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1890905964"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. Explore the full component library first&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before jumping into design work, begin with the&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; design foundations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; separately, such as color, typography, and shadows. Understanding these basics early on will help you make better, more consistent decisions throughout your work. You’ll also find &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP icons&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;product illustrations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; integrated directly into the kit.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content01.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/322078iB8978EBBC8FF8391/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content01.png" alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content01.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once you're familiar with the foundations, take time to explore the full set of components included in the file. The UI kit provides a wide range of ready-made elements, scalable and fully aligned with SAP’s design principles, all in one place.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1694392459"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; 2.&amp;nbsp;Use variables to switch between themes easily&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the SAP Fiori for Web UI Kit, variables control core style properties such as colors, typography, and spacing.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The kit includes support for multiple themes that reflect SAP’s visual language in different environments. The default light theme is called &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Morning Horizon&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, and for low-light settings, the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Evening Horizon&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; theme provides a dark mode alternative.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content02.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/322069i2C6CF2201FE6BB30/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content02.png" alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content02.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Using variables, you can switch between these themes easily within your Figma file. This lets you preview how your designs will look across different user preferences without rebuilding components from scratch.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1497878954"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Use the Slot for content placement&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Some components, such as Dialogs or Cards, include a Slot&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;a clearly marked area (highlighted in orange) where you can insert your own content, like text, icons, or buttons, while keeping the original structure and behavior intact.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To use it, simply select the Slot layer in the component and replace it with your own content using the &lt;STRONG&gt;“Swap instance”&lt;/STRONG&gt; option in the right-hand panel. There’s no need to detach the component, your changes will stay consistent and maintain the design integrity.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content03.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/322070iBFB622F8BACC8071/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content03.png" alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content03.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Using the Slot keeps your designs flexible, editable, and easy to maintain.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1301365449"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Keep your file organized and use naming conventions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Maintaining a well-organized file helps you and your team navigate and manage designs efficiently. Use &lt;STRONG&gt;clear naming conventions&lt;/STRONG&gt; for frames, components, and layers so it’s easy to find and update elements later. This practice saves time and reduces errors, especially as your designs grow in complexity.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content04.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/322071i669EF16CE856E273/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content04.png" alt="5Tips_WebUIKit_Content04.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1104851944"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Stay in sync with releases&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP Fiori for Web UI Kit is actively maintained and regularly improved with new components, updates, and refinements based on user feedback. To stay up to date, keep an eye on official announcements and communications from the SAP Design team.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can find the&lt;STRONG&gt; latest releases&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;and enhancements&lt;/STRONG&gt; on our SAP Design System Portal &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/design-system/fiori-design-web/v1-136/discover/whats-new?external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“What’s New” page&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP Fiori for Web UI Kit gives you more than a set of components, it provides a solid foundation for building enterprise-ready designs that scale.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fiori continues to advance its technological offerings with the release of SAP BTP SDK version 25.8, featuring exciting updates for both Android and iOS. This release introduces a suite of new capabilities as well as upgrades to current features, enhancing user experiences on business apps.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1761042173"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New in SAP Fiori for Android 25.8&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the following section, we’ll give you a brief overview about everything that’s new in SAP Fiori for Android 25.8.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1693611387"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Circular In-Place Progress Indicator&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The circular in-place progress indicator displays the status of ongoing processes when loading is initiated by a button. An indicator within the button shows the loading state.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Fresh Look and a Smoother Experience for All Users&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are excited to announce the introduction of the Horizon themes in SAP Analytics Cloud a modern, cohesive visual language aligned across SAP’s product suite. You will have access to Morning and Evening Horizon, the light and dark themes as well as to the high contrast white and black themes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SAC Home Page in Horizon Morning.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321160i2CA8FED2158D5072/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SAC Home Page in Horizon Morning.png" alt="SAC Home Page in Horizon Morning.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This release also brings a series of improvements to the side navigation, user profile, user settings, and the search, making it easier than ever to find insights and personalize your application.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1632673325"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1436159820"&gt;Horizon Themes: Modern, Accessible, and Unified&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The introduction of Horizon themes marks the next step in our user experience journey. These themes feature clean lines, contemporary color palettes, and improved contrasts, resulting in visually appealing UI that remain comfortable for extended work sessions. Accessibility is at the heart of Horizon, with thoughtful color selections and focus indicators for every user. The experience remains consistent as you move between SAP Analytics Cloud and other SAP solutions, offering a unified interface that supports productivity and ease of use. Personalize your experience by choosing from light, dark, and high contrast theme variants—simply head to your user settings to select your preferred look.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Theme Change in User Settings.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321188i1D3D6AA0FD2262C8/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Theme Change in User Settings.png" alt="Theme Change in User Settings.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Belize theme will remain the default in Q4 and continue to be available for the next few quarters. Looking ahead, Horizon will become the standard theme in the first half of 2026. If you’d like to enable Horizon for your organization sooner, simply navigate to the administration section under default appearance to set Horizon as your tenant’s default theme.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1239646315"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1043132810"&gt;Improved User Profile and Settings&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The user profile and settings have been reimagined to put key information and settings at your fingertips. Instantly access your account details, profile image, and settings in one clear and organized dialog. Additionally, the “About” section is now conveniently located within your user profile making key information more accessible whenever you need it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="About Section in the User Profile.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321166iF39EB95D9E5B9969/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="About Section in the User Profile.png" alt="About Section in the User Profile.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-846619305"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-650105800"&gt;Simplified and Adaptive Side Navigation&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The redesigned side navigation bar logically organizes content and tools for easy access. Collapsible sections expand your workspace, and in collapsed view, hovering over each symbol shows module names to help you quickly find what you need.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-453592295"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-257078790"&gt;More Convenient Search&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The search now features autocomplete, making it noticeably more convenient and user-friendly. As you begin typing, relevant suggestions appear instantly, streamlining the process of finding models, stories, and files. This enhancement helps you locate what you need more efficiently, even if you can’t recall exact names, ensuring a smoother search experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These updates are based on user feedback and extensive research, reflecting SAP’s commitment to delivering an analytics platform that is powerful, accessible, and a pleasure to use. The Horizon themes and experience enhancements aim to reduce friction, promote creativity, and empower you to shape insights in a visually appealing and highly functional space.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-60565285"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--135948220"&gt;What's Next&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can continue to style your SAP Analytics Cloud Stories independently, &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/d385f41f9f6343eba6ed87eeeb50650b.html?q=theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;as the story theme mechanism will remain unchanged and won't follow the overall SAC theme.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the Q1 2026 release, we plan to update the preferences for new stories and make the Horizon Morning theme available in every story; &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/horizon-theme-and-templates-for-stories-in-sap-analytics-cloud/ba-p/13657027" target="_blank"&gt;both Morning and Evening Horizon themes are currently available on GitHub.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new Horizon themes and user experience improvements will be available mid-November in the Q4 2025 SAP Analytics Cloud release.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have feedback on the Horizon themes or the planned story theme updates, please reach out to me by message or in the comments.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Thanks to the ASUG Dallas chapter for helping us reach new audiences with SAP Fiori Innovation Day Dallas. We had a dedicated track within the larger ASUG event in which participants could learn about the latest user experience innovations, build an SAP Fiori elements app in less than 90 minutes, and see some sneak previews of AI-powered functionality that we’re working on. They also asked our sponsors questions during a panel discussion and found many useful tips they could use back in the office.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="PeterSpielvogel_0-1761007050538.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/329989i8841FEEBC98D637A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PeterSpielvogel_0-1761007050538.png" alt="PeterSpielvogel_0-1761007050538.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the keynote, ASUG CEO, Geoff Scott, made a compelling case that moving to the cloud is a prerequisite for innovation at speed. In his interactive session, he polled the audience to give people a sense of how they compare to their peers in terms of innovation and adoption of various technologies. Many companies were using AI in some capacity, and some rely on multiple AI tools. &amp;nbsp;It was interesting to see what use cases the attendees find most relevant.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="PeterSpielvogel_1-1761007050544.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/329988iE81C15D3D44DB7EF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PeterSpielvogel_1-1761007050544.jpeg" alt="PeterSpielvogel_1-1761007050544.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;ASUG found that automation and analytics are the top AI use cases. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the UX Strategy and What’s New section, Ioannis and Ute talked about the continuing evolution of SAP Fiori, how &lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/fiori-elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Fiori elements&lt;/A&gt; brings the Fiori design system to apps in SAP S/4HANA, and demoed the Fiori experience in SAP Cloud ERP. They showed new AI-powered capabilities in My Home, such as &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/tyBYABf?ltr=a&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1227640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Recap&lt;/A&gt; and recommendations, and explained how AI built into the SAP Fiori elements framework powers &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/UWBaJpb?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1165618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;easy filter&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/nCKuxVH?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1166391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;smart summarization&lt;/A&gt;, and &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/V2V6rwq?ltr=v&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1166518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;error explanation&lt;/A&gt;. All of this functionality combines to make business users more productive by making it faster and easier to find the apps and data they need in their S/4HANA system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="PeterSpielvogel_2-1761007050545.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/329987i26529AB309FE2835/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="PeterSpielvogel_2-1761007050545.png" alt="PeterSpielvogel_2-1761007050545.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;We had a day full of learning and fun.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the partner panel, experts from &lt;A href="https://mygoconsulting.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Mygo Consulting&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://www.qubittron.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Qubittron&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://www.mindsetconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Mindset Consulting&lt;/A&gt;, and &lt;A href="https://www.cbs-consulting.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;cbs Corporate Business Solutions&lt;/A&gt; shared their expertise on:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How organizations measure the return on investment for UX and AI projects.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Where AI playing a role in UX and how agents fit into the picture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The relative value of AI for business users and developers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The top AI use cases that make sense for companies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Where to focus your efforts in the near term to gain benefits from AI&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks to Sujeeth, Sidhartha, Andy, and Bastian for your unique insights and actionable advice. I found it interesting that many of the topics that people mentioned would be useful in the future were already part of our “one more thing” session at the end of the day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The hands-on workshop focused on using AI to accelerate the process of building SAP Fiori apps. Participants used AI in three main ways:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Gathering user requirements in a business requirement documents or via sketching&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/from-idea-to-app-using-ai-powered-project-accelerator-to-develop-sap-fiori/ba-p/14095300" target="_blank"&gt;Uploading the resulting document into SAP Fiori tools AI to generate an SAP Fiori elements app&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Making further updates and refinements to the application&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;We used &lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/fiori-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Fiori tools&lt;/A&gt; extensively. This is a logical choice since they are built into &lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/business-application-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Application Studio&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The final session of the day (and highest rated) was our lab preview / sneak peak at a few projects are currently in development. As with any discussion of future functionality, we made it clear that these demos might or might not turn into actual products. With this in mind, Sebastian and Katja showed:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Vibe coding&lt;/STRONG&gt; using MCP servers. (Vibe coding was also part of the ASUG keynote, so this is clearly becoming a mainstream topic, at least among software developers.)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;App Finder&lt;/STRONG&gt; to make it easier to find information in your S/4HANA system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/AfZ3KfF?ltr=v&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1224347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Easy Fill&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which speeds up data entry by extracting content from an email or other text and using it to update the relevant fields in an app built using an SAP Fiori elements object page.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Smart Helpers&lt;/STRONG&gt; to make it easier to get your work done in SAP. I’m being deliberately vague here as we’ll share more at SAP TechEd and its companion roadshows in early November 2025.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Thanks to everyone who made SAP Fiori Innovation Day a success&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Presenters (in order of appearance): Ioannis Grammatikakis, Ute Oemler, Sebastian Steinhauer, Katja Zoch&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Fiori Innovation Day sponsors: &lt;A href="https://www.cbs-consulting.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;cbs Corporate Business Solutions&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://www.mindsetconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Mindset Consulting&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://www.qubittron.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Qubittron&lt;/A&gt;, and &lt;A href="https://mygoconsulting.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Mygo Consulting&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ASUG events team: Nicole Kern, Kara Hughes&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ASUG volunteers: Heather Davis, Simon To&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Behind the scenes team: all the developers, architects, product managers and other colleagues who built the functionality and set up the demos and hands-on systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All the customers: we appreciate your questions, which help us understand your priorities and focus our development resources.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Next steps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://tinyurl.com/elementsroundtable" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Register for the monthly SAP Fiori development roundtable&lt;/A&gt; call to meet other developers and architects who build SAP Fiori apps.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/nl/sap-fiori-development-newsletter/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Subscribe to the SAP Fiori development newsletter&lt;/A&gt;, in which we share updates on SAP Fiori elements, SAP Fiori tools, SAPUI5, and SAP Build Code every other month.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Explore the SAP Fiori Development Portal&lt;/A&gt; to see how SAP Fiori elements can boost developer productivity, drive UX consistency, and ensure your apps have the enterprise readiness features your users expect.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Join us at &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;TechEd Berlin&lt;/A&gt; or &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/virtual/flow/sap/tev25/catalog-virtual/page/catalog?tab.sessionplanned=1692641568884001cZ9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;virtual&lt;/A&gt; or at the next &lt;A href="https://events.sap.com/eur-fiori-innovation-day-walldorf-2025/en_us/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Fiori Innovation Day in Walldorf&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Colleagues could spend the following two hours from 10am till lunch to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;visit the five booths dedicated to research topics in the Business Suite UX organization plus a chance to catch up with colleagues &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;in their own time over coffee and some snacks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We were very impressed to see over 150 colleagues from many different areas of SAP with a great interest in user experience and user research stepping by and enjoying the friendly and productive atmosphere.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Our booths: Five User Research projects for Business Suite UX&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 17.01.01.png" style="width: 773px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/329922i6C5B6C3357DFB5C3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 17.01.01.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 17.01.01.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Booth 1: &lt;STRONG&gt;GenUI – Welcome to an app-free world!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Showcased how dynamically created and personalized SAP user interface can look like.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Booth 2:&amp;nbsp; &lt;STRONG&gt;Your AI-Powered Research Partner&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Presented a prototype of an AI-powered assistant designed to scale user research learning and planning.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Booth 3: &lt;STRONG&gt;A Day in a Life of a Billing Clerk&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Demonstrated research objectives that aim to deeply understand user challenges with real-world billing workflows.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Booth 4: &lt;STRONG&gt;The Behavioural Analytics Edge&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Presented how to decode user behaviour and design delightful experiences with behavioural analytics.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Booth 5: &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Focused on the SAP Business Suite strategy, how we co-innovate with customers and how to get access to usage and experience data across the Suite.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="UX_Loves_2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/330130i96ED8E0CD92D296A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="UX_Loves_2.png" alt="UX_Loves_2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;From insights to im&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;pact&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What we say about the role of user research in product development also applies to the event: It is so important to meet in one room, bring in an open mind, and have the time to exchange in a diverse group.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We started these UX Loves Innovation – events in our coffee corner in Walldorf in 2024 as an opportunity for colleagues to meet each other in person, understand what other teams are currently working on and have an exchange across different areas.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is such a joy to see how this event developed to a recurring series with more and more colleagues contributing and joining each time. This is a great chance to bring great topics and great people together and we would encourage you to try out your own local version of "UX loves Innovations” yourselves wherever you are in the world.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP has some amazing innovations and ideas that can improve the experience that our customers have today and giving us inspiration and information on how they experiences will evolve in the future. We want to make it simple for our colleagues to have a chance to learn and share in a positive and uplifting environment, and we hope they will also bring their topics for booths for future events as well!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;As an administrator managing user access in SAP for Me is a critical part of maintaining system security and operational efficiency. Whether you're onboarding new users as an admin, or adjusting access for existing ones, knowing how to properly assign and revoke authorization packages is essential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#33CCCC"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why This Matters?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Authorization packages define what an S-user ID can access within the SAP for Me ecosystem—from support cases to license data, viewing systems, software download, etc. Keeping these permissions up to date ensures compliance, prevents unauthorized access, and streamlines user roles across your organization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Steps:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Log in to &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt; using your S-user ID and password.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;In the SAP for Me homepage, click on “&lt;STRONG&gt;Users &amp;amp; Contacts&lt;/STRONG&gt;” tab under Dashboard at the left side of your screen.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Then, click on “&lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Users &amp;amp; Authorization&lt;/STRONG&gt;” card. Or simply go to &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/userscontacts/usermanagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;User Management&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Under the list of users, find the S-user ID to unassign the authorization package from. Or simply use the search field to search&amp;nbsp;for the specific S-user ID and click on the magnifying glass to search.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Ron8_6-1761146380594.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/331119iA3BC1FC48DBE25F4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Ron8_6-1761146380594.png" alt="Ron8_6-1761146380594.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click on the user/S-user ID (not the checkbox).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click on the &lt;STRONG&gt;EXISTING AUTHORIZATION PACKAGES&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click the &lt;STRONG&gt;Edit&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Pencil) icon on the top right of that section.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Ron8_7-1761146501375.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/331120iF4151BA334B89A42/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Ron8_7-1761146501375.png" alt="Ron8_7-1761146501375.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click on the checkbox in front of the Authorization Package(s) to be removed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click &lt;STRONG&gt;OK&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Ron8_9-1761146591627.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/331122iC85DE99FB4527FA1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Ron8_9-1761146591627.png" alt="Ron8_9-1761146591627.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click &lt;STRONG&gt;Save&lt;/STRONG&gt; on the top right of the EXISTING AUTHORIZATION PACKAGES section.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Ron8_11-1761146718297.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/331125iD0C952516C6F927E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Ron8_11-1761146718297.png" alt="Ron8_11-1761146718297.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more details, please refer to Knowledge Base Article: &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2878696/E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2878696 - How to unassign an Authorization Package from an S-user ID - SAP for Me&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#33CCCC"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Got More Questions? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/contact-us.html?anchorId=section_42886245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Customer Interaction Center&lt;/A&gt; is always ready to support you with any of the listed processes and is happy to assist with questions regarding case-related matters, SAP for Me navigation, S-user ID, or SAP Universal ID.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alternatively, please feel free to ask us in the Q&amp;amp;A   &lt;A href="https://answers.sap.com/tags/cae17fd6-917e-483d-881a-502155cade3c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;All Questions in Customer Experience | SAP Community&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://answers.sap.com/tags/564272146051092002342823452713708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;All Questions in Support Services | SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#33CCCC"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Don't Miss Out on Free Webcasts &amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Ron8_0-1761227359824.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/331671i2C1192DD15D3D297/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Ron8_0-1761227359824.png" alt="Ron8_0-1761227359824.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We would like to invite you to our free webcasts, which we believe can help you get the best from your support in SAP.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA 2025 comes with a whole host of user experience innovations and improvements. &amp;nbsp;Web access via My Home and the SAP Fiori launchpad has many useful improvements, as does SAP Mobile Start for mobile access. Joule gives conversational access to Private Cloud Edition using natural language, now also with analytical insights. There are additional collaboration capabilities, and many improvements in details: some towards providing a more consistent and integrated SAP Business Suite, some simply making a user’s life easier. Finally, design and UI technology is also advancing, with powerful AI support for developers now available.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This post covers:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UX Updates for Consistent and Integrated Business Suite&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Web access: My Home and SAP Fiori launchpad&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Mobile access: SAP Mobile Start&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Situation Handling news&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-Assisted capabilities: outlook&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New collaboration capabilities&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UX improvements in details&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UI adaptation improvements for key users&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Design and Technology news&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you want to get an impression of how good SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, looks across all the main product areas, have a look at the online &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana-private-edition/product-tour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Product Tour&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since this post covers what’s new, building on the previous 2023 release, you might want to have a look at the UX innovations which came with the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/8308e6d301d54584a33cd04a9861bc52/4e8cdcc8cbaf4b909217bda9965b7db4.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Feature Pack Stacks&lt;/A&gt; 00, 01 and 02 of the 2023 release:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-update-what-s-new-for-sap-s-4hana-2023-private-cloud/ba-p/13578447" target="_blank"&gt;SAP User Experience Update: What’s New for SAP S/4HANA 2023 (Private Cloud and On-Premise)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/user-experience-advances-with-sap-s-4hana-2023-fps01-private-cloud-and-on/ba-p/13634354" target="_blank"&gt;User Experience Advances with SAP S/4HANA 2023 FPS01 (Private Cloud and On-Premise)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q4-2024-news-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-2023/ba-p/13894277" target="_blank"&gt;SAP User Experience Q4/2024 News for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2023&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For a full overview of what’s new since the FPS00 shipment of the 2023 release, have a look at the documentation (note that it includes features from the above 2023 FPS01 and FPS02 blog posts, as well as this one):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/whats-new/5fc51e30e2744f168642e26e0c1d9be1?Business_Area=ABAP+Platform&amp;amp;q=Fiori+Launchpad&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What’s New for SAP Fiori launchpad for SAP S/4HANA and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1634733921"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UX Updates for Consistent and Integrated Business Suite&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We aim to provide a consistent and integrated experience for all users of the SAP Business Suite, which means providing an entry point for users to access all the various SAP products within the suite, and ensuring that the user experience across these products is consistent, making it easy for users to use applications from different products.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567303135"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Entry Points&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 1 shows our approach for providing a web and a native mobile entry point to the products of the suite, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud. I’d like to highlight that Joule can also be seen as an entry point to access the entire suite, since our goal is to provide Joule wherever you are, be it in our web applications or native mobile apps. Using Joule, our goal is to allow users to query and perform actions on all the products and applications which they are authorized to use, simply using natural language. As you’ll see below, we are making good progress towards this goal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: Entry points providing an integrated workplace for accessing the SAP Business Suite.

Since these capabilities also apply to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition as well as SAP S/4HANA (except for SAP Start), I will not repeat them here, but rather refer you to them:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q1-2025-update-part-1-many-new-innovations-available-ai/ba-p/14012822" target="_blank"&gt;SAP User Experience Q1/2025 Update – Part 1: Many New Innovations Available (AI, Joule and More)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What we will look at in this post in detail are UX innovations for local access from web or mobile, via My Home and the SAP Fiori launchpad, and via SAP Mobile Start. Each has a dedicated section further below.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174276125"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Design Updates for Suite Consistency&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To achieve consistency across the suite, we have made design improvements which are relevant for a consistent user experience across the entire SAP Business Suite, and which are now available with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2025 and SAP S/4HANA 2025. As I mentioned in my April blog post &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/upcoming-design-updates-for-the-sap-business-suite-sap-fiori-for-web/ba-p/14083427" target="_blank"&gt;Upcoming Design Updates for the SAP Business Suite (SAP Fiori for Web)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, consistency of the user experience across the various applications used by a user is an important part of overall usability, helping users to feel confident and at ease when using a suite of products – no unexpected surprises.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this section, we’ll look at four design updates provided by the SAP Fiori launchpad, as well as examples of the new design for illustrations:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigation menu: Side navigation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Updated shell bar&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Updated user menu&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Updated notifications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;New illustrations design&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1106845339"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigation Menu: Side Navigation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many SAP products already offer a navigation menu on the left of the screen, a pattern already familiar to many people. Hence, we have decided to apply that approach to navigation across the SAP Business Suite in upcoming releases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA, the side navigation is displayed as an overlay, as you can see in Figure 2. It gives you direct access to your favorite apps, either directly or via the folders you have created. It also gives you direct access to your Spaces and Pages. The previously available menu to access all your spaces and pages along with personalization options is available via the entry “All Spaces” at the bottom of the menu.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A big benefit of this new navigation menu is that you can now access your favorite apps directly from any application. Previously, you would have to return to My Home and then click on your favorite app, now you can access it directly from the menu, as shown in Figure 2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 2: The new navigation menu, opened up from the new shell bar, showing direct access to Favourite Apps, My Spaces and All Spaces.

The immediately visible difference is that now the product name is displayed to the right of the SAP Logo, in this case “S/4HANA Cloud” as you can see at the top of Figure 2. The logo and the name are all contained within a clickable area, which brings the user to the start page (e.g. My Home).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The new shell bar enables the next two design updates to the user menu and to notifications&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By default, after upgrading, the old shell bar will be shown, with the new navigation menu. We advise that you check any test automation and RPA (Robotic Process Automation) you may have before switching on the new shell bar, since you may need to make some adjustments – in particular if you log off at the end of a test.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can switch on the new shell bar via the Activate New Features application, with the feature “/UI2/SHELL_BAR_TOGGLE”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-713818329"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Updated User Menu&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new user menu design shown in Figure 3 provides more space for the avatar of the user, and provides more space between items for easier selection. The settings are always at the top as the first entry, and the “Sign Out” option is separated from the actual navigation options in the list, to make it easier to find.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3: Updated design of user menu and notifications.

Often, this requires some key information about the item, for example the name of the product and the value for a purchase requisition. These details are now visualized directly in the task cards, as you can see in Figure 5, making the workflow more efficient.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;To-Dos&lt;/EM&gt; now also shows custom Situations, created using the extended Situation Handling framework, in addition to the standard situations delivered by SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--540494070"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intelligent Homepage Experience&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another useful new feature is AI recommendations for applications: as you can see in Figure 5 in the Apps section of My Home, a new tab &lt;EM&gt;Recommended&lt;/EM&gt; has been introduced which uses AI to create a list of applications which are recommended to the user to add to their Favorites.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To help users get started with My Home, we provide intelligent generation of pre-delivered cards, so that when they first log on, the &lt;EM&gt;Insights Cards&lt;/EM&gt; section is not blank, but rather has a number of pre-delivered cards relevant to the user’s role.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--443604568"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage News Application&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m glad to announce that administrators can now easily create their own news to be displayed on My Home, using the new Manage News application. Figure 6 shows the start page of the application, listing news articles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can specify title, subtitle and main text, a background image, the start and end dates for publishing, as well as categorizing and targeting the news for specific groups of users. Also, you can mark a news article as being “Critical”, so that it is highlighted accordingly. You can see an example in Figure 5.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 6: Manage News application.

It also controls navigation between apps, as well as settings such as which theme to apply. Here are some additional improvements with the 2025 release.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1130034585"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Automatic high-contrast and dark-mode detection, also for custom themes&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Users can define on their front-end device’s operating system whether applications should appear in a light mode or a dark mode, or a high-contrast mode. Now these settings are taken into account also for custom themes, in addition to SAP visual themes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technically this is done by the launchpad supporting theme sets, which is a group of themes of the same family with different flavors – such as the Horizon theme, with a light and dark version along with high contrast black and high contrast white versions. Customers can create their own theme sets using the UI theme designer.

This can lead to a page being defined in such a way that certain users are not authorized to use any of the apps therein; similarly, a space can end up not having any pages available to a user. Now, if this happens, any such empty pages or spaces are hidden from the user, rather than being shown empty.

The editable ones were listed in the tab “Customer-Created”, the others in the tab “Predefined”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our customers gave us feedback that this was in fact confusing, because a page which was listed as “Customer-Created” in a non-productive tenant and which was transferred to a productive tenant became “Predefined” there, i.e. it was not listed under “Customer-Created” despite it being customer-created.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, the design has been changed, with two tabs for editable entities (spaces or pages) and non-editable ones. For example, in the app “Manage Launchpad Pages”, the tabs are called “Pages” and “Page Templates”, as shown in Figure 8. No matter what tenant you are in, you cannot change or edit page templates, you can only use them to create new pages. The same applies to spaces in the Manage Launchpad Spaces app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 8: The redesigned app Manage Launchpad Pages with Tabs for “Pages” and “Page Templates”.

This can be helpful if a specific group of users need different settings, for example if you want to gradually introduce Spaces and Pages, you no longer have to switch it on for all users.

This means that the overall experience you have using SAP goes up a level, since you can get a lot done much more easily than before.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule Agents can be triggered from Joule directly or embedded within applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For a general overview of Joule Agents, have a look here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Agents&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; on sap.com.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/ai-agents-in-action/ba-p/14073817" target="_blank"&gt;AI Agents in Action&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; (blog post).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/envision-the-future-of-generative-ai-with-sap-s-ai-agents/ba-p/14029219" target="_blank"&gt;Envision the Future of Generative AI with SAP's AI Agents&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; (blog post).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/how-sap-s-ai-agent-architecture-enables-unprecedented-automation-and/ba-p/14158296" target="_blank"&gt;How SAP’s AI Agent Architecture Enables Unprecedented Automation and Decision Augmentation&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;(blog post by Philipp Herzig).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--38677498"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Intelligent Situation Handling news&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/topics/intelligent-situation-handling" target="_blank"&gt;Intelligent Situation Handling&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;speeds up the resolution of critical business situations by automatically and hence proactively alerting users about urgent issues, proposing follow-up actions, letting you monitor situations, and automating the resolution by using business rules.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you’re not familiar with Intelligent Situation Handling, I recommend that you watch the introductory video and read the “Get started” blog posts on the SAP Community topic page:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/intelligent-situation-handling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Intelligent Situation Handling topic page&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the 2025 release, SAP provides nine new situation templates in the areas of finance, public sector, service, sourcing and procurement, and supply chain:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/f5d3e1005efd4e86acf9a65abf428082/0dd53d53b6654cdab30b71d95d966c0f.html?version=2025.000&amp;amp;locale=en-US&amp;amp;parentHref=https://help.sap.com/whats-new/5fc51e30e2744f168642e26e0c1d9be1?locale=en-US%26q=situation&amp;amp;parentName=What%27s+New+Viewer+-+SAP+S/4HANA+and+SAP+S/4HANA+Cloud+Private+Edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;New use cases for Situation Handling&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For the full list of available templates provided by SAP, look here:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/8308e6d301d54584a33cd04a9861bc52/fdbf5eabf0e84621a15c6965b3e01649.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Use Cases for Situation Handling&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--528594010"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New Situation Handling Framework Capabilities&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Already with the 2023 release we made it possible for partners and customers to create their own situation objects with ABAP Development Tooling (ADT) via developer extensibility. This becomes even more powerful with the 2025 release, with the extended framework supporting the collection of data context, support for custom objects in your own use cases, and support for the standard translation option. Let’s have a look at these in a bit more detail.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1018510522"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Data Context supported by the Extended Framework &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The data context is business data from business objects involved in a situation instance that can be collected, distributed, and used for advanced analytics – for example using the &lt;EM&gt;Monitor Situations – Extended&lt;/EM&gt; app. If enabled in a situation type, data context is collected when a situation instance is created, updated, or completed. For example, If you use the situation template&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/8308e6d301d54584a33cd04a9861bc52/f1a8c585e3ca4132b3ae595fde3ee58b.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;state=PRODUCTION&amp;amp;version=2025.000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Quantity Deficit in Supplier's Delivery&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;to inform specific members in your purchasing organization about a deficit in the quantity of materials to be delivered by the supplier, you'll get, for example, the material, plant, or supplier as part of the data context.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the 2025 release, every extended object-based situation template supports data context. You can activate it in the &lt;EM&gt;Manage Situation Types - Extended&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;app. Doing so results in an event being triggered that includes the data context every time a situation instance is created, updated or completed.

This means that more than one user can edit a business object, such as a payment advice, at the same time, and see changes made by others before the object is finally saved. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Within the object page, the object header shows the avatars of those who are editing; you also get the avatar shown next to fields which they are editing. Also, we have extended the grid table to indicate which entries are currently in a draft state, as well as showing those currently being edited by someone else (see Figure 16); this is also available in the responsive tables.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can invite other users to join you in working on an object, as you can also see in Figure 16.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 16: Collaborative draft.

We continue to work on these details, which can often result in higher satisfaction for users. With the 2025 release, we bring you a large number of improvements, as outlined in the following subsections.

(Note that the table settings dialog allows you to define filters on all the fields in the table, irrespective of which fields appear in the filter bar at the top of the screen).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I’m pleased to say that, on request of many users, we now provide the option to define filters on date fields for the “Last X days/weeks/months/… to date” as well as the “Next X days/weeks/months/… to date”, where users can specify the number “X”.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;An example of how tricky such seemingly simple things can be: if, on December 11th, you choose “Last 2 months to date”, do you mean the period from November 1st to December 11th, which would be up to the current date but not a full two months, or do you mean “the last two full months”, i.e. October 1st to November 30th? Since both make sense, the selection screen gives users the option to choose, with the default being the “full month” case, described as “exclude current period”, as you can see in Figure 20.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 20: New option for semantic date range.

With the 2508 release we provide information about available keyboard shortcuts directly where you need them, in the context of the application. By selecting “Keyboard Shortcuts” in the user menu, a new window appears explaining all the available shortcuts for the application area currently in focus. If you click on a different part of the application, or navigate somewhere else, then the window showing the available shortcuts is updated immediately for the new context.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 23 shows an example for &lt;EM&gt;Manage Journal Entries&lt;/EM&gt;, where the focus is currently on the filter bar.

These changes could be made by other users, or by automated background processing . An example for the latter is the Traceability Results application, which is now automatically updated if a batch run has created new traceability items.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note that this only supported by applications built with SAP Fiori elements using OData V4.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-958524588"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Improved performance for scrolling in grid tables&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our engineers have done some magic so that now scrolling is very fast in grid tables, which are the table type typically used for working with large volumes of data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why do I call it magic? Well, modern web-based UIs have the UI layer running in the browser, managing direct user interactions, and calling services in the backend to get and update data. However, if you are working with a list of say over 100,000 items, you would have to wait quite a long time when starting the application until all items have been loaded into the browser. Hence we only load a certain number to start with, such as 100. This however means that when a user scrolls beyond the 100 which have been loaded, additional data needs to be fetched from the backend, which slows down scrolling. Now, our engineers have found a way to minimize this effect to almost zero, so that you have fast scrolling all the time – magic!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 25: Performance improvement for scrolling in grid tables. Alt Text: a short video showing scrolling through a grid table." style="width: 895px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334672i7C39F7BFC8877273/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="25 Scrolling grid table (Manage Journal Entries).gif" alt="Figure 25: Performance improvement for scrolling in grid tables.

Alt Text: a short video showing scrolling through a grid table.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whenever the threshold is reached and more data needs to be loaded, there is a very short delay, with the progress indicator being shown for a few milliseconds, as you can see in Figure 25. In most cases, this is completely negligible. Nevertheless, we do also provide customers the option to change the number of entries loaded by default when the application is started. This is useful if a customer knows that, for a certain application, the number of entries will not exceed 2.000 for example. Then they can set the threshold to 2.000, which means that the application will take a little bit longer to load first time around, but then scrolling will be instantaneous for all the data. Figure 26 shows the UI for doing this, as part of UI adaptation. The “Threshold” determines the maximum number of entries loaded when the application is started, the “Scroll Threshold” determines the maximum number that are loaded during scrolling if new entries need to be fetched.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 26: UI adaptation to determine the threshold determining the maximum number of entries loaded in a table when an application is started.

This information is also stored when saving a view of a table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-565497578"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sort or Group Tables by ID or Description &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Fiori apps display the ID and the description in the same column within a table, which provides a better experience than having them in two separate columns.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, we offer users a choice when sorting or grouping the table by a column which contains both ID and description: they can choose to do this by ID or by description. As you can see in Figure 27, this selection is very intuitive. The example shows what it looks like when sorting by Company Code. At the bottom of the table you see an entry “1710 (BestRun US)”, where the Company Code (the ID) is 1710 and the Company Name (the Description) is “BestRun US”. In the popover “Sort By” section, the row of icons next to Company Code and Company Name indicate that currently no sorting is active, with the option to sort either bei Code or by Name ascending or descending.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 27: Sort or group tables by ID (in this case Company Code) or by Description (Company Name) when both are displayed together in one column .

Until now, when users personalize the table, both the ID and the description were listed in the list of columns, which confused some users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, we have addressed this by providing the option to hide the descriptions (see Figure 28), and hence simplifying personalization. This option is on by default, i.e. the description fields are automatically hidden now.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 28: Description fields can be hidden from the list of fields shown when personalizing tables.

The “Adapt UI” option which key users see in their user menu shows you what you can change in the app, in a very intuitive way. And you can change and adapt far more than in the past. See below for some highlights.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Also good to know: the Adapt UI menu entry is also available when using a Classic app (SAP GUI for HTML) from within the SAP Fiori launchpad. It will bring up the Adapt UI app for Screen Personas&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F5740')/S35" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;F5740 Adapt UI for Classic Applications with Screen Personas&lt;/A&gt;, which allows key users to adapt the layout of these classic UIs. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--24042937"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Users Can Rearrange ID and Description Within a Field or Column&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP applications come with a standard arrangement of ID and description within a field or a column, based on user research. We have found that for financial users, it is usually best to have the ID first and the description in brackets: Company Code (Company Description), for example “1710 (BestRun US)” as shown in Figure 27. For users in sales and logistics, it is usually best to have the name first and the ID in brackets: for example Customer Name (Customer ID), for example “US Specialty Cycles 5 (USCU_S05)” as shown in Figure 2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, key users can use UI adaptation to rearrange the order for a given application. Doing this change applies then to all occurrences of the field in the application, i.e. the filter bar, the table or in a form on an object page.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--513959449"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Far More Options for Key Users to Adapt UIs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key users can now make far more significant changes to UIs than before.

In addition, I would like to explicitly mention some particular highlights here from the above posts too. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regarding extensibility: do have a look at the new &lt;A href="https://extensibilityexplorer.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/ExtensibilityExplorer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP Extensibility Explorer&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--445399761"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Design System Portal and UI Kits – now with AI Components&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We recently introduced the new &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.sap.com/design-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Design System portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; that brings together the product design guidelines SAP Fiori for web, SAP Fiori for iOS, and SAP Fiori for Android, as well as to the new digital design system guidelines. With its enhanced usability, simplified versioning and improved performance, designers (and developers!) get a better user experience compared with the previous SAP Fiori design guidelines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new UI Kits available for designers in Figma make it easy for designers to design accessible UIs at enterprise scale, for web applications, mobile iOS and Android applications as well as wearables. The UI Kits provide reusable components for web and mobile, along with web floorplans, which give you what you need out-of-the-box.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have just released SAP Web UI Kit v8.0 which includes a full set of &lt;STRONG&gt;AI&amp;nbsp;components&lt;/STRONG&gt;: AI Button, AI Menu Button, AI Split Menu Button, AI Prompt Input, AI Input, AI Text Area, and AI Rich Text Editor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 30: The SAP Design System portal start page (on the left), and SAP’s UI Kits for designers in Figma (on the right).

It is designed to help developers maximize the benefits of SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, which &lt;SPAN&gt;is more than just a UI framework: it’s a metadata-driven approach that leverages the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/design/design-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Design System&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;as its guiding principle, incorporating the most relevant design system options for typical business tasks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 31: The SAP Fiori development portal.

They provide standardized layouts and interaction patterns, ensuring UI consistency and boosting developer productivity. The great advantage of using building blocks is that you can use them to create a customer layout and yet still benefit from the advantages of the metadata driven approach: low code, built in enterprise-grade capabilities such as multi-language support, accessibility, security and performance, and design system consistency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find out more in this six-part series of blog posts, here is the first one, which contains links to the others:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-the-sap-fiori-development-portal-your-gateway-to-rapid-sap/ba-p/14236768" target="_blank"&gt;Introducing the SAP Fiori Development Portal: Your Gateway to Rapid SAP Fiori App Creation (1 of 6)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--838426771"&gt;Using AI to Develop UIs&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The above posts from &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q1-2025-update-part-7-ui-design-and-technology-for-web/ba-p/14034290" target="_self"&gt;Q1/2025&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-7-ui-design-and-technology-for-web-and-mobile/ba-p/14197128" target="_self"&gt;Q3/2025&lt;/A&gt; introduced a number of powerful ways to accelerate UI development by using AI, such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creating SAP Fiori elements apps from a sketch (in the Q1 post), now integrated in SAP Build Code and Joule (Q3 post)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule for SAPUI5 freestyle development (Q1 post)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted auto-fix of coding errors with UI5 linter (Q3 post)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recently, we have gone even further and introduced MCP servers for freestyle SAPUI5 development as well as for developing with SAP Fiori elements and the associated building blocks. These&lt;SPAN&gt; open-source&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;servers provide AI agents with comprehensive UI5 and SAP Fiori elements knowledge, including best practices and project-aware context information, and thus provide developers with valuable support.

Adopting the latest standards gives applications a true cutting edge, ensuring that solutions are inclusive and meet the diverse needs of users globally.&amp;nbsp;When creating apps with SAP Build and SAPUI5, developers can leverage the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, two of the key new requirements in the 2.2 version are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The minimum target size of an interactive element now needs to be 24x24 px, so that users don’t accidentally activate a neighbouring element.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Each operation that can be performed by dragging can also be performed alternatively without dragging – so that people who cannot use a mouse to drag can still use the UI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;See more details:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sapui5-is-leading-the-way-in-accessibility-with-wcag-2-2/ba-p/14101596" target="_blank"&gt;SAPUI5 is Leading the Way in Accessibility with WCAG 2.2&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1231453781"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Blue Crystal and Belize Themes No Longer Available in the Web&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As announced in April (&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/upcoming-removal-of-sap-fiori-themes-belize-and-blue-crystal/ba-p/14063111" target="_blank"&gt;Upcoming Removal of SAP Fiori Themes Belize and Blue Crystal&lt;/A&gt;), the visual themes Blue Crystal and Belize have been removed from our web UI technology with the 2025 release of SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition and SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;After upgrading, existing usages of Belize or Blue Crystal will be automatically redirected to the Horizon theme&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;If you have created your own custom theme based on Belize or Blue Crystal using the UI theme designer, you will need to migrate this to an available theme.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Our strong recommendation is to base the new version on the Horizon theme.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information about the web UI technologies affected, and how to migrate custom themes, have a look at this blog post:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/announcement-removal-of-belize-theme-of-sap-fiori/ba-p/14061924" target="_blank"&gt;Announcement: Removal of Belize theme of SAP Fiori&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note that SAP GUI for Windows continues to support older themes, including Blue Crystal and Belize.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1134564279"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Final words&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Come join us at &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/germany/events/teched.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;TechEd 2025&lt;/A&gt;, November 4 - 6, either virtually or in Berlin, or at one of the TechEd On The Road events in Louisville (USA), Bangalore (India) and Sydney (Australia), to find out more about our latest user experience innovations.
