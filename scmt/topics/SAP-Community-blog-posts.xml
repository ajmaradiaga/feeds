    <content>&lt;P&gt;November arrived, and just like someone marking their favorite series on the calendar, attending SAP Inside Track Barcelona became an unmissable event. Eight years and counting! What started as a simple gathering has evolved into a tradition where the global SAP community connects to exchange knowledge, fresh ideas, and engage in discussions fueled by shared passion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This year, I marked the date in bold and with an asterisk to ensure I was there from the very first coffee (that one which tastes even better when shared with long-lost friends).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SIT Barcelona is not merely an event; it’s that time of the year when we learn from the best, rekindle old friendships, and speculate on the future of SAP. Without further ado, here’s an overview of this edition and the sessions that made us reflect, laugh, and even reconsider our strategies. Let’s dive in!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SITBarcelona Opening&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We kicked off the event with David Ruiz welcoming us once again to the event.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="IMG_5147.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/197687i087AFB576108D99C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="IMG_5147.JPG" alt="IMG_5147.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5012"&gt;@AAncos&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Antonio de Ancos Cid | SAP 2024: From A to Z&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If there was one session marked with a red circle in my agenda, it was Antonio de Ancos' session. Why? First, because of my admiration for such a great professional, and second, for the way he shares his knowledge on social media. Anyone following him knows that he always manages to keep us updated with the latest SAP news, all with his unique touch that makes learning a pleasure. And the best part? All in Spanish, of course! An inspiration for many of us!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This time was no exception: Antonio not only shared his knowledge but invited us to actively participate in his presentation with a fun icebreaker game from the very start. The game? A SAP version of Pasapalabra, where each question led us to explore concepts, trends, and novelties within the ecosystem. It was a very fun time where, amid laughter and answers (some more accurate than others), we went through new features, curiosities, and technical details. A unique way to learn and connect with the community!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antonio Leite | Knowledge Graphs with SAP Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Antonio introduced us to the fascinating world of Knowledge Graphs. He explained how a Knowledge Graph represents knowledge through nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), resembling the function of our own brains. Antonio didn’t stop at just the theory. He described a four-step process for building a Knowledge Graph within SAP and presented concrete examples of its use in solutions like SAP Integration Advisor and SAP Intelligent Situation Automation. In short, he demonstrated how SAP is integrating Knowledge Graphs into its ecosystem to create a smarter and more connected environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/62541"&gt;@Josetxu&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Josetxu Fernández | Gen AI in SAP Data and Analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Josetxu explained how SAP is integrating AI into its analytical tools, especially in SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC). They developed Just Ask, a new SAC feature that allows users to make queries in natural language. Instead of building complex queries with technical terms, users can simply ask questions like "show me the order value by product." Just Ask uses large language models (LLMs) to understand user intent and generate the corresponding query, also suggesting the most appropriate visualization for the data. A video showed practical examples of how to generate visualizations, filter data, and create low-code dashboards using Just Ask.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The architecture of Just Ask was also described, emphasizing that SAP’s LLM model is trained with internal data and does not use customer information, ensuring privacy. The evolution of Just Ask was presented, including future integration with SAP Data Sphere, support for new languages, and collaboration with Joule for a more complete user experience. This collaboration with Joule will enable easier dashboard creation with a low-code approach, the ability to generate scripts to customize dashboard behavior (e.g., creating buttons with specific actions), and the option to interact with data conversationally, like a chatbot.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This initiative aims to make data analysis accessible to a broader audience, regardless of their technical expertise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fran Villegas | Get Business Insights from Your SAP Data with Natural Language and Develop Gen AI Solutions Integrating AWS and SAP BTP Services&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this session led by Fran Villegas – Iberia Senior SAP Specialist SA at AWS – he provided a brief introduction to the relationship between AWS services and SAP, before discussing AWS’s Gen AI services and how they can be used with SAP. He also demonstrated integrations, including with SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The relationship between AWS and SAP began in 2008, when SAP started using AWS for its initial developments; it was the first certified cloud platform for SAP infrastructure. Early adopters migrated systems to the cloud, resulting in automation solutions from AWS partners to implement SAP services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;He introduced AWS Bedrock, a key tool that connects SAP to advanced language models via APIs. Notably, it allows customization with customer-specific data, ensuring privacy by keeping information within AWS accounts. The Bedrock-SAP integration enhances functionalities like natural language SQL generation and data-driven decision-making based on structured HANA Cloud data. Furthermore, services like QuickSight improve analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The event demonstrations provided a practical approach to exploring the integration capabilities between AWS and SAP BTP. One of the workshops focused on developing a chatbot using AWS Bedrock, integrating data from SAP HANA Cloud. In this context, Bedrock facilitated the generation of SQL commands based on natural language. A demo on data flows included extracting data from SAP to QuickSight for analysis. These workshops also highlighted the flexibility in training AI models using SageMaker.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Coffee Break&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Just when the much-awaited first break arrived to recharge with coffee and a sandwich or croissant, Lluís took the stage to surprise us. He showed the SIT Barcelona logo, a representation of the city's skyline, which led to an entertaining activity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On X, they launched a challenge: guess as many monuments from the skyline as possible. Of course, I couldn’t resist participating, and although I was just one step away from guessing them all, luck was on my side! After revealing the logo and announcing the winner, Lluís shared the great news: I had won the monument contest! That said, the first monument in the skyline remains a mystery… Was it a pixel poorly cut? An abstract work of art? Who knows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The important part is that I won my first prize of the day. A big thank you for that fun moment and the prize!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Mistery-monument.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/197694i33F6765CC44831A0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Mistery-monument.png" alt="Mistery-monument.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Alejandro Rodriguez Barea | SAP BTP Chef: The First SAP Demo Where All BTP Pillars Are Shown in a Practical Business Case&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alejandro focused on an innovative demonstration by the SAP Solution Advisory BTP team in Spain, where they showcased an app called BTP Chef, highlighting all the capabilities of SAP BTP working together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The BTP Chef app integrates the five pillars of SAP BTP. Here’s a brief explanation of each pillar and how the app uses them:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Application Development: Both vendors and customers interact with the app through interfaces created with SAP Build Apps, enabling no-code user interface creation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automation: The workflow, from when the customer places an order to when it’s received, is managed with SAP Build Process Automation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integration: SAP Integration Suite connects different applications and systems, including non-SAP data systems, by exposing APIs and applying security policies, ensuring smooth and secure data flow.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data and Analytics: SAP Analytics Cloud is used to monitor daily operations, creating a dashboard with key insights on orders, available ingredients, and other relevant metrics for decision-making.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Artificial Intelligence: Customer feedback analysis is carried out using the generative AI hub, accessible via SAP AI Launchpad and AI Core. The system categorizes feedback, suggests personalized responses, and even generates concise summaries to manage customer experience effectively.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The session emphasized that BTP isn’t just a collection of independent tools but a cohesive platform where each component complements others to create integrated solutions. It was definitely one of the sessions I recommend if you get the chance to see it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Felipe Borges | Global eCompliance with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this session, a general overview of electronic compliance, electronic invoicing, and the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC) solution was provided, focusing on combating tax evasion. It was highlighted that many countries, especially in Europe, are adopting an authorization model where transactions are reported to tax authorities in real time. This model, supported by solutions like SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC), aims to close the tax evasion gap by validating electronic invoices at the time of the transaction. SAP’s DRC solution allows extracting data from SAP S/4HANA, transforming it into the required format for each country, and sending it to the corresponding tax authority. The session also included specific examples from Germany and Italy, countries that have implemented or are in the process of implementing mandatory electronic invoicing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/13173"&gt;@tse-gdo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Gregory Doukas | Technician Training Tool Powered by Apple Vision Pro and SAP S/4 HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once again, Gregory Doukas amazed us with his technical solution for an aviation company, combining SAP BTP with Apple Vision Pro. This solution leverages the power of Apple Vision Pro to simulate interaction with a real-scale airplane engine. Technicians can move around the virtual engine, using tools and following step-by-step instructions to complete maintenance tasks. The application monitors their progress, tracks the time spent, and certifies that the training has been completed. On the SAP side, a side-by-side extension application of SAP CAP on SAP BTP manages training data and compliance. The architecture also uses HANA Cloud for data storage and event-driven SDI data replication to keep information synchronized, with a RAG model and GPT-based AI interaction. This innovative solution not only enhances training efficiency but also reduces the risks and costs associated with using physical machinery for practice. Additionally, the immersive experience and AI assistance help technicians better understand procedures and acquire the necessary skills to perform their jobs with greater precision and safety. Looking forward to seeing what new innovations he will present next year.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Maria Codinach | Harsh Kumar | Frit Ravich’s Success Case in the Modernization of the Sales Application: From SMP to In-house Middleware&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This session focused on the modernization of Frit Ravich’s Frit Sales application. The company transitioned from using SAP’s mobile platform, which had scalability and performance limitations, to a custom middleware solution based on Spring Boot. This change allowed Frit Ravich to handle large volumes of data and transactions, improving user experience and sales team efficiency. Integration with SAP ERP was maintained through a new gateway, ensuring synchronization of key data like orders, products, and customers. The new architecture, supported by tools such as Grafana and Nagios, offers greater flexibility, scalability, and real-time monitoring.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lunch Break&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;During the lunch break at SAP Inside Track Barcelona, we had the opportunity to catch up with old colleagues, friends, and professionals from the SAP world. It was one of those moments where conversations flow between bites: we shared anecdotes, discussed the talks we had attended, how they fit into the current SAP landscape, and even ventured predictions about what the future holds for this ever-evolving ecosystem. It was a real pleasure to chat with such great professionals. There was even time for some laughs!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Niranjan Gattupalli | Implementing gCTS for Continuous Delivery in Complex SAP S/4HANA Landscapes: Branching Models, Hotfix Strategies, and 5-Tier Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Niranjan’s talk focused on gCTS, a tool that combines SAP’s traditional change transport system with Git version control. gCTS offers advantages such as version control, branching, and merging code, facilitating the management of parallel versions and continuous delivery. However, it also presents challenges, such as limitations in working with feature branches and a lack of native protection against version degradation. Despite these challenges, gCTS offers greater flexibility in change management, especially in environments with multiple systems. Niranjan proposed a model for environments with limited resources, where a single system manages maintenance versions and urgent fixes, highlighting the importance of collaboration in overcoming gCTS implementation challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antonio Valladares Fernandez | Integration Suite Addon Built in SAP CAP by Code10&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CI Accelerator, presented by Antonio Valladares, is a suite of tools designed to optimize and simplify integration projects in SAP Integration Suite. It combines methodologies, an add-on with additional functionalities, and intuitive applications to accelerate cloud adoption, ensure the quality and governance of integrations, and enhance the user experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The applications, developed with SAP CAP and UI5, allow seamless integration management, value mapping, and certifications. CI Accelerator also integrates with SAP's pipeline concept, facilitating the creation and management of complex workflows in a structured manner. In summary, CI Accelerator is a comprehensive solution that drives efficiency and satisfaction in integration projects with SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/298"&gt;@Bernhard&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Bernhard Luecke | Reinventing Support with AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bernhard Luecke, the Global Head of Support Sales &amp;amp; Procure at SAP, shared insights on how SAP is leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to transform customer support. With an impressive two million cases managed annually, AI emerges as a key tool to optimize efficiency and enhance the experience for both users and the support team.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most notable aspects is using AI to provide intelligent recommendations for KBAs and notes. SAP is developing a system that utilizes AI to recommend the most appropriate communication channel based on the urgency and complexity of the issue. For cloud products, SAP plans to integrate direct access to support within the applications, making the support experience more seamless and intuitive. The ultimate goal is to use AI to predict issues and notify customers before they occur. This would involve analyzing customers' cloud systems, identifying potential risks, and offering preventive solutions to avoid impacting users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before kicking off the anticipated CodeJam led by Antonio Maradiaga, SAP Inside Track Barcelona gave us one of those exciting moments (with a bit of nervousness): the raffles! Books and a €100 SAP store gift card were up for grabs. As usual, the classic raffle tool was used, where names disappear one by one until a winner remains. The first draw started, and, as the anxious person I am, I searched for my name among the survivors. There it was! As fewer names remained, the adrenaline was rising: would I be the one? And yes, the last name standing was mine. My second prize of the day! It was epic. Then, with a big smile, we kicked off the CodeJam.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Ganadores1.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/197695iBA7134DC9F2E5A6F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Ganadores1.png" alt="Ganadores1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/107"&gt;@ajmaradiaga&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; - Antonio Maradiaga | CODEJAM | SAP Build Code – Generative AI-Powered Development with Joule Copilot (including SAP Build Code and SAP Build Apps)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This year’s CodeJam was an epic experience! Led by Antonio Maradiaga, whom I had the pleasure of finally meeting in person (a true inspiration and the one responsible for motivating me to sign up for Devtoberfest!), the CodeJam took us through SAP Build Code with Joule AI, demonstrating how this tool powers AI-based development. The scenario simulated a customer loyalty program, integrating data on purchases, redemptions, and products from SAP S/4HANA Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This CodeJam not only showcased the power of low-code/no-code in a SAP environment but also demonstrated how artificial intelligence can accelerate the creation of business solutions. It was a moment of learning, creativity, and fun, highlighting the impact of these technologies on the future of development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="IMG_5150.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/197696i1936582DE5DE838C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="IMG_5150.JPG" alt="IMG_5150.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To wrap up, I want to say that it was an unforgettable day, where I was able to reconnect with old colleagues, meet new ones, and, of course, share insights with great professionals. I also want to thank the impeccable organization. Each year they manage to outdo themselves, and this time was no exception. My sincere thanks to &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/182"&gt;@david_ruizb&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/733"&gt;@Lluis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/44"&gt;@enric101&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, Imma, Mireia, and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for their effort and dedication. See you next year; I’m already counting the days for the next edition!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Asistentes.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/197697i7ADF05D0D8B4225B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Asistentes.png" alt="Asistentes.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm attaching the YouTube links for the sessions of SAP Inside Track Barcelona 2024:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Part 1 - &lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A4ZsBO96Nk&amp;amp;t=4584s&amp;amp;ab_channel=SAPInsideTrackBarcelona" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SIT Barcelona 2024 online - 22 nov 2024 - 8.40 to 11.00 (CET)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Part 2 - &lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qZcCA8qpWc&amp;amp;ab_channel=SAPInsideTrackBarcelona" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sit Barcelona 2024 online - 22 nov - 11.30 to 13.30 (CET)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Part 3 - &lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk-7V4ejIHg&amp;amp;ab_channel=SAPInsideTrackBarcelona" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SIT Barcelona 2024 online - 22 nov 2024 - 14:30 to 16.30 (CET)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Version en Castellano.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Noviembre llegó y, como quien marca en el calendario su serie favorita, la cita con el SAP Inside Track Barcelona era ineludible. ¡Ocho años y contando! Este evento, más que un simple encuentro, se ha convertido en una tradición donde la comunidad SAP, tanto local como global, se da un baño de conocimientos, ideas frescas y esas charlas que solo nacen entre apasionados por el mismo tema.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Este año no me lo pensé dos veces: marqué la fecha con negrita y asterisco para estar allí desde el primer café (ese que sabe mejor cuando lo compartes con amigos que hace tiempo no veías).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;El SIT Barcelona no es solo un evento; es ese rincón del año donde aprendemos de los mejores, revivimos viejas amistades y, por supuesto, especulamos sobre lo que se avecina en el universo SAP. Así que, sin más preámbulos, te cuento cómo se vivió esta edición y las sesiones que nos hicieron reflexionar, reír y hasta replantearnos nuestras estrategias. ¡Allá vamos!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SITBarcelona Opening&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Empezamos el evento con&amp;nbsp; David Ruiz dándonos la bienvenida un año más al evento.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antonio de Ancos Cid | SAP 2024: de la A a la Z&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Si hay una sesión que estaba marcada en mi agenda con un círculo rojo, esa era la de Antonio de Ancos. ¿Por qué? Primero de todo por la admiración ante un gran profesional, y segundo por como comparte su conocimiento en redes sociales, quien lo sigue en redes sabe que siempre encuentra la forma de mantenernos actualizados con las últimas novedades del mundo SAP, todo con ese toque único que hace que aprender sea un placer. ¿Y lo mejor? Todo en español, claro. ¡una fuente de inspiración para muchos de nosotros!.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Esta vez no fue la excepción: Antonio no solo compartió su conocimiento, sino que nos invitó a ser parte activa de su presentación con un juego que rompió el hielo desde el minuto uno. ¿El elegido? Un Pasapalabra versión SAP, donde cada pregunta nos llevaba a explorar conceptos, tendencias y novedades del ecosistema. Fue un rato divertidísimo donde, entre risas y respuestas (algunas más acertadas que otras), recorrimos novedades, curiosidades y detalles técnicos. ¡Una forma única de aprender y conectar con la comunidad.!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antonio Leite | Knowledge Graphs with SAP Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nos introduce al fascinante mundo del &lt;EM&gt;Knowledge Graph&lt;/EM&gt;. Antonio nos explica cómo el &lt;EM&gt;Knowledge Graph&lt;/EM&gt; representa el conocimiento a través de nodos (entidades) y aristas (relaciones), asemejándose al funcionamiento de nuestro propio cerebro. Antonio no se queda solo en la teoría. Describio un proceso de cuatro pasos para construir un &lt;EM&gt;Knowledge Graph&lt;/EM&gt; dentro de SAP y presento ejemplos concretos de su uso en soluciones como &lt;EM&gt;SAP Integration Advisor&lt;/EM&gt; y &lt;EM&gt;SAP Intelligent Situation Automation&lt;/EM&gt;. En resumen, nos muestra cómo SAP está integrando el &lt;EM&gt;Knowledge Graph&lt;/EM&gt; en su ecosistema para crear un entorno más inteligente y conectado.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Josetxu Fernández | Gen AI in SAP Data and Analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Josetxu nos explicó cómo SAP está integrando la IA en sus herramientas analíticas, especialmente en SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC). Para eso crearon Just Ask, una nueva funcionalidad de SAC que permite a los usuarios realizar consultas en lenguaje natural. En lugar de tener que construir consultas complejas con nombres técnicos, los usuarios pueden simplemente formular preguntas como "muéstrame el valor de los pedidos por producto". Just Ask utiliza modelos de lenguaje extensos (LLM) para comprender la intención del usuario y generar la consulta correspondiente, además de sugerir la visualización más adecuada para los datos. Se muestra un video con ejemplos prácticos de cómo generar visualizaciones, filtrar datos y crear dashboards con low-code utilizando &lt;EM&gt;Just Ask&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Se describe la arquitectura de &lt;EM&gt;Just Ask&lt;/EM&gt;, haciendo hincapié en que el modelo de lenguaje (LLM) de SAP se entrena con datos internos y no utiliza información de los clientes, garantizando la privacidad de los mismos. Se describe la evolución de &lt;EM&gt;Just Ask&lt;/EM&gt;, incluyendo la futura integración con SAP Data Sphere, el soporte para nuevos idiomas y la unión con &lt;EM&gt;Joule&lt;/EM&gt; para una experiencia de usuario más completa. En esta unión con Joule se conseguirá, creación de dashboards de forma más sencilla, utilizando un enfoque de low-code, el poder generar scripts para personalizar el comportamiento de los dashboards, por ejemplo, para crear botones con acciones específicas y por último, interactuar con los datos de forma conversacional, similar a un chatbot.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Con esto se busca hacer que el análisis de datos sea accesible a un público más amplio, sin importar su nivel de experiencia técnica.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fran Villegas | Get business insights from your SAP data with Natural Language and Develop Gen AI solutions integrating AWS and SAP BTP Services&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;En esta sesión dirigida por Fran Villegas - Iberia Senior SAP Specialist SA en AWS, Nos hace una pequeña introducción sobre la relación de los servicios de AWS con SAP, para despues hablarnos de los servicios de Gen AI de AWS y como los podemos utilizar con SAP y nos enseñó unas demostraciones, una con una integración con SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;La pequeña introducción de la relación de AWS con SAP nos habla de que la relación comenzó en 2008, cuando SAP empezó a utilizar AWS para sus desarrollos iniciales; fue la primera plataforma en la nube certificada para la infraestructura de SAP. Los primeros en adoptarla migraron los sistemas a la nube, lo que dio lugar a soluciones de automatización de los socios de AWS para implementar los servicios de SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nos presentó AWS Bedrock, una herramienta clave que conecta SAP con modelos de lenguaje avanzados mediante API. Destaca por permitir personalización con datos específicos del cliente, asegurando privacidad al mantener la información en cuentas de AWS. La integración Bedrock-SAP potencia funciones como generación de SQL en lenguaje natural y decisiones basadas en datos estructurados de HANA Cloud. Además, servicios como QuickSight mejoran el análisis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;La parte de las demostraciones mostradas en el evento proporcionaron un enfoque práctico para explorar las capacidades de integración entre AWS y SAP BTP. Uno de los talleres destacó el desarrollo de un chatbot utilizando AWS Bedrock, integrando datos de SAP HANA Cloud. En este contexto, Bedrock facilitó la generación de comandos SQL basados en lenguaje natural. Además, se presentó una demo de flujo de datos que incluyó extracción de datos desde SAP hacia QuickSight para análisis. Estos talleres también enfatizaron la flexibilidad en el entrenamiento de modelos de IA usando SageMaker.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Coffee Break.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Justo cuando llegó el esperado primer parón para recargar energías con un café y algún que otro bocata o cruasán, apareció en el escenario Lluís para sorprendernos. Mostró el logo del SIT Barcelona, una representación del skyline de la ciudad que dio pie a una dinámica bastante entretenida.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;En X lanzaron un desafío: adivinar la mayor cantidad de monumentos del skyline. Por supuesto, no pude resistirme a participar y, aunque me quedé a un paso de acertar todos, ¡la suerte estuvo de mi lado! Después de revelar el logo y anunciar al ganador, Lluís me dio la gran noticia: ¡había ganado el concurso de los monumentos! Eso sí, el primer monumento del skyline sigue siendo un misterio… ¿Un pixel mal recortado? ¿Una obra de arte abstracta? Quién sabe.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Lo importante es que me llevé mi primer premio del día. ¡Muchísimas gracias por ese momento tan divertido y por el premio!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Alejandro Rodriguez Barea | SAP BTP Chef: first SAP demo where all the pillars of BTP are shown in a practical business case.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Se centró en una demostración innovadora realizada por el equipo de SAP Solution advisory BTP de España, donde nos mostró una aplicación llamada BTP Chef para mostrar todas las capacidades de SAP BTP trabajando juntas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;La aplicación BTP Chef integra los cinco pilares de SAP BTP, aquí dejo una breve explicación de cada pilar y de cómo los utiliza la aplicación:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Application Development: Tanto los proveedores como los clientes interactúan con la aplicación a través de interfaces creadas con SAP Build Apps. Lo que permite la creación de interfaces de usuario sin código.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automation: El flujo de trabajo, desde que el cliente realiza un pedido hasta que lo recibe, se gestiona con SAP Build Process Automation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integration: SAP Integration Suite conecta las diferentes aplicaciones y sistemas, incluido un sistema de datos no SAP, exponiendo API y aplicando políticas de seguridad. Lo que garantiza un flujo de datos fluido y seguro.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data and Analytics: Para monitorizar las operaciones diarias del chef, se utiliza SAP Analytics Cloud para construir un panel de control. Este panel proporciona información clave sobre los pedidos, los ingredientes disponibles y otras métricas relevantes para la toma de decisiones.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Artificial Intelligence: El análisis de los comentarios de los clientes se realiza utilizando el centro de IA generativa, accesible a través de SAP AI Launchpad y AI Core. El sistema es capaz de categorizar los comentarios, sugerir respuestas personalizadas e incluso generar resúmenes concisos para facilitar la gestión de la experiencia del cliente&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;La charla enfatiza que BTP no se trata solo de un conjunto de herramientas independientes, sino de una plataforma cohesiva donde cada componente se complementa para crear soluciones integrales. Para mi es una de las sesiones que recomiendo si podéis ver.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Felipe Borges | Global eCompliance with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;En esta sesión se proporciona descripción general del cumplimiento electrónico, la facturación electrónica y la solución de SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC), y como combatir la evasión fiscal. Se destacó que muchos países, especialmente en Europa, están adoptando un modelo de autorización donde las transacciones se reportan a las autoridades fiscales en tiempo real. Este modelo, apoyado por soluciones como SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (DRC), busca cerrar la brecha de la evasión fiscal al validar las facturas electrónicas en el momento de la transacción. La solución DRC de SAP permite extraer datos de SAP S/4 HANA, transformarlos al formato requerido por cada país y enviarlos a la autoridad fiscal correspondiente. La charla también mencionó ejemplos específicos de Alemania e Italia, países que han implementado o están en proceso de implementar la facturación electrónica obligatoria&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Gregory Doukas | Technician Training Tool powered by Apple Vision Pro and SAP S/4 HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Un año más Gregory Doukas nos sorprendió con su solución técnica para una empresa de aviación que combinaba SAP BTP y las Apple Vision Pro. El caso aprovecha la potencia de Apple Vision Pro para simular la interacción con un motor de avión a escala real. Los técnicos pueden moverse alrededor del motor virtual, utilizando herramientas y siguiendo instrucciones paso a paso para completar las tareas de mantenimiento. La aplicación monitoriza su progreso, el tiempo que tardan y, finalmente, certifica que han completado el entrenamiento. En el lado de SAP, una aplicación de extensión lado a lado de SAP CAP en SAP BTP gestiona los datos de capacitación y el cumplimiento. La arquitectura también utiliza HANA Cloud para el almacenamiento de datos y la replicación de datos SDI impulsada por eventos para mantener la información sincronizada y un modelo RAG&amp;nbsp; con chat GPT para la interacción de IA. Esta solución innovadora no solo mejora la eficiencia de la capacitación, sino que también reduce los riesgos y los costes asociados al uso de maquinaria física para la práctica. Además, la experiencia inmersiva y la asistencia de la IA ayudan a los técnicos a comprender mejor los procedimientos y a adquirir las habilidades necesarias para realizar su trabajo con mayor precisión y seguridad. Con ganas del ver que novedad nos presenta el año que viene.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Maria Codinach | Harsh Kumar | Frit Ravich's success case in the modernization of the sales application: from SMP to in-house middleware&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;La charla se enfocó en la modernización de la aplicación Frit Sales de la empresa Frit Ravich's. Se pasó de utilizar la plataforma móvil de SAP, que presentaba limitaciones de escalabilidad y rendimiento, a un middleware propio basado en Spring Boot. Este cambio permitió a Fre-Rabic manejar un gran volumen de datos y transacciones, mejorando la experiencia del usuario y la eficiencia del equipo de ventas. La integración con el sistema SAP ERP se mantuvo a través de un nuevo gateway, asegurando la sincronización de datos clave como pedidos, productos y clientes. La nueva arquitectura, apoyada por herramientas como Grafana y Nagios, proporciona una mayor flexibilidad, escalabilidad y monitorización en tiempo real.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lunch Break&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Durante el descanso para comer en el SAP Inside Track de Barcelona, tuvimos la oportunidad de compartir un rato genial con antiguos compañeros, amigos y profesionales del mundo SAP. Fue ese tipo de momento en el que, entre un bocado y otro, las conversaciones fluyen: compartimos anécdotas, discutimos las charlas que habíamos presenciado y cómo encajan en el panorama actual de SAP, y hasta nos atrevimos a hacer predicciones sobre lo que nos espera en el futuro de este ecosistema que no deja de evolucionar. Un verdadero placer compartir charlas con grandes profesionales. ¡Hasta hubo tiempo para unas risas!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Niranjan Gattupalli | Implementing gCTS for Continuous Delivery in Complex SAP S/4HANA Landscapes: Branching Models, Hotfix Strategies, and 5-Tier Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;La charla de Nanjan se centra en gCTS, una herramienta que combina el sistema tradicional de transporte de cambios de SAP con el control de versiones de Git. gCTS ofrece ventajas como el control de versiones, la ramificación y la fusión de código, facilitando la gestión de versiones paralelas y la entrega continua. Sin embargo, también presenta desafíos como la limitación en el trabajo con ramas de funciones y la falta de protección nativa contra la degradación de versiones. A pesar de estos desafíos, gCTS permite una mayor flexibilidad en la gestión de cambios, especialmente en entornos con múltiples sistemas. Nanjan propone un modelo para entornos con recursos limitados, donde un único sistema gestiona versiones de mantenimiento y correcciones urgentes, y destaca la importancia de la colaboración para superar los retos de la implementación de gCTS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antonio Valladares Fernandez | Integration Suite addon build in SAP CAP by Code10&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CI Accelerator, presentado por Antonio Vades, es una suite de herramientas diseñada para optimizar y simplificar los proyectos de integración en SAP Integration Suite. Combina metodologías, un add-on con funcionalidades adicionales y aplicaciones intuitivas para acelerar la adopción de la nube, garantizar la calidad y gobernanza de las integraciones, y mejorar la experiencia del usuario.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Las aplicaciones, desarrolladas con SAP CAP y UI5, permiten una gestión fluida de integraciones, mapeos de valores y certificados. Además, CI Accelerator se integra con el concepto de pipeline de SAP, facilitando la creación y gestión de flujos complejos de manera estructurada. En resumen, CI Accelerator es una solución integral que impulsa la eficiencia y la satisfacción en los proyectos de integración con SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bernhard Luecke | Reinventing Support with AI.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Bernard Luecke que es el Global Head of Support Sales &amp;amp; Procure at SAP nos habló sobre cómo SAP está aprovechando la inteligencia artificial (IA) para transformar la manera en que se brinda soporte a los clientes. Ante la impresionante cantidad de dos millones de casos que SAP gestiona anualmente, la IA emerge como una herramienta clave para optimizar la eficiencia y la experiencia tanto para los usuarios como para el equipo de soporte.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Uno de los aspectos más destacables es el uso de la IA para proporcionar recomendaciones inteligentes de KBAs y notas a los usuarios. SAP está trabajando en un sistema que utiliza la IA para recomendar el canal de comunicación más adecuado según la urgencia y complejidad del problema. Para los productos en la nube, SAP planea integrar el acceso al soporte directamente en las aplicaciones. De esta manera, el usuario podrá acceder a la ayuda sin tener que salir de la aplicación en la que está trabajando, haciendo que la experiencia de soporte sea mucho más fluida e intuitiva. El objetivo final de SAP es utilizar la IA para predecir problemas y notificar a los clientes antes de que estos se produzcan. Esto implicaría analizar los sistemas de los clientes en la nube y detectar posibles riesgos, ofreciendo soluciones preventivas para evitar que el problema llegue a afectar al usuario.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Antes de arrancar con el esperado CodeJam liderado por Antonio Maradiaga, el SAP Inside Track Barcelona nos regaló uno de esos momentos llenos de emoción (y un poco de nervios): ¡los sorteos! Libros y una tarjeta de 100 euros en la tienda SAP estaban en juego. Como es tradición, se usó la mítica herramienta de sorteos del SIT, donde los nombres desaparecen uno a uno hasta quedar un ganador.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;El primer sorteo empezó y, como buen ansioso, busqué mi nombre entre los sobrevivientes. ¡Ahí estaba! Cada vez quedábamos menos, y la adrenalina subía: ¿seré yo? Y sí, el último nombre en pie fue el mío. ¡Mi segundo premio del día! Fue épico. Luego, con la sonrisa bien puesta, arrancamos el CodeJam.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antonio Maradiaga | CODEJAM | SAP Build Code – Generative AI-powered development with Joule copilot (include SAP Build Code and SAP Build Apps)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;¡El CodeJam de este año fue toda una experiencia épica! Liderado por Antonio Maradiaga, a quien por fin tuve el gusto de conocer en persona (¡un crack y también el culpable y un referente que me inspiró a inscribirme en el Devtoberfest!), El CodeJam nos llevó a explorar SAP Build Code junto con Joule AI, mostrando cómo esta herramienta potencia el desarrollo basado en inteligencia artificial. El escenario propuesto simulaba un programa de fidelización de clientes, integrando datos relacionados con compras, canjes y productos desde SAP S/4HANA Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Este codejam no solo mostró el poder del low-code/no-code en un entorno SAP, sino que demostró cómo la inteligencia artificial puede acelerar la creación de soluciones empresariales. Fue un momento de aprendizaje, creatividad y diversión, dejando claro el impacto de estas tecnologías en el futuro del desarrollo.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Para finalizar quería decir que fue un día inolvidable, donde puede volver a rencontrarme con antiguos compañeros, poder conocer de nuevos y como no, compartir opiniones con grandes profesionales. Además, quiero dar las gracias a la impecable organización. Cada año logran superarse, y esta vez no fue la excepción. Mis agradecimientos más sinceros a David, Lluis, Enric, Imma, Mireia y Losel por su esfuerzo y dedicación. ¡Nos vemos el próximo año, ya estoy contando los días para la próxima edición!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

I live in Fortaleza, in the northeast of Brazil, and I believe in the power of communities as catalysts for growth.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Outside of work, I enjoy sharing knowledge, organizing SAP community events, and exploring ways to apply technology to solve real-world problems. What I value most is contributing to the growth of those around me and creating genuine connections through knowledge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51217iF7FFD39907D24E76/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Desktop_pictogram.png" alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What is your area of expertise?&lt;BR /&gt;What does a usual day at work look like for you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My expertise lies in analytical solutions, with a focus on SAP Analytics Cloud, Data Intelligence, and AI-driven initiatives. On a typical day, I work on end-to-end solution development—from data integration to visualization and insight generation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m also involved in automation and process optimization projects, always aligning technology with business needs. A constant in my work is collaboration with different teams, always aiming to deliver real value to the client.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51218i2605363EFF68DD34/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="inspiration_pictogram.png" alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What inspired you to become an SAP Champion in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Community has always played a key role in my journey. Since the beginning of my career, I’ve found support, inspiration, and learning there.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Becoming an SAP Champion is a way to give back everything I’ve received from the community: I want to encourage other professionals, especially from Latin America, to share their experiences and realize the impact they can make by connecting with people around the world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51219i2905480F1FCC6AE2/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="bullet_list_pictogram.png" alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;How do you learn in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your daily/weekly routine in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have a habit of following blogs and Q&amp;amp;A sessions weekly, especially in the areas of SAP Analytics Cloud and Data Intelligence. I also enjoy writing content and sharing lessons learned from day-to-day challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whenever possible, I join discussions and local events like SAP Inside Track Fortaleza, which I’ve helped organize for several years. For me, the constant exchange of experiences is what makes the community so rich.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="circles_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51220i73C820D745D17725/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="circles_pictogram.png" alt="circles_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your suggestion to get the most out of SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Be consistent and intentional. Follow tags related to the topics you enjoy most, engage with content (even if you have simple questions), and share what you’ve learned—even if you think it’s basic. The Community thrives on diverse experiences, and every contribution matters. Also, participating in local or virtual events is a great way to expand your network and spark new ideas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51221i1EA57128883E9979/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A question from Jonys to you:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;“What was the most defining turning point in your SAP journey, and how did the SAP Community support you at that moment?”&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

I live in Yokohama, Japan. I’ve been working as a freelance technical consultant for about seven years. I entered the SAP world right at the beginning of my career 15 years ago, as an ABAP developer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I enjoy investigating things that I don’t know yet or want to know more about. I feel happy when I discover undocumented deployment steps or ways to connect with services — for example, &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/how-to-share-tables-across-different-cap-projects/ba-p/13497184" target="_blank"&gt;how to share tables across CAP projects&lt;/A&gt;. What’s important to me is investigating foundational aspects of application development that many developers are likely to need or struggle with, and sharing those findings with others.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51217iF7FFD39907D24E76/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Desktop_pictogram.png" alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What is your area of expertise?&lt;BR /&gt;What does a usual day at work look like for you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I am currently a member of a Center of Excellence team researching SAP S/4HANA and BTP technologies and supporting projects. My area of expertise is in Fiori elements, ABAP Restful Application Programming Model (RAP) and SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), but I also explore other technologies and services.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In my daily work, I carry out technical research through hands-on experimentation. At the moment, I support two projects, where I share knowledge and help answer technical questions. I also regularly deliver S/4HANA and BTP development training courses for the engineers of my current client.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51218i2605363EFF68DD34/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="inspiration_pictogram.png" alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What inspired you to become an SAP Champion in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I never imagined becoming an SAP Champion, but I was honored to be nominated. When I looked at the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-community-leaders-finder/sap-champions/ba-p/13988156" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Champion page&lt;/A&gt;, I realized that Champions are recognized not necessarily for deep technical or product knowledge, but for their contribution to the SAP Community. I felt that some of my efforts aligned with that, so I gratefully accepted the opportunity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51219i2905480F1FCC6AE2/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="bullet_list_pictogram.png" alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;How do you learn in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your daily/weekly routine in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I learn by reading blog posts and experimenting with technologies that catch my attention. Every morning, I check the titles of all blog posts published the previous day and read the ones that interest me. I share the most helpful blogs in Japanese on X (formerly Twitter). In the evening I browse the Q&amp;amp;A section for topics of my expertise and answer questions when I can.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="circles_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51220i73C820D745D17725/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="circles_pictogram.png" alt="circles_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your suggestion to get the most out of SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you publish a blog post, try to share not only what worked well but also what didn’t. It helps others who face similar challenges —and sometimes, others may even offer solutions or suggestions you hadn't thought of.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51221i1EA57128883E9979/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mio's question to you:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What blog post or answer have you written that you're most proud of—and why?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="People_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51216i6B6C3041A74CC074/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="People_pictogram.png" alt="People_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Roberta, tell us about yourself.&lt;BR /&gt;Who are you, what do you like to do, what is important to you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I am a very focused person, I am always studying. I am the oldest of 8 children, I have always helped my mother raise my brothers and sister and I continue to help her today. I am an accountant, I love arts, traveling and I have been drawing since I was very young.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I love traveling, I am on the road whenever possible. I have visited 24 countries.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The most important thing for me is God, I really like to thank God, because I have the feeling of promises fulfilled with me and with the people around me. Following my life purpose.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51217iF7FFD39907D24E76/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Desktop_pictogram.png" alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What is your area of expertise?&lt;BR /&gt;What does a usual day at work look like for you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I am an accountant. I studied technical accounting and have a degree in accounting sciences. I worked in the accounting area for 15 years before becoming a consultant in the Controlling and Finance module. I took a course in the Projects and Investments Module too, Central Finance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I am a very happy person in my day-to-day life. I don't have many problems waking up early and working a lot. I always say that I don't work when I work with SAP.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I have a lot of experience in taxes around the world and this helps me a lot in my day-to-day life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51218i2605363EFF68DD34/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="inspiration_pictogram.png" alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What inspired you to become an SAP Champion in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I love working with SAP, it makes me feel great, it makes me happy and being able to share knowledge with different people at events, that makes me very happy, very happy indeed. It is very rewarding to work for a cause. It makes life worth living.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51219i2905480F1FCC6AE2/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="bullet_list_pictogram.png" alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;How do you learn in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your daily/weekly routine in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I learn to be a servant every day, every day there are people who need help, who need something, so I live this spirit of transference from people to people.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My days will depend on whether we are planning an event, whatever it may be, but it is always the search for everyone's involvement for the common good.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="circles_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51220i73C820D745D17725/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="circles_pictogram.png" alt="circles_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your suggestion to get the most out of SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I believe it is about finding ways to encourage people to share their knowledge and time. Being part of the SAP community is a donation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51221i1EA57128883E9979/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Roberta's question to you:&lt;BR /&gt;Do you think that the SAP Community of Brazil is fulfilling its purpose in the SAP Inside Track events this year?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In Quarter 2 of the year 2025 we had two meetups. We conducted both a physical gathering and a virtual one. Both were successful. A total of 12 members have joined the Columbus group so far. Many new SAP Community Network logins are being created. Everyone has shown a positive response so far. Here is the wrap-up post of Q2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the first physical meetup we had, we discussed the emerging trends in the utility industry and the pharma industry. We discussed the work people were doing in various projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/634886"&gt;@manish1910&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; talked&amp;nbsp;about emerging trends in the pharma industry. In our group, there are a few end users who are eager to transition their careers into core SAP consulting jobs. We got &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2097162"&gt;@PawanKhatri&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;who&amp;nbsp;sponsored the first physical meetup by providing a meeting room and lunch for the members. Overall we got a fantastic start for our Columbus group.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is our first meetup photograph:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="VaibhavMishra_0-1752014754450.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284335i7D9950E23BC12B45/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="VaibhavMishra_0-1752014754450.png" alt="VaibhavMishra_0-1752014754450.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The second meetup was virtual, where we discussed a specific topic on the SAP S4HANA trial. The request came from &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1924517"&gt;@RajeevShah&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;We discussed details about S4HANA trial access and gave a demo online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1939133"&gt;@Priyanka_Mishra&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;also joined the virtual meetup and shared her project experience in S4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="VaibhavMishra_1-1752014832806.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284336i1E211D43BB454154/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="VaibhavMishra_1-1752014832806.png" alt="VaibhavMishra_1-1752014832806.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are looking forward to our next meetup soon in July 2025.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Vaibhav Mishra&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Communityの皆さん！&lt;BR /&gt;河原哲也さん &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/183053"&gt;@tetsuyakawahara&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;からご紹介いただき、今回「&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/welcome-corner-blog-posts/blog-it-forward-community-challenge/ba-p/12957999" target="_blank"&gt;Blog It Forward&lt;/A&gt;」に参加させていただくことになりました。&lt;BR /&gt;※Blog It Forwardのことは以前から知っていましたが、まさか自分に回ってくるとは思っていませんでした&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;この場を借りて、私のSAPとの関わりやコミュニティ活動についてご紹介させていただきます。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1603390625"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;自己紹介&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;名前：大塚將司（Masashi Otsuka）&lt;BR /&gt;ニックネーム：すみっこ&lt;BR /&gt;役割：S/4HANA拡張領域のコンサルタント／開発者&lt;BR /&gt;SAP歴：ABAP開発から始まり、現在はSAP BTPやAWSを活用したソリューション開発に従事しています。&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;2024年には、SAPジャパンより「SAP BTP Champion」として表彰されました。&lt;BR /&gt;この賞は、SAP BTPを活用した革新的な取り組みや、コミュニティへの貢献が評価されたものです。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1406877120"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1210363615"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;人生を変えた2つのきっかけ&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;私の人生が大きく変わったきっかけは、2つあります。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1272015548"&gt;(1)ブログ「&lt;A href="https://www.sapsumikko.jp/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAPのすみっこ&lt;/A&gt;」をはじめ、コミュニティ「chillSAP」を立ち上げたこと&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;技術的な知見やイベントの記録を発信する中で、思いがけず多くの方に読んでいただけるようになり、社内外から声をかけてもらう機会が増えました。書くことで自分の考えが整理され、発信することで新たな出会いが生まれ、「情報を発信すると情報が集まってくる」「発信は自分を変える力がある」と実感しました。&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;そして同じようにSNSで発信している人たちと「もっと自由に、もっと楽しくSAPを語れる場を作りたい」という思いから始めたchillSAP。&lt;BR /&gt;そこには、年齢も職種も企業も超えて、SAPに関わるあらゆる人が集まりました。&lt;BR /&gt;この活動を通じて、本当に多くの人とつながることができ、人生の景色が変わったと感じています。&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;「chillSAP」は、SAPに関わるすべての人が「ゆるく、楽しく、つながる」ことを目的とした日本発のコミュニティです。&lt;BR /&gt;2019年に設立し、現在までに多数のイベントを開催してきました。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;イベント：SAPなんでもライトニングトーク祭&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAPに関する話題なら何でもOKの5分間のLT大会。自由な発表スタイルが特徴です。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

me!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’d like to take this opportunity to share a bit about my involvement with SAP and my activities within the community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-31282585"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;About me&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Name&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Masashi Otsuka&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Nickname&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Sumikko&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Role&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Consultant/Developer in the S/4HANA Extension Area&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Experience&lt;/STRONG&gt;: I started with ABAP development and am currently engaged in solution development utilizing SAP BTP and AWS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 2024, I was honored by SAP Japan as an&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Champion&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;This award recognizes innovative initiatives leveraging SAP BTP and contributions to the community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1

are two major turning points that significantly changed the course of my life.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--375323861"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(1) Starting the blog “&lt;A href="https://www.sapsumikko.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP Sumikko&lt;/A&gt;” and launching the community “chillSAP”&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While sharing technical insights and event recaps through my blog, I was pleasantly surprised to find that many people started reading it. This led to more opportunities to connect with others, both inside and outside my company. Writing helped me organize my thoughts, and sharing them brought new encounters. I came to truly realize that&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“sharing information attracts more information”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“sharing has the power to transform you.”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Inspired by others who were also actively sharing on social media, I launched&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;chillSAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;with the desire to create a space where people could talk about SAP more freely and enjoyably.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;chillSAP brought together people from all backgrounds—regardless of age, profession, or company—united by their connection to SAP. Through this activity, I’ve been able to connect with so many people, and I feel that the entire landscape of my life has changed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;chillSAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;is a Japan-born community with the goal of helping everyone involved with SAP connect in a relaxed and enjoyable way.&lt;BR /&gt;Founded in 2019, we’ve hosted numerous events to date.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Event Highlight: SAP Anything Lightning Talk Festival&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A 5-minute lightning talk event where any SAP-related topic is welcome.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The presentations are characterized by their free and flexible style,

activities.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="20191004234629.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Next time you report inappropriate content on SAP Community, you’ll notice that we’ve introduced a new process for identifying why the moderation alert has been raised.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When we updated our moderation methods last year to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), we leaned toward a more formal approach for aligning with these new regulations. In doing so, however, we tended to lump all sorts of moderation reports under DSA. As a result, we lost much of the human touch essential to a helpful, cordial moderation program.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To give our moderators more flexibility – while ensuring that we continue to adhere to the law for true DSA cases (e.g., content deemed harmful and illegal under these EU rules) – we have modified the menus that members use when reporting inappropriate content.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first step remains the same: You’ll still find the option for reporting inappropriate content from the dropdown menu next to posts, answers, comments, etc., throughout the site. (Here’s what you’ll see when reporting a question, for example.)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_0-1752071733066.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284601i3FF7F0678FE38D23/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_0-1752071733066.png" alt="jerryjanda_0-1752071733066.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Selecting this option will bring you to a series of menus, as well as a text field, allowing you to provide details about why you’ve reported the content – while also indicating whether the content actually breaks DSA rules.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_1-1752071733070.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284600i22E3BF2F1CC8D02E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jerryjanda_1-1752071733070.png" alt="jerryjanda_1-1752071733070.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In most cases, you’ll simply choose “Non-DSA related alert to moderators” for the reason – as this selection applies to the majority of reports that our moderation team receives (for requests to move content to another area, remove/correct a tag, and so on).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_2-1752071733072.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284602iBB9D127CDAB82688/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_2-1752071733072.png" alt="jerryjanda_2-1752071733072.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you pick “Non-DSA related alert to moderators” as the reason, the “DSA Specification” menu will remain grayed out. (Since the reason is unrelated to a DSA violation, no additional selection is required.) You’ll still have the option to enter additional information (in the “Details” field). For example, you can point out an incorrect tag (and propose a better one) before submitting the report by clicking the “Notify Moderator” button.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_3-1752071733074.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284603i6C55A62773B69504/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_3-1752071733074.png" alt="jerryjanda_3-1752071733074.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This information helps our moderators understand the nature of the issue and work with members quickly to fix the problem, minus the formality of DSA steps that require stiffly worded messages and legally sounding explanations. In other words, for non-DSA cases, the moderators can work with members in a capacity that doesn’t feel overly official, rebuilding the trust and connections associated with moderation before we instituted stricter rules under DSA.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In situations where something does violate the DSA, our moderation team will continue to follow DSA procedures. We only ask that you make certain that it’s a true DSA offense before reporting it as such.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When alerting the moderation team about a DSA violation, you’ll need to select one of the reasons beneath the dashed line (underneath “Non-DSA related alert to moderators”), such as “Illegal Or Harmful Speech” and “Unsafe And/Or Illegal Products.”&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_4-1752071733084.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284605i5B3A16792EA69A6E/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_4-1752071733084.png" alt="jerryjanda_4-1752071733084.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This action opens the “DSA Specification” menu, where you’ll need to select the item related to the reason. There are several to choose.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_5-1752071733089.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284604iFF48CE9C2AC1AEEC/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_5-1752071733089.png" alt="jerryjanda_5-1752071733089.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since we have mapped these reasons and specifications to DSA systems (which is where we need to upload data about our DSA-related activities), we must make sure that we open and submit every DSA case accurately. You can help by selecting the right reason (distinguishing between non-DSA and DSA alerts) and DSA specification (in the event of actual DSA violations) carefully when reporting content that requires moderation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not sure which selection to make? You’ll see some helpful suggestions right next to the menus, providing guidance about what to select and why for common scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_6-1752071733093.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284607i56B3AD9F22BF0E1B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jerryjanda_6-1752071733093.png" alt="jerryjanda_6-1752071733093.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As an example, if you want to report spam, select “Violation of Terms of Use” for the reason and “Other” from the “DSA Specification” menu. (Remember to add some information in the details to help our moderators understand why you’re reporting the content.)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_7-1752071733095.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284606iF57E47AA87ECEBCF/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_7-1752071733095.png" alt="jerryjanda_7-1752071733095.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One last piece of important advice: Negative feedback and curt comments aren’t against the law, and they don’t qualify as harassment and hate speech under DSA regulations. To be more specific, as an example, DSA defines hate speech as “illegal incitement to violence and hatred based on protected characteristics.” Therefore, before reporting member comments as misconduct under DSA, consider whether they can be categorized as illegal speech. Per our &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/welcome-corner-knowledge-base/basic-etiquette-and-tips-for-participating-in-sap-community/ta-p/14147597" target="_blank"&gt;Basic Etiquette and Tips for Participating in SAP Community&lt;/A&gt; guidelines, members should keep discourse civil and try to work out differences, reporting member comments only when they are truly harmful and in violation of DSA regulations. Disagreements and criticism are not grounds for moderator action – especially under DSA.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By differentiating non-DSA and DSA reports, we are taking steps to make moderation friendlier – freeing it from the rigid steps that we applied when we treated all alerts as DSA cases. At the same time, we’ll continue to ensure that SAP Community complies with DSA, protecting our site and our members from the illegal activities that the regulations cover.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

And as well, rest assured that we will provide recordings available for you as well. I would like to welcome as well our SAP community team here. If you didn't get a chance or if you haven't had a chance to visit that table here today and to collect all these beautiful stickers, make sure that you stop by one of our SAP CodeJam this year and you get them as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[DJ &amp;amp; Oler]&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hi there, folks. So we're at Recap 2025, part of Code Connects, this week here in Saliar Road. And I'm very happy to have grabbed Ola for a short time. Ola Lilienthal, head of the CAP organization. And I'm going to ask Ola to talk to us a little bit about one of the topics in his opening taught this morning.welcome, first of all. Thank you so much, DJ, for having me. Well, thanks for being here. So, one of the topics which came hand-in-hand with the annual major release of Cap, which is Cap 9, Node.js 9, which was out in May this year, right, Reg? Also, at the same time, there's a new developer license, developer license 3.2 Cap, is that right? That's great. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Of course. Thanks for giving me the opportunity. Look, there have been a lot of customers and partners approaching us in the past and asking us specific questions about how they can use CAP and in which scenario. And actually, there was some ambiguity in that license and the old license and the developer license. And so we had two ways of handling it. one was we always get into discussions with legal to get explanations of how to interpret that license yes yeah and to then give answers to customers but you don't really want to be in that situation to interpret legal tech it doesn't help you to give your customers answers right so the second approach was let's get those ambiguities fixed let's work on that license so we got together was legal and we formulated some things differently in yet cup specific available license and the gist of it is basically that if you're using CAP as a developer for testing purposes for developing purposes for educational purposes research anything anything you can do that we are happy to for you to use CAP and try it out if you're making money with it if you're using it in a productive scenario we want you to do that or let the productive application run on an sap license but right yeah so today this is either sap BTP or also XSA and that's what we ask you. And in return, we make it really clear that if you do so, you get full support for that CAP application on that platform from us, as I say. That's great. I mean, that's a nice, clear direction. The door's not completely closed yet, right? So it's a journey. Yes. So we are still discussing about the process of open sourcing CAP further. As you all might know, we had a lot of CAP components which we open sourced in the past. over the last years and so that journey is still kind of ongoing um but there are a lot of discussions um in how how far we go here if we also open source the core of cup um and that's still kind of an an open journey i would say yeah and you still continue on that journey um but it's not really decided exactly and in the meantime we have the capjs.org on github and that's you know the you know the nearest part of the journey okay well you heard it here first first folks so oler thanks very much for joining us thanks so much i think it's now time for a uh maybe a small beer maybe a small or beverage we're told beverage yes beverage of choice okay thanks oler thanks so much great&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[Bentley &amp;amp; Anne]&lt;/STRONG&gt; hey everybody it's Josh bentley i'm a community advocate and i'm with Anne who is also a community advocate and we're so happy to be reporting live from the beautiful SAP campus here in Waldorf, Germany. We're prepping for one of our favorite events, which is SAP TechEd. It's going to be on site in Berlin, November 4th through 6th. And we've got a couple of great things that are being promoted by our colleague, Cecilia Wergo, with some blog posts. Lots of information to talk about. And I'm going to let Anne tell you about one of the great things you can submit right now. What is it? We're bringing back the SAP Community Talks. Do you want to share or talk about anything you learned experiences cool demos you built technology you worked with this is your opportunity to submit a talk the submission date is july 14th it's coming up shortly so think fast it's a monday you have all weekend all weekend to work on your submission. Then on July 22nd, we will let everyone know the submission status, if it was accepted or declined. As part of the process, you'll be assigned a developer advocate who will help you through the process. Kind of like a buddy, just to help you get set up in the community theater, which will be on-site in our community clubhouse. Yes. And the developer advocate will reach out to you at the end of July. So we're going to have 20 of these available. These are talks of 20 minutes and what's really cool is you get what's called a lecture pass. So it's a free ticket to be on-site in Berlin. We do not cover travel and expense but you will be able to go onto the show floor as a speaker and attend everything happening at TechEd. The lecture pass does not entitle you to the hands-on workshops. Those you can actually increase your access by paying the difference in price between the free ticket and a full price pass. The other thing we have is another huge community favorite coming back on stage demo jam so lots of people are going to want to be on stage in demo jam showcasing all the great things they build with btp all the great code that they know about and that they can do things with btp the trick is you need to actually get a lot of team members together and submit a proposal that we can look at and see if it's going to be one of the ones we select and this process is happening now through the end of july july. once that's done we're going to go into a selection committee and then do some interviews and select different teams that we will then invite to be on stage the top six yes six will be on stage and you'll have six minutes and you will not be allowed to go over and we'll buzz you off stage and then after that we'll have our plaza meter and it will judge who the best one was and the winner of demo jam and you'll get the trophy if we can find it if we can find it yes exactly it's somewhere around here so that's it we've got demo jam tickets as well so the top teams that are selected those six teams will get to have two people on stage with the same lecture passes and remember no slides exactly no slides no ai generated content yes real thing real thing little people real community connecting yeah all right we will see you in Berlin. Bye. Bye.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[NICO &amp;amp; SIMON]&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hi, everyone, and welcome to the SAP Devolver News. We're here at CodeConnect, and I happen to bump into Simon, who just last week published the CDS MCP plugin. So who's better to introduce it than Simon himself? Yeah, thank you. The CAP MCP plugin is basically a plugin that allows you to handle model context protocols for your OData service directly in CAP. It's PluginPlay. And yeah, check out the link and description. All right. Hope to talk to you soon. Bye.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[Rekha] &lt;/STRONG&gt;Hello, everybody. Are you looking to step up your central point of entry user experience from SAP Build Work Zone Standard Edition, which was previously called SAP Fury Launchpad to SAP Build Work Zone Advanced Edition on SAP BTP? Then here is an in-depth structured guidance to achieve the same.

Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[Shila,Sheena &amp;amp; Shrini]&lt;/STRONG&gt; It was a good mix of SAP customers and partners, making it a true community event. How was your experience, Sheena? It was great, Shilpa. And what I loved the most is that they follow our SAP developers YouTube channel and they like our content. That's so cool, right? And where are you heading next? So I'm heading to Kuala Lumpur first, where Shini will join me. And then we'll both fly together to Bangkok for the next set of code jams. Good luck. Thank you. We are in the SAP Thailand office in Bangkok, where we just finished SAP Gen AI Code Jam. Before coming here, we were in Kuala Lumpur, where we conducted the SAP Build Code Jam. So, Shirni, how did you feel about the SAP Code Jam Roadshow across Southeast Asia? This is the first time we are doing a Code Jam in this region. We've had many of our SAP developers from our customers and partners attend these events. It was exciting to hear their feedback and discuss the latest innovations happening in the BTP space, especially on SAP Gen AI topics. So, yeah, it was interesting, Code Jam. So, Sheena, what is happening next week? Yeah, the team is having a jam-packed schedule with Antonio traveling to India to join Ajay for the next set of integration suite Code Jam Roadshow across various locations in India. So, stay tuned for further updates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;London, UK&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I think one of my greatest passions is the city of London.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first time I saw Parliament was in my 5th-grade English textbook, and it changed my mindset and my desires. My focus was always on seeing London. I've been to the Queen's Land four times and always want to go back. I did an english&amp;nbsp; exchange program, and I honestly get excited just looking at photos of London.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="First time 1.998" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284770i6FB888961112A96D/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="2023-01-26 (1).jpg" alt="First time 1.998" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;First time 1.998&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Hyde Park, 2002" style="width: 185px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284786i96B6629C64C31E87/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="Captura de tela 2024-05-18 141112.png" alt="Hyde Park, 2002" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Hyde Park, 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="2016" style="width: 112px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284772i2200BBFF58A83EC4/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="2023-01-26 (2).jpg" alt="2016" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="2023" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284773i8BFA30E17F9EC1E0/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="20231217_154819.jpg" alt="2023" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;2023&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My mom Cleonice and Marcos Paulo&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My mother is only 16 years older than me, and we have a very good relationship.

When I met Marssel in person in 2017 in Brasília, that was the beginning of this new time. Soon, we talked about hosting SAP events, and we've never stopped. It's wonderful to be with the community and see the difference we can make in the lives of each participant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="marssel_roberta.png" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284776i4A24CEA9DED8BB78/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="marssel_roberta.png" alt="marssel_roberta.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2024-11-20 à(s) 08.49.12_5f8de867.jpg" style="width: 141px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284777i259C3F45968E4859/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2024-11-20 à(s) 08.49.12_5f8de867.jpg" alt="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2024-11-20 à(s) 08.49.12_5f8de867.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="palco_sap.png" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284778i53609758B88D6B12/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="palco_sap.png" alt="palco_sap.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Captura de tela 2024-07-31 165158.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284779i92FB4FA4D75D2DE2/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Captura de tela 2024-07-31 165158.png" alt="Captura de tela 2024-07-31 165158.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;About my activity in SAP world, I recently shared my story in th &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/community-corner-blog-posts/community-member-spotlight-roberta-fernandes-february-2025-edition/ba-p/14002811" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Community Member Spotlight&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

To be a part of SAP Community is a chance to be a part of a major proposal in this life because all our actions impact many people's lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Many thanks folk for all supporting and special thanks to&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/11741"&gt;@Marssel700&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now focus in Marssel´s question:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With S/4HANA, RISE with SAP, and BTP evolving rapidly, what do you think is essential for SAP clients to stay ahead in technology and digital transformation in the coming years?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For SAP customers to stay ahead in digital transformation, continuous evolution withSAP S/4HANA, RISE with SAP e SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) is crucial. This is no longer an option, but a necessity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keep Clean Core : Minimize customizations and use standard S/4HANA functionality to facilitate upgrades and innovations and Adopt industry best practices. Using Rise with full&amp;nbsp; package ( Signavio, BTP, HANA Cloud and business process)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Invest in training and have a huge governance. Invest in IA to help the Company transformation .&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I would like to Blog it forward to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1469833"&gt;@Jonys_Arcanjo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, He is new SAP Champion as me.

This month we want to introduce&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/31"&gt;@lauraschmitz&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;to you which I interviewed recently.&amp;nbsp;Read more about how she got started and what her day to day looks like behind the scenes of the SAP Community.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAP Community Team_Laura Schmitz.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/279732iE61BD5DC40659057/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SAP Community Team_Laura Schmitz.png" alt="SAP Community Team_Laura Schmitz.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Marco Santos (MS): I'm super happy that you've decided to join us today. Laura, thank you so much for being here. It's a great pleasure to feature you as our next Community Team Member Spotlight on SAP Community.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;EM&gt;Thank you, Marco! I'm also very delighted to be part of this interview. I really appreciate the opportunity.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: Awesome. All right, let’s start with an easy one. How did you originally get involved with the SAP Community?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;EM&gt;I got involved with the SAP Community through my second role at SAP. I originally joined the company as a working student in 2018, supporting the learning organization. After finishing my studies in 2020, I applied internally for a Community Advocate role and that’s when I really started getting to know the SAP Community. I’d heard about it now and then in my first role, but I hadn’t really interacted with it until I joined the team.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;STRONG&gt;That’s great to hear! So, you've been on the team for a few years now, but could you tell us a bit more about your current role on the &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;community team and what your day-to-day typically looks like?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;Sure! My current role is Community Event Lead, which means I focus on the strategy and overall concept of community events globally. A big part of my job is helping event organizers by supporting them with everything they need to run successful events for their local communities. I also make sure that these efforts are aligned with our broader SAP Community strategy.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: Sounds like a big responsibility!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;It definitely keeps things exciting! There’s no such thing as a completely typical day, but a common task is reviewing applications from people who are interested in becoming event organizers. I run interviews with them, guide them through onboarding, and ensure any new locations they represent are properly added to our platform.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: So you’re kind of a matchmaker for new communities?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;That’s a good way to put it! I also proactively look into regions we haven’t reached yet and try to find engaged community members who might want to help build something there. Beyond that, I stay in regular contact with existing organizers by discussing their upcoming events, helping them with financial or promotional support, and looking for opportunities for our community team to be present at those events as well.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: That already sounds like a very full day! All right, let’s move on to the next question. Can you share a particularly memorable moment from your time working with the community?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;That would definitely be attending my very first SAP Inside Track. It was in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, in the Netherlands, back in 2022.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It was really special for me because I had joined the community team during COVID. Everyone kept telling me how amazing these events were, and I saw pictures and posts, but I never truly understood what made them so great until I experienced one myself.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The vibe was just incredible! So casual and fun, but also filled with value and genuine knowledge-sharing. And what stood out the most was how welcoming everyone was. People were just happy to connect, learn, and share with each other. I’ll never forget that experience of finally understanding what community is about.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: Yeah, I definitely agree. Meeting people in person: nothing beats that for really understanding what a community is all about.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now, moving on to the next question: You're in contact with many event organizers and community members. How do you stay in touch with community needs and feedback?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;Since my focus is mainly on community events, most of the feedback I receive comes directly from the event organizers. They know they can always reach out, often via email, but we also have a dedicated private group on the SAP Community platform. It’s our main space for communication, resource sharing, and best practice exchange. And it also acts as a feedback channel.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In addition to that, we meet on a quarterly basis with all organizers globally. During those sessions, we share updates, but more importantly, we listen to their needs and concerns. We try our best to address their feedback, even if we can’t act on every single request. For me, having that close, open, and transparent relationship with the organizers is really essential.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Marco Santos: That’s great to hear. Sounds like a very organic and ongoing way to stay in touch with what’s happening on the ground. All right, next up: what do you enjoy most about working on the SAP Community?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;It’s definitely the people! Connecting with people. Of course, I spend a lot of time being online, behind the scenes and working on the platform, but what really brings me joy is the one-on-one interaction. Whether it's working with a group of organizers in a specific city or hearing about someone’s journey, those connections are what make this role so meaningful.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Every local community is different. Every organizer team has their own way of doing things. That diversity, that authenticity, is what I find so special about this work.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: That’s great to hear and a lovely answer! We’ve talked a lot about the past and how you got involved in the community. Now, let’s talk about the future: What’s one thing you’d love to see more of in the SAP Community going forward?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;More in-person connections among community members, and continuous relationship building between our team and community members. That’s definitely something I’d love to see continuing and growing. And also adding new locations to the map, we still have some regions that aren’t yet represented in our community. A great example is the Middle East, which has recently started getting involved with their very first SAP CodeJam in Dubai. Now, the organizer wants to establish more community events in the region and connect people on a regular basis. I’d love to see that trend continue. The more local communities we can support, the better.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: Sounds like a solid plan. More events, more locations leads to more connection! Okay, and now to wrap things up: Is there anything else you’d like to share with the audience? Anything we didn’t cover that you’d like to add?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; I’d like to encourage community members to get active and to engage in their local community - by joining a community event near you or organize your own. There’s a common misconception that you need to be a professional organizer, an expert, or someone with years of experience to lead something meaningful in your community. But the truth is - anyone can start. Real impact often begins with simple actions: a shared interest and a handful of people who just want to connect. And if this this resonates with you and you feel inspired to take that first step, we’d love to hear from you, so reach out and let’s explore what we can build together.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: That’s a perfect way to close it out. Thank you so much, Laura, for joining me today: sharing your journey, your day-to-day, and your vision for the future of the SAP Community. It was great having you here.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;EM&gt;Thanks again, Marco. It’s been a pleasure!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Throughout my career, I’ve led multiple implementation projects and currently work with SAP Partners to co-innovate and build solutions using BTP and AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm also the author of several SAP-focused books, a regular speaker at global SAP events, and an active contributor to the SAP community through mentoring, blogging, and training. You can find the list of all my books on &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap-press.com/author/raja-gupta" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP-Press site&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; and read of my blogs on &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/10685" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What truly drives me is the joy of sharing knowledge - whether it’s through writing, speaking, or engaging with my &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raja-gupta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;43K+ LinkedIn followers&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; on topics around SAP and AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m based out of Bangalore. When I’m not working, I’m usually spending time with my kids and family, reading, or planning our next family trip.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51217iF7FFD39907D24E76/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Desktop_pictogram.png" alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What is your area of expertise?&lt;BR /&gt;What does a usual day at work look like for you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I specialize in SAP BTP, SAP Business AI, Joule, Generative AI, and related technologies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I work closely with SAP Partners to onboard them to SAP Business AI and Joule, guiding them in building real-world solutions. I deliver technical workshops and enablement sessions across various SAP Business AI and BTP topics, often customized for partner-specific needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My day typically involves hands-on collaboration with partners, activating SAP Business AI, addressing technical challenges, and enabling partners to adopt SAP’s latest innovations effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Outside of that, I regularly write, train, and mentor within the SAP ecosystem, sharing insights through blogs and community platforms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51218i2605363EFF68DD34/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="inspiration_pictogram.png" alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What inspired you to become an SAP Champion in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I started engaging with the SAP Community in 2016, when I published my first blog post. What began as a simple attempt to share a few thoughts quickly turned into something much more meaningful — I found a space where people supported each other and where learning didn’t feel one-sided.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Over time, I’ve learned a lot from this community, and that naturally created a sense of responsibility to contribute in return. Whether it’s writing blog posts, speaking at events, or simply answering a question, I’ve seen the real impact of open knowledge-sharing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As someone who spends a lot of time delivering trainings, and enablement sessions, the SAP Champion role felt like a natural extension of what I already do. It allows me to stay connected with the community, support peer learning, and continue contributing in a more focused and visible way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51219i2905480F1FCC6AE2/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="bullet_list_pictogram.png" alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;How do you learn in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your daily/weekly routine in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each morning, I spend the first 30 minutes of my workday either reading something new or drafting content to share with the community. This small but consistent routine keeps me in sync with what’s happening, and also pushes me to contribute back regularly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’ve made the SAP Community a regular part of my learning routine. I follow a set of topics closely and make it a habit to visit their pages frequently to stay updated. I’ve also subscribed to SAP newsletters and topic-specific notifications. These notifications helps me to check in and explore new posts, questions, and discussions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="circles_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51220i73C820D745D17725/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="circles_pictogram.png" alt="circles_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your suggestion to get the most out of SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are three things that have worked well for me and might help others get more value from the SAP Community:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Follow topics that genuinely interest you.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Don’t try to keep up with everything. Pick a few areas you're working on or curious about and make it a habit to check their pages regularly. The focused approach helps you stay updated without getting overwhelmed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Build a simple weekly rhythm.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You don’t need hours. Even spending 15–30 minutes a day reading a blog post, answering a question, or sharing a quick thought can keep you connected and sharp. I personally begin my day with this and it keeps me in sync with what's moving in the ecosystem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Look beyond the screen.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There’s real value in attending SAP Community events for example SAP Inside Track, CodeJam etc. These are great places to meet others working on similar things, ask questions you wouldn’t post online, and build lasting connections.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51221i1EA57128883E9979/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Raja's question to you:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;If you could give one piece of advice to someone new to the SAP Community, what would it be — and why?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

I believe we live in an age where all kinds of knowledge are at our fingertips, which can sometimes be overwhelming; that’s why my main work is helping others learn faster and more easily. I enjoy sharing good meals with friends, playing sports, and diving into a great book.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51217iF7FFD39907D24E76/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Desktop_pictogram.png" alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What is your area of expertise?&lt;BR /&gt;What does a usual day at work look like for you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I started in 1997 programming ABAP, specifically in the HR module. From there I explored the entire functional side without ever leaving the technical world behind, which led me to wrestling with SAP BTP since its early days (HCP, SCP…). I’ve been an official SAP instructor for over 20 years in both HCM and Technology areas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51218i2605363EFF68DD34/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="inspiration_pictogram.png" alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What inspired you to become an SAP Champion in SAP Community?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;I didn’t do anything special to become an SAP Champion; someone nominated me, and here I am &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;. I suppose it has something to do with the content I’ve been creating in Spanish over the years—through my blog (&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.aancos.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;www.aancos.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;), social media, and a couple of podcasts where I share my professional journey (&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.memoriasdeunconsultor.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;www.memoriasdeunconsultor.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;) and chat with ecosystem experts (&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.hablamosdesap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;www.hablamosdesap.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;), including several SAP Champions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51219i2905480F1FCC6AE2/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="bullet_list_pictogram.png" alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;How do you learn in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your daily/weekly routine in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP Community I learn from others, since there are people with deep expertise in many of the areas I’m interested in. I find it always easier to learn when someone guides you, although I don’t follow a strict routine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="circles_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51220i73C820D745D17725/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="circles_pictogram.png" alt="circles_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your suggestion to get the most out of SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I think it’s important to clearly identify a few key thought leaders and accept that you can’t keep up with everything—you risk getting lost in the vast ocean of knowledge. Often, less is more; knowing where to focus is essential.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51221i1EA57128883E9979/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antonio's question to you:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here’s my thought-provoking question: English is undoubtedly the universal language in the technical world, and in SAP in particular (with all due respect to German), so why not create more content for the Spanish-speaking community in their own language?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;What an eventful week it was! (No pun intended)..... Together with &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/149819"&gt;@ajay_soreng&lt;/a&gt;, we did one SAP CodeJam per day - 3 different cities (Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru), 5 different locations, 3 different topics (SAP Integration Suite, SAP Build Process Automation, and SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="roadshow-india-2025.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288924iA21D5296DD08DE86/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="roadshow-india-2025.jpg" alt="roadshow-india-2025.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Everything was planned to perfection but I had a mental misstep. I mistakenly thought that there was a visa on arrival when traveling to India when in reality it requires applying for an e-visa. Unfortunately, I only found this when I was doing my check-in - Saturday, exactly 12 hours before my flight, a bit late right? I immediately applied for an e-visa but given that it was a Saturday I had to wait till Monday for a resolution. Don't get me wrong, the e-visa process is really good and fast but you can't expect much when you end up applying for it too late.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The adventure only starts here...I joined the first event remotely, from Madrid. Once I receive the e-visa approval, I had 4.5 hours to catch the next plane leaving Madrid heading to India. The second event, I also joined it remotely, but this time from Abu Dhabi. The plane touched ground at 06:35, after going through security, I immediate started searching for a quiet place to join the 2nd CodeJam of the week. Fortunately, I found one :-). Straight after the event, I boarded a plane to Hyderabad - not kidding, I was walking to the gate as we were wrapping up the event. I closed my laptop a minute before boarding. Finally, I made it to Hyderabad Tuesday night and I was able to join the last three events in-person. I sincerely want to apologise to the attendees of the first two events as I wasn't able to be there in-person but it was great meeting you virtually; also, doing the event remotely would have not been possible if it wasn't for the great help and support from &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/149819"&gt;@ajay_soreng&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/141830"&gt;@Shilpa_Shankar&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Thanks to you both!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Apart from the physical badges (stickers) that many of the attendees got. All attendees of the different SAP CodeJams will get a special SAP Community badge for attending the events 🪪.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ajmaradiaga_0-1753258051332.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290168i3223E0E71ABE9A86/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="ajmaradiaga_0-1753258051332.png" alt="ajmaradiaga_0-1753258051332.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="badges.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288949iDCAE9AA760B637AA/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="badges.jpg" alt="badges.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1864266143"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Mumbai we did the Connecting systems and services using SAP Integration Suite CodeJam at Colgate office. Thanks Colgate for hosting!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We recently introduced a new exercise where we interact with Slack and send notifications from Cloud Integration to Slack. It was exciting to see many attendees posting their notifications even after the event finished.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Mumbai-1.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288929i384BD5F8C8E7B777/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Mumbai-1.jpg" alt="Mumbai-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Mumbai-2.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288928i04D509A64CB2DAC2/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Mumbai-2.jpg" alt="Mumbai-2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Mumbai3.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288927iA5B11035ADD14E96/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Mumbai3.jpg" alt="Mumbai3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1667752638"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Hyderabad it was all about SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh. We ran the Event-driven integrations CodeJam at two different locations. Thanks Mindset and Infosys for hosting the events.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello everyone, and welcome to the SAP Community Group in &lt;STRONG&gt;Joinville, Brazil&lt;/STRONG&gt;!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joinville is a city located in the south of Brazil, in the state of Santa Catarina. It has a &lt;STRONG&gt;rich historical background&lt;/STRONG&gt;, originally founded in 1851 as part of a land grant from the French royal family to Prince François Ferdinand of Orléans. Soon after, Joinville became home to a large wave of &lt;STRONG&gt;German, Swiss, and Norwegian immigrants&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which shaped its culture, architecture, and traditions that remain vibrant to this day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Often called the &lt;STRONG&gt;“City of Flowers”&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;“City of Princes,”&lt;/STRONG&gt; Joinville is also famous for hosting the &lt;STRONG&gt;Joinville Dance Festival&lt;/STRONG&gt;, one of the largest dance festivals in the world. Its combination of European heritage and Brazilian warmth creates a unique cultural atmosphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, Joinville is recognized as one of Brazil’s most important &lt;STRONG&gt;industrial and technological hubs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, leading innovation in sectors such as software development, automotive, and manufacturing. This thriving economy has helped position the city as a strategic center for digital transformation and SAP-related opportunities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This group is created to connect &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP professionals, students, and enthusiasts&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the region, fostering collaboration, networking, and continuous learning.
