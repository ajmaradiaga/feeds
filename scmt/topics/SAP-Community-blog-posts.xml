    <content>&lt;P&gt;Next time you report inappropriate content on SAP Community, you’ll notice that we’ve introduced a new process for identifying why the moderation alert has been raised.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When we updated our moderation methods last year to comply with the Digital Services Act (DSA), we leaned toward a more formal approach for aligning with these new regulations. In doing so, however, we tended to lump all sorts of moderation reports under DSA. As a result, we lost much of the human touch essential to a helpful, cordial moderation program.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To give our moderators more flexibility – while ensuring that we continue to adhere to the law for true DSA cases (e.g., content deemed harmful and illegal under these EU rules) – we have modified the menus that members use when reporting inappropriate content.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first step remains the same: You’ll still find the option for reporting inappropriate content from the dropdown menu next to posts, answers, comments, etc., throughout the site. (Here’s what you’ll see when reporting a question, for example.)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_0-1752071733066.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284601i3FF7F0678FE38D23/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_0-1752071733066.png" alt="jerryjanda_0-1752071733066.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Selecting this option will bring you to a series of menus, as well as a text field, allowing you to provide details about why you’ve reported the content – while also indicating whether the content actually breaks DSA rules.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_1-1752071733070.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284600i22E3BF2F1CC8D02E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jerryjanda_1-1752071733070.png" alt="jerryjanda_1-1752071733070.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In most cases, you’ll simply choose “Non-DSA related alert to moderators” for the reason – as this selection applies to the majority of reports that our moderation team receives (for requests to move content to another area, remove/correct a tag, and so on).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_2-1752071733072.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284602iBB9D127CDAB82688/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_2-1752071733072.png" alt="jerryjanda_2-1752071733072.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you pick “Non-DSA related alert to moderators” as the reason, the “DSA Specification” menu will remain grayed out. (Since the reason is unrelated to a DSA violation, no additional selection is required.) You’ll still have the option to enter additional information (in the “Details” field). For example, you can point out an incorrect tag (and propose a better one) before submitting the report by clicking the “Notify Moderator” button.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_3-1752071733074.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284603i6C55A62773B69504/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_3-1752071733074.png" alt="jerryjanda_3-1752071733074.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This information helps our moderators understand the nature of the issue and work with members quickly to fix the problem, minus the formality of DSA steps that require stiffly worded messages and legally sounding explanations. In other words, for non-DSA cases, the moderators can work with members in a capacity that doesn’t feel overly official, rebuilding the trust and connections associated with moderation before we instituted stricter rules under DSA.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In situations where something does violate the DSA, our moderation team will continue to follow DSA procedures. We only ask that you make certain that it’s a true DSA offense before reporting it as such.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When alerting the moderation team about a DSA violation, you’ll need to select one of the reasons beneath the dashed line (underneath “Non-DSA related alert to moderators”), such as “Illegal Or Harmful Speech” and “Unsafe And/Or Illegal Products.”&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_4-1752071733084.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284605i5B3A16792EA69A6E/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_4-1752071733084.png" alt="jerryjanda_4-1752071733084.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This action opens the “DSA Specification” menu, where you’ll need to select the item related to the reason. There are several to choose.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_5-1752071733089.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284604iFF48CE9C2AC1AEEC/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_5-1752071733089.png" alt="jerryjanda_5-1752071733089.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since we have mapped these reasons and specifications to DSA systems (which is where we need to upload data about our DSA-related activities), we must make sure that we open and submit every DSA case accurately. You can help by selecting the right reason (distinguishing between non-DSA and DSA alerts) and DSA specification (in the event of actual DSA violations) carefully when reporting content that requires moderation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Not sure which selection to make? You’ll see some helpful suggestions right next to the menus, providing guidance about what to select and why for common scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_6-1752071733093.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284607i56B3AD9F22BF0E1B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jerryjanda_6-1752071733093.png" alt="jerryjanda_6-1752071733093.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As an example, if you want to report spam, select “Violation of Terms of Use” for the reason and “Other” from the “DSA Specification” menu. (Remember to add some information in the details to help our moderators understand why you’re reporting the content.)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jerryjanda_7-1752071733095.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284606iF57E47AA87ECEBCF/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jerryjanda_7-1752071733095.png" alt="jerryjanda_7-1752071733095.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One last piece of important advice: Negative feedback and curt comments aren’t against the law, and they don’t qualify as harassment and hate speech under DSA regulations. To be more specific, as an example, DSA defines hate speech as “illegal incitement to violence and hatred based on protected characteristics.” Therefore, before reporting member comments as misconduct under DSA, consider whether they can be categorized as illegal speech. Per our &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/welcome-corner-knowledge-base/basic-etiquette-and-tips-for-participating-in-sap-community/ta-p/14147597" target="_blank"&gt;Basic Etiquette and Tips for Participating in SAP Community&lt;/A&gt; guidelines, members should keep discourse civil and try to work out differences, reporting member comments only when they are truly harmful and in violation of DSA regulations. Disagreements and criticism are not grounds for moderator action – especially under DSA.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By differentiating non-DSA and DSA reports, we are taking steps to make moderation friendlier – freeing it from the rigid steps that we applied when we treated all alerts as DSA cases. At the same time, we’ll continue to ensure that SAP Community complies with DSA, protecting our site and our members from the illegal activities that the regulations cover.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

We're here at Code Connect 2025. It's Wednesday. It's been an amazing week so far, starting with, on Monday, what, Ajay? hello, everyone. Welcome. And on Monday, we had two Code Jams running in parallel, one for cap and one for ui5 and we had jam-packed rooms and it was really exciting so to see all of you there and it was a very good weather as well over over to you nico thanks yeah so the day after on tuesday we had ui5 con and my personal highlight was meeting many of you the developers and talk tech and also my to-do list of things i want to try out is getting longer and longer the longer of the week gets there's just so much inspiration out here so that was very cool and what happened today dj what happened today that's wednesday was recap recap 2025 um i love this event i love code connect generally but specifically recap again just like nico meeting you folks but learning from you folks learning from everybody everybody from the sessions from the corridor conversations it's just humbling to see so many big brains and so many humble people so many modest people here at the event and we've got something special tomorrow as well as part of the code connect event what is it vitaly so for the very first time code connect family is getting a new child which is HANA techcon and we are really looking for that because the idea came to us last year during the code connect and we really wanted to get hana into the family of all the other technologies at sap so probably you're looking this on friday and we are recording this on wednesday and the event is happening for hana tech con tomorrow so i don't know what would be the proper english phrase to welcome all of those who are looking on friday sorry watching on friday for the event that is going to happen tomorrow while we are recording on wednesday had it have ever happened have it happened yet a universal welcome how about that a universal wealth a universal welcome okay so that's us wrapping it up it's now time for the post recap celebrations downstairs so we're off now have a great evening great morning great afternoon bye for now cheers cheers bye fast forward to thursday and here i am at hana techcon. As we mentioned, it is the very first time we have it. I'm really glad there are many participants joining. There are many people watching this live. And as well, rest assured that we will provide recordings available for you as well. I would like to welcome as well our SAP community team here. If you didn't get a chance or if you haven't had a chance to visit that table here today and to collect all these beautiful stickers, make sure that you stop by one of our SAP CodeJam this year and you get them as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[DJ &amp;amp; Oler]&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hi there, folks. So we're at Recap 2025, part of Code Connects, this week here in Saliar Road. And I'm very happy to have grabbed Ola for a short time. Ola Lilienthal, head of the CAP organization. And I'm going to ask Ola to talk to us a little bit about one of the topics in his opening taught this morning.welcome, first of all. Thank you so much, DJ, for having me. Well, thanks for being here. So, one of the topics which came hand-in-hand with the annual major release of Cap, which is Cap 9, Node.js 9, which was out in May this year, right, Reg? Also, at the same time, there's a new developer license, developer license 3.2 Cap, is that right? That's great. Can you tell us a little bit about that? Of course. Thanks for giving me the opportunity. Look, there have been a lot of customers and partners approaching us in the past and asking us specific questions about how they can use CAP and in which scenario. And actually, there was some ambiguity in that license and the old license and the developer license. And so we had two ways of handling it. one was we always get into discussions with legal to get explanations of how to interpret that license yes yeah and to then give answers to customers but you don't really want to be in that situation to interpret legal tech it doesn't help you to give your customers answers right so the second approach was let's get those ambiguities fixed let's work on that license so we got together was legal and we formulated some things differently in yet cup specific available license and the gist of it is basically that if you're using CAP as a developer for testing purposes for developing purposes for educational purposes research anything anything you can do that we are happy to for you to use CAP and try it out if you're making money with it if you're using it in a productive scenario we want you to do that or let the productive application run on an sap license but right yeah so today this is either sap BTP or also XSA and that's what we ask you. And in return, we make it really clear that if you do so, you get full support for that CAP application on that platform from us, as I say. That's great. I mean, that's a nice, clear direction. The door's not completely closed yet, right? So it's a journey. Yes. So we are still discussing about the process of open sourcing CAP further. As you all might know, we had a lot of CAP components which we open sourced in the past. over the last years and so that journey is still kind of ongoing um but there are a lot of discussions um in how how far we go here if we also open source the core of cup um and that's still kind of an an open journey i would say yeah and you still continue on that journey um but it's not really decided exactly and in the meantime we have the capjs.org on github and that's you know the you know the nearest part of the journey okay well you heard it here first first folks so oler thanks very much for joining us thanks so much i think it's now time for a uh maybe a small beer maybe a small or beverage we're told beverage yes beverage of choice okay thanks oler thanks so much great&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[Bentley &amp;amp; Anne]&lt;/STRONG&gt; hey everybody it's Josh bentley i'm a community advocate and i'm with Anne who is also a community advocate and we're so happy to be reporting live from the beautiful SAP campus here in Waldorf, Germany. We're prepping for one of our favorite events, which is SAP TechEd. It's going to be on site in Berlin, November 4th through 6th. And we've got a couple of great things that are being promoted by our colleague, Cecilia Wergo, with some blog posts. Lots of information to talk about. And I'm going to let Anne tell you about one of the great things you can submit right now. What is it? We're bringing back the SAP Community Talks. Do you want to share or talk about anything you learned experiences cool demos you built technology you worked with this is your opportunity to submit a talk the submission date is july 14th it's coming up shortly so think fast it's a monday you have all weekend all weekend to work on your submission. Then on July 22nd, we will let everyone know the submission status, if it was accepted or declined. As part of the process, you'll be assigned a developer advocate who will help you through the process. Kind of like a buddy, just to help you get set up in the community theater, which will be on-site in our community clubhouse. Yes. And the developer advocate will reach out to you at the end of July. So we're going to have 20 of these available. These are talks of 20 minutes and what's really cool is you get what's called a lecture pass. So it's a free ticket to be on-site in Berlin. We do not cover travel and expense but you will be able to go onto the show floor as a speaker and attend everything happening at TechEd. The lecture pass does not entitle you to the hands-on workshops. Those you can actually increase your access by paying the difference in price between the free ticket and a full price pass. The other thing we have is another huge community favorite coming back on stage demo jam so lots of people are going to want to be on stage in demo jam showcasing all the great things they build with btp all the great code that they know about and that they can do things with btp the trick is you need to actually get a lot of team members together and submit a proposal that we can look at and see if it's going to be one of the ones we select and this process is happening now through the end of july july. once that's done we're going to go into a selection committee and then do some interviews and select different teams that we will then invite to be on stage the top six yes six will be on stage and you'll have six minutes and you will not be allowed to go over and we'll buzz you off stage and then after that we'll have our plaza meter and it will judge who the best one was and the winner of demo jam and you'll get the trophy if we can find it if we can find it yes exactly it's somewhere around here so that's it we've got demo jam tickets as well so the top teams that are selected those six teams will get to have two people on stage with the same lecture passes and remember no slides exactly no slides no ai generated content yes real thing real thing little people real community connecting yeah all right we will see you in Berlin. Bye. Bye.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[NICO &amp;amp; SIMON]&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hi, everyone, and welcome to the SAP Devolver News. We're here at CodeConnect, and I happen to bump into Simon, who just last week published the CDS MCP plugin. So who's better to introduce it than Simon himself? Yeah, thank you. The CAP MCP plugin is basically a plugin that allows you to handle model context protocols for your OData service directly in CAP. It's PluginPlay. And yeah, check out the link and description. All right. Hope to talk to you soon. Bye.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[Rekha] &lt;/STRONG&gt;Hello, everybody. Are you looking to step up your central point of entry user experience from SAP Build Work Zone Standard Edition, which was previously called SAP Fury Launchpad to SAP Build Work Zone Advanced Edition on SAP BTP? Then here is an in-depth structured guidance to achieve the same. In this blog post written by our SAP Build Works on Product Manager Yumna Abbasi, you could understand the overview of SAP Build Works on Standard Edition and SAP Build Works on Advanced Edition. The key differences between these two offerings, information regarding the subscription and service plans, end-to-end transition path. Under transition, crucial steps like accessing the current implementation, planning the migration, exporting the content, setting up SAP billboards on advanced edition, content migration, how to use the existing configurations, best practices to follow during implementation, testing, validation, change management, and go live are well documented. Get ready to provide your business users a multimedia rich user experience with SAP Build WorkZone Advanced Edition. For more details, refer to the blog post. Link is provided in the description box. Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;[Shila,Sheena &amp;amp; Shrini]&lt;/STRONG&gt; It was a good mix of SAP customers and partners, making it a true community event. How was your experience, Sheena? It was great, Shilpa. And what I loved the most is that they follow our SAP developers YouTube channel and they like our content. That's so cool, right? And where are you heading next? So I'm heading to Kuala Lumpur first, where Shini will join me. And then we'll both fly together to Bangkok for the next set of code jams. Good luck. Thank you. We are in the SAP Thailand office in Bangkok, where we just finished SAP Gen AI Code Jam. Before coming here, we were in Kuala Lumpur, where we conducted the SAP Build Code Jam. So, Shirni, how did you feel about the SAP Code Jam Roadshow across Southeast Asia? This is the first time we are doing a Code Jam in this region. We've had many of our SAP developers from our customers and partners attend these events. It was exciting to hear their feedback and discuss the latest innovations happening in the BTP space, especially on SAP Gen AI topics. So, yeah, it was interesting, Code Jam. So, Sheena, what is happening next week? Yeah, the team is having a jam-packed schedule with Antonio traveling to India to join Ajay for the next set of integration suite Code Jam Roadshow across various locations in India. So, stay tuned for further updates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;London, UK&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I think one of my greatest passions is the city of London.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first time I saw Parliament was in my 5th-grade English textbook, and it changed my mindset and my desires. My focus was always on seeing London. I've been to the Queen's Land four times and always want to go back. I did an english&amp;nbsp; exchange program, and I honestly get excited just looking at photos of London.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="First time 1.998" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284770i6FB888961112A96D/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="2023-01-26 (1).jpg" alt="First time 1.998" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;First time 1.998&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Hyde Park, 2002" style="width: 185px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284786i96B6629C64C31E87/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="Captura de tela 2024-05-18 141112.png" alt="Hyde Park, 2002" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Hyde Park, 2002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="2016" style="width: 112px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284772i2200BBFF58A83EC4/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="2023-01-26 (2).jpg" alt="2016" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="2023" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/284773i8BFA30E17F9EC1E0/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="20231217_154819.jpg" alt="2023" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;2023&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My mom Cleonice and Marcos Paulo&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My mother is only 16 years older than me, and we have a very good relationship.

This is no longer an option, but a necessity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keep Clean Core : Minimize customizations and use standard S/4HANA functionality to facilitate upgrades and innovations and Adopt industry best practices. Using Rise with full&amp;nbsp; package ( Signavio, BTP, HANA Cloud and business process)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Invest in training and have a huge governance. Invest in IA to help the Company transformation .&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I would like to Blog it forward to&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1469833"&gt;@Jonys_Arcanjo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, He is new SAP Champion as me. And my question is what´s is next step as SAP Champion, how this position impact your life?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAP Community Team_Laura Schmitz.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/279732iE61BD5DC40659057/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SAP Community Team_Laura Schmitz.png" alt="SAP Community Team_Laura Schmitz.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Marco Santos (MS): I'm super happy that you've decided to join us today. Laura, thank you so much for being here. It's a great pleasure to feature you as our next Community Team Member Spotlight on SAP Community.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;EM&gt;Thank you, Marco! I'm also very delighted to be part of this interview. I really appreciate the opportunity.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: Awesome. All right, let’s start with an easy one. How did you originally get involved with the SAP Community?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;EM&gt;I got involved with the SAP Community through my second role at SAP. I originally joined the company as a working student in 2018, supporting the learning organization. After finishing my studies in 2020, I applied internally for a Community Advocate role and that’s when I really started getting to know the SAP Community. I’d heard about it now and then in my first role, but I hadn’t really interacted with it until I joined the team.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;STRONG&gt;That’s great to hear! So, you've been on the team for a few years now, but could you tell us a bit more about your current role on the &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;community team and what your day-to-day typically looks like?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;Sure! My current role is Community Event Lead, which means I focus on the strategy and overall concept of community events globally. A big part of my job is helping event organizers by supporting them with everything they need to run successful events for their local communities. I also make sure that these efforts are aligned with our broader SAP Community strategy.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: Sounds like a big responsibility!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;It definitely keeps things exciting! There’s no such thing as a completely typical day, but a common task is reviewing applications from people who are interested in becoming event organizers. I run interviews with them, guide them through onboarding, and ensure any new locations they represent are properly added to our platform.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: So you’re kind of a matchmaker for new communities?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;That’s a good way to put it! I also proactively look into regions we haven’t reached yet and try to find engaged community members who might want to help build something there. Beyond that, I stay in regular contact with existing organizers by discussing their upcoming events, helping them with financial or promotional support, and looking for opportunities for our community team to be present at those events as well.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: That already sounds like a very full day! All right, let’s move on to the next question. Can you share a particularly memorable moment from your time working with the community?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;That would definitely be attending my very first SAP Inside Track. It was in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, in the Netherlands, back in 2022.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It was really special for me because I had joined the community team during COVID. Everyone kept telling me how amazing these events were, and I saw pictures and posts, but I never truly understood what made them so great until I experienced one myself.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The vibe was just incredible! So casual and fun, but also filled with value and genuine knowledge-sharing. And what stood out the most was how welcoming everyone was. People were just happy to connect, learn, and share with each other. I’ll never forget that experience of finally understanding what community is about.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: Yeah, I definitely agree. Meeting people in person: nothing beats that for really understanding what a community is all about.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now, moving on to the next question: You're in contact with many event organizers and community members. How do you stay in touch with community needs and feedback?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;Since my focus is mainly on community events, most of the feedback I receive comes directly from the event organizers. They know they can always reach out, often via email, but we also have a dedicated private group on the SAP Community platform. It’s our main space for communication, resource sharing, and best practice exchange. And it also acts as a feedback channel.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In addition to that, we meet on a quarterly basis with all organizers globally. During those sessions, we share updates, but more importantly, we listen to their needs and concerns. We try our best to address their feedback, even if we can’t act on every single request. For me, having that close, open, and transparent relationship with the organizers is really essential.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Marco Santos: That’s great to hear. Sounds like a very organic and ongoing way to stay in touch with what’s happening on the ground. All right, next up: what do you enjoy most about working on the SAP Community?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;It’s definitely the people! Connecting with people. Of course, I spend a lot of time being online, behind the scenes and working on the platform, but what really brings me joy is the one-on-one interaction. Whether it's working with a group of organizers in a specific city or hearing about someone’s journey, those connections are what make this role so meaningful.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Every local community is different. Every organizer team has their own way of doing things. That diversity, that authenticity, is what I find so special about this work.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: That’s great to hear and a lovely answer! We’ve talked a lot about the past and how you got involved in the community. Now, let’s talk about the future: What’s one thing you’d love to see more of in the SAP Community going forward?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;EM&gt;More in-person connections among community members, and continuous relationship building between our team and community members. That’s definitely something I’d love to see continuing and growing. And also adding new locations to the map, we still have some regions that aren’t yet represented in our community. A great example is the Middle East, which has recently started getting involved with their very first SAP CodeJam in Dubai. Now, the organizer wants to establish more community events in the region and connect people on a regular basis. I’d love to see that trend continue. The more local communities we can support, the better.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: Sounds like a solid plan. More events, more locations leads to more connection! Okay, and now to wrap things up: Is there anything else you’d like to share with the audience? Anything we didn’t cover that you’d like to add?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; I’d like to encourage community members to get active and to engage in their local community - by joining a community event near you or organize your own. There’s a common misconception that you need to be a professional organizer, an expert, or someone with years of experience to lead something meaningful in your community. But the truth is - anyone can start. Real impact often begins with simple actions: a shared interest and a handful of people who just want to connect. And if this this resonates with you and you feel inspired to take that first step, we’d love to hear from you, so reach out and let’s explore what we can build together.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;MS: That’s a perfect way to close it out. Thank you so much, Laura, for joining me today: sharing your journey, your day-to-day, and your vision for the future of the SAP Community. It was great having you here.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Laura Schmitz&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: &lt;EM&gt;Thanks again, Marco. It’s been a pleasure!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Throughout my career, I’ve led multiple implementation projects and currently work with SAP Partners to co-innovate and build solutions using BTP and AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm also the author of several SAP-focused books, a regular speaker at global SAP events, and an active contributor to the SAP community through mentoring, blogging, and training. You can find the list of all my books on &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap-press.com/author/raja-gupta" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP-Press site&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; and read of my blogs on &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/10685" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What truly drives me is the joy of sharing knowledge - whether it’s through writing, speaking, or engaging with my &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raja-gupta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;43K+ LinkedIn followers&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; on topics around SAP and AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m based out of Bangalore. When I’m not working, I’m usually spending time with my kids and family, reading, or planning our next family trip.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51217iF7FFD39907D24E76/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Desktop_pictogram.png" alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What is your area of expertise?&lt;BR /&gt;What does a usual day at work look like for you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I specialize in SAP BTP, SAP Business AI, Joule, Generative AI, and related technologies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I work closely with SAP Partners to onboard them to SAP Business AI and Joule, guiding them in building real-world solutions. I deliver technical workshops and enablement sessions across various SAP Business AI and BTP topics, often customized for partner-specific needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My day typically involves hands-on collaboration with partners, activating SAP Business AI, addressing technical challenges, and enabling partners to adopt SAP’s latest innovations effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Outside of that, I regularly write, train, and mentor within the SAP ecosystem, sharing insights through blogs and community platforms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51218i2605363EFF68DD34/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="inspiration_pictogram.png" alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What inspired you to become an SAP Champion in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I started engaging with the SAP Community in 2016, when I published my first blog post. What began as a simple attempt to share a few thoughts quickly turned into something much more meaningful — I found a space where people supported each other and where learning didn’t feel one-sided.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Over time, I’ve learned a lot from this community, and that naturally created a sense of responsibility to contribute in return. Whether it’s writing blog posts, speaking at events, or simply answering a question, I’ve seen the real impact of open knowledge-sharing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As someone who spends a lot of time delivering trainings, and enablement sessions, the SAP Champion role felt like a natural extension of what I already do. It allows me to stay connected with the community, support peer learning, and continue contributing in a more focused and visible way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51219i2905480F1FCC6AE2/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="bullet_list_pictogram.png" alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;How do you learn in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your daily/weekly routine in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each morning, I spend the first 30 minutes of my workday either reading something new or drafting content to share with the community. This small but consistent routine keeps me in sync with what’s happening, and also pushes me to contribute back regularly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’ve made the SAP Community a regular part of my learning routine. I follow a set of topics closely and make it a habit to visit their pages frequently to stay updated. I’ve also subscribed to SAP newsletters and topic-specific notifications. These notifications helps me to check in and explore new posts, questions, and discussions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="circles_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51220i73C820D745D17725/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="circles_pictogram.png" alt="circles_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your suggestion to get the most out of SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are three things that have worked well for me and might help others get more value from the SAP Community:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Follow topics that genuinely interest you.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Don’t try to keep up with everything. Pick a few areas you're working on or curious about and make it a habit to check their pages regularly. The focused approach helps you stay updated without getting overwhelmed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Build a simple weekly rhythm.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You don’t need hours. Even spending 15–30 minutes a day reading a blog post, answering a question, or sharing a quick thought can keep you connected and sharp. I personally begin my day with this and it keeps me in sync with what's moving in the ecosystem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Look beyond the screen.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There’s real value in attending SAP Community events for example SAP Inside Track, CodeJam etc. These are great places to meet others working on similar things, ask questions you wouldn’t post online, and build lasting connections.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51221i1EA57128883E9979/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Raja's question to you:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;If you could give one piece of advice to someone new to the SAP Community, what would it be — and why?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

I believe we live in an age where all kinds of knowledge are at our fingertips, which can sometimes be overwhelming; that’s why my main work is helping others learn faster and more easily. I enjoy sharing good meals with friends, playing sports, and diving into a great book.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51217iF7FFD39907D24E76/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Desktop_pictogram.png" alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What is your area of expertise?&lt;BR /&gt;What does a usual day at work look like for you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I started in 1997 programming ABAP, specifically in the HR module. From there I explored the entire functional side without ever leaving the technical world behind, which led me to wrestling with SAP BTP since its early days (HCP, SCP…). I’ve been an official SAP instructor for over 20 years in both HCM and Technology areas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51218i2605363EFF68DD34/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="inspiration_pictogram.png" alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What inspired you to become an SAP Champion in SAP Community?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;I didn’t do anything special to become an SAP Champion; someone nominated me, and here I am &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;. I suppose it has something to do with the content I’ve been creating in Spanish over the years—through my blog (&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.aancos.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;www.aancos.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;), social media, and a couple of podcasts where I share my professional journey (&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.memoriasdeunconsultor.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;www.memoriasdeunconsultor.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;) and chat with ecosystem experts (&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://www.hablamosdesap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;www.hablamosdesap.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;), including several SAP Champions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51219i2905480F1FCC6AE2/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="bullet_list_pictogram.png" alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;How do you learn in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your daily/weekly routine in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP Community I learn from others, since there are people with deep expertise in many of the areas I’m interested in. I find it always easier to learn when someone guides you, although I don’t follow a strict routine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="circles_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51220i73C820D745D17725/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="circles_pictogram.png" alt="circles_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your suggestion to get the most out of SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I think it’s important to clearly identify a few key thought leaders and accept that you can’t keep up with everything—you risk getting lost in the vast ocean of knowledge. Often, less is more; knowing where to focus is essential.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51221i1EA57128883E9979/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Antonio's question to you:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Here’s my thought-provoking question: English is undoubtedly the universal language in the technical world, and in SAP in particular (with all due respect to German), so why not create more content for the Spanish-speaking community in their own language?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;What an eventful week it was! (No pun intended)..... Together with &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/149819"&gt;@ajay_soreng&lt;/a&gt;, we did one SAP CodeJam per day - 3 different cities (Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru), 5 different locations, 3 different topics (SAP Integration Suite, SAP Build Process Automation, and SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="roadshow-india-2025.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288924iA21D5296DD08DE86/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="roadshow-india-2025.jpg" alt="roadshow-india-2025.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Everything was planned to perfection but I had a mental misstep. I mistakenly thought that there was a visa on arrival when traveling to India when in reality it requires applying for an e-visa. Unfortunately, I only found this when I was doing my check-in - Saturday, exactly 12 hours before my flight, a bit late right? I immediately applied for an e-visa but given that it was a Saturday I had to wait till Monday for a resolution. Don't get me wrong, the e-visa process is really good and fast but you can't expect much when you end up applying for it too late.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The adventure only starts here...I joined the first event remotely, from Madrid. Once I receive the e-visa approval, I had 4.5 hours to catch the next plane leaving Madrid heading to India. The second event, I also joined it remotely, but this time from Abu Dhabi. The plane touched ground at 06:35, after going through security, I immediate started searching for a quiet place to join the 2nd CodeJam of the week. Fortunately, I found one :-). Straight after the event, I boarded a plane to Hyderabad - not kidding, I was walking to the gate as we were wrapping up the event. I closed my laptop a minute before boarding. Finally, I made it to Hyderabad Tuesday night and I was able to join the last three events in-person. I sincerely want to apologise to the attendees of the first two events as I wasn't able to be there in-person but it was great meeting you virtually; also, doing the event remotely would have not been possible if it wasn't for the great help and support from &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/149819"&gt;@ajay_soreng&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/141830"&gt;@Shilpa_Shankar&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Thanks to you both!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Apart from the physical badges (stickers) that many of the attendees got. All attendees of the different SAP CodeJams will get a special SAP Community badge for attending the events 🪪.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ajmaradiaga_0-1753258051332.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290168i3223E0E71ABE9A86/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="ajmaradiaga_0-1753258051332.png" alt="ajmaradiaga_0-1753258051332.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="badges.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288949iDCAE9AA760B637AA/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="badges.jpg" alt="badges.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1864266143"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Mumbai we did the Connecting systems and services using SAP Integration Suite CodeJam at Colgate office. Thanks Colgate for hosting!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We recently introduced a new exercise where we interact with Slack and send notifications from Cloud Integration to Slack. It was exciting to see many attendees posting their notifications even after the event finished.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Mumbai-1.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288929i384BD5F8C8E7B777/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Mumbai-1.jpg" alt="Mumbai-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Mumbai-2.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288928i04D509A64CB2DAC2/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Mumbai-2.jpg" alt="Mumbai-2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Mumbai3.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/288927iA5B11035ADD14E96/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Mumbai3.jpg" alt="Mumbai3.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1667752638"&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Hyderabad it was all about SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh. We ran the Event-driven integrations CodeJam at two different locations. Thanks Mindset and Infosys for hosting the events.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello everyone, and welcome to the SAP Community Group in &lt;STRONG&gt;Joinville, Brazil&lt;/STRONG&gt;!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joinville is a city located in the south of Brazil, in the state of Santa Catarina. It has a &lt;STRONG&gt;rich historical background&lt;/STRONG&gt;, originally founded in 1851 as part of a land grant from the French royal family to Prince François Ferdinand of Orléans. Soon after, Joinville became home to a large wave of &lt;STRONG&gt;German, Swiss, and Norwegian immigrants&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which shaped its culture, architecture, and traditions that remain vibrant to this day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Often called the &lt;STRONG&gt;“City of Flowers”&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;“City of Princes,”&lt;/STRONG&gt; Joinville is also famous for hosting the &lt;STRONG&gt;Joinville Dance Festival&lt;/STRONG&gt;, one of the largest dance festivals in the world. Its combination of European heritage and Brazilian warmth creates a unique cultural atmosphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, Joinville is recognized as one of Brazil’s most important &lt;STRONG&gt;industrial and technological hubs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, leading innovation in sectors such as software development, automotive, and manufacturing. This thriving economy has helped position the city as a strategic center for digital transformation and SAP-related opportunities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This group is created to connect &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP professionals, students, and enthusiasts&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the region, fostering collaboration, networking, and continuous learning. We invite you to share insights, ask questions, and contribute to building a &lt;STRONG&gt;strong and dynamic SAP community&lt;/STRONG&gt; here in Joinville.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Welcome aboard – let’s grow together!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="joinville-sc.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290275iE25481185E46D396/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="joinville-sc.jpg" alt="joinville-sc.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP Inside Track Munich (#sitMUC) is back ...&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Dear SAP Community,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;On &lt;STRONG&gt;October 11th&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the SAP community will gather once again in Garching for a day full of learning, sharing, and connecting .. and we want you to be part of it.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Whether you're deep into ABAP, building apps on SAP BTP, working with Fiori, S/4HANA, or Analytics, exploring DevOps in SAP, or shaping business processes, driving change in projects, or navigating transformation from a consulting perspective, your insights matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our audience comes from all corners of the SAP universe: developers, consultants, architects, product experts, and curious newcomers. That’s why &lt;STRONG&gt;we’re looking for diverse session ideas&lt;/STRONG&gt;: technical deep dives, lessons learned from projects, open-source initiatives, or even side projects that others can learn from. It doesn’t have to be perfect or polished. If it’s real and relevant to the community, it belongs on stage.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Important dates and submission process:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Call opens: &lt;STRONG&gt;July 24st&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Submission deadline: &lt;STRONG&gt;August 30th&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Speaker selection: by September 5th&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please submit your proposal using our online form:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://sitmuc.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;sitmuc.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There are various &lt;STRONG&gt;session types for your submissions:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Short Presentation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; (20 min)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Presentation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; (40 min)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;you will present a topic to the audience demos, theory, live coding, or anything else that suits your expertise&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Marketplace&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;you will share your topic in a “marketplace” breakout session where everyone is welcome to walk around, visit the various stands, and interact&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What we’re looking for:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;On-site only we’ll be together in person!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;No marketing pitches – just genuine value for the community&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We’d love to hear your ideas whether you’re a seasoned speaker or presenting for the very first time. Let’s make #sitMUC25 another unforgettable community event.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you're unsure about your topic, format, or how to present it no worries! Just drop us an email at &lt;A href="mailto:sitmuc.orga@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;sitmuc.orga@gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, we're happy to help. Or better yet: join our next Stammtisch meetup (14.08.), and let’s chat about your session idea in person.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let’s build this day together. Bring your voice, your story, your topic. We can’t wait to hear it!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;sitMUC Orga team&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1606844488"&gt;A Look Back At CodeConnect 2025&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It's been almost 2 weeks now since I participated in the 2025 CodeConnect event, which was actually my first in-person CodeConnect ever.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;I would've participated in person sooner, but getting tickets is akin to trying to get the most popular item on Black Friday, it requires speed, precision and luck!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;But enough rambling about the tickets! Let's take a look back at my journey to CodeConnect 2025.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1539413702"&gt;UI5Con 2025&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm going to skip the very first day of CodeConnect, mainly due to it being spent in a car for 16 hours, as me and my colleagues made the journey from the northern part of Jutland to St. Leon Rot.&lt;BR /&gt;So for us, the conference didn't start until day 2 with UI5Con, and that was some start.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Image (5).jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290732i8A23A75D2E4027DC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Image (5).jpeg" alt="Image (5).jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Upon arrival at the building, it was straight into networking and trying to decide what sessions were most interesting to participate in.&lt;BR /&gt;We ended up doing a divide and conquer strategy in our group to get the most out of the day, with of course a focus on getting to the hands-on sessions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My day quickly became side-tracked as I caught up with both old and new faces in my effort to connect with all the other developers present at the event.&lt;BR /&gt;Which, to be honest, for a mostly backend/cloud guy like me wasn't all bad. While I do enjoy a tango with the frontend from time to time, my heart belongs to what goes on behind the scenes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But I did catch a lot of good talks still; so here are my take-aways from the first real day at CodeConnect:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ownership of styling is slowly being handed back to the developer, meaning we can now make proper custom components for UI5 that style correctly with the themes such as Horizon.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Still no clear release date for UI5 v2, but we do have a legacy free 1.136 out there now that we can utilize and prepare with&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Promise for UI5 developers that keep in line with the UI5 Linter, that their code will be lift and shift (i.e. go use the linter asap!)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The UI5 repository has completed its moving phase and is now living in its own repository&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accessibility, much like everywhere else in the developer space at the moment, is the talk of the town, and SAP is doing a lot of improvements on this front&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;2 test runners were presented as the replacements for the deprecated Karma runner. I know that I am leaning the most towards the WDI5 route due to it working as a more complete suite.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Webcomponents are the main focus going forward, and even though there is no timestamp on it, it seems like it will replace many of our current components going forward&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;That was pretty much my experience and take-aways for the first day there, and with it we wrapped up the UI5Con with some great food before heading back to the hotel.&lt;BR /&gt;The next for me, I knew would be something special.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1342900197"&gt;reCAP 2025&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Image (4).jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290725i12EDCA87F0BC4BA9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Image (4).jpeg" alt="Image (4).jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Second day for me at CodeConnect started out with a great opening key note by Daniel Hutzel. Although he ran out of time by the end, I wish we could've listened to him for just a little while longer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The key take-away of this keynote however, was extremely clear. Over the last year, the focus by the CAP team has really been on minimizing the footprint of the CAP/CDS install while optimizing and improving the feature set of the framework.&lt;BR /&gt;And from what we were presented, that definitely looked like it came out as a success. As a developer that uses CAP on a daily basis, both for plugin development and end-user projects, I can definitely say that I have enjoyed the improvements so far.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So a kudos to the CAP team is definitely in order on this! (Now we just need it to be open source!)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, I did not have as much time to participate in the many sessions of this day, as much like the day before, the event became more of a networking experience.&lt;BR /&gt;The sessions I did catch however, were absolutely great and definitely something that you should catch up on if you have the chance;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Both sessions by Mike Zaschka (just always a good listen and everybody loves open source!)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CAP Tools session by Christian Georgi (because you cannot be a good developer without knowing your tools)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Server-side Pre-rendering by Volker Buzek and Wouter Lemaire (a great session with insights into another great open source initiative)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CAP Best vs Bad Practices by Daniel Hutzel&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Gain a superpower by learning how to harness the CDS REPL by DJ Adams (seriously, learn REPL)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While these were the only sessions I managed to catch, I did however experience something extremely important during the reCAP event, and that was the community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I got to connect with so many great people and talk about the passion of this side of the industry, and the love we all share for opens source technologies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I even got the chance to appear on the &lt;A href="https://youtu.be/0PUDy-TkpiQ" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Developer News&lt;/A&gt; to share my own open source contribution (&lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simon-vestergaard-laursen-7b98406a_im-excited-to-announce-the-cap-mcp-plugin-activity-7345337883202879488-NAhN?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAAA63yH0BMm6ssu6DfY9QWAt5VYMMUO0YUu4" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;MCP Plugin for CAP&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And that is something I wouldn't trade for anything.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Image (3).jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290724iB2E249D2662D9D4C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Image (3).jpeg" alt="Image (3).jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1146386692"&gt;You Should Attend&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope it is clear from my post here that going to CodeConnect is an experience, no matter how you plan it. It is an event filled with great people and some great discussions around the subjects we all work with on a daily basis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Never in a million years would I have imagined that going to CodeConnect would have resulted in me getting to participate in the SAP Developer News, nor that I would get to have great open discussions with other open source contributors.&lt;BR /&gt;It is definitely worth it, so if you get the chance I highly recommend that you participate!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hopefully I will get the chance to contribute to the speakers list next year!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Image (2).jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290722iE880761F19A2E83E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Image (2).jpeg" alt="Image (2).jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

&lt;P&gt;Implementing a tree view in the ABAP RESTful application programming model requires different entities, and author&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1451075"&gt;@Vivek_Sahu_21&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;covers how you can show structured, hierarchical data -- in a parent-child format -- that UI applications and analytics tools can consume easily, providing a smooth user experience.&lt;/P&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;No último sábado (26/07), tive a oportunidade de participar do &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Inside Track São Paulo 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;, um evento que me deixou motivado e, acima de tudo, grato por fazer parte dessa comunidade incrível.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Desde o momento em que entrei, o clima era de colaboração, aprendizado e inovação. Estar entre profissionais que respiram SAP, ouvindo sobre temas como &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA, SAP BTP, Clean Core, Signavio e SAP Activate&lt;/STRONG&gt;, foi como abrir uma janela para o futuro que desejo construir.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mais do que palestras técnicas, o que me marcou foi o ambiente: &lt;STRONG&gt;acessível, acolhedor e cheio de gente com brilho nos olhos&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Profissionais dispostos a compartilhar, ensinar e crescer juntos. Cada conversa, cada slide, cada café compartilhado — tudo fez sentido para quem, como eu, está trilhando o caminho para atuar com SAP S/4HANA em projetos de transformação digital.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Saí do evento com a cabeça cheia de ideias e o coração leve. Reforço aqui o quanto &lt;STRONG&gt;eventos como o SIT são fundamentais para conectar pessoas e ampliar horizontes&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Que venham mais encontros como esse!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Parabéns a todos os organizadores, palestrantes e participantes. Vocês fizeram a diferença!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2025-07-27 à(s) 18.45.54_0bc67872.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292358i098FC50FE3A9B9B1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2025-07-27 à(s) 18.45.54_0bc67872.jpg" alt="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2025-07-27 à(s) 18.45.54_0bc67872.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2025-07-27 à(s) 18.45.54_bae26a9f.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292357iDE188565D6C8E083/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2025-07-27 à(s) 18.45.54_bae26a9f.jpg" alt="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2025-07-27 à(s) 18.45.54_bae26a9f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2025-07-27 à(s) 18.45.54_230e5cf5.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/292359i1E6D0C73D0999AFE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2025-07-27 à(s) 18.45.54_230e5cf5.jpg" alt="Imagem do WhatsApp de 2025-07-27 à(s) 18.45.54_230e5cf5.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Шановна спільното &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;З 1998 року наша команда забезпечує локалізацію рішень &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; для українських компаній, адаптуючи їх до національних стандартів і законодавства. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; в Україні — це не лише міжнародні &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;IT&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;-рішення, а й інвестиції в локальні адаптації, що враховують потреби українського ринку.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP в Україні — це не лише міжнародні IT-рішення, а й інвестиції в локальні адаптації, що враховують потреби українського ринку. Завдяки цьому компанії отримують ефективні інструменти як для внутрішнього ринку, так і для виходу на міжнародну арену.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Основні аспекти локалізації в &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Мовні та культурні аспекти&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Переклад текстів&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Локалізація користувацького інтерфейсу, звітів, а також AI-powered instant переклад документації та інших текстових документів за допомогою &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Translation Hub&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Культурна адаптація&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Врахування культурних особливостей, таких як формати дат, чисел, валют, тощо&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Правові та регуляторні вимоги&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Податкові закони&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Враховування місцевих податкових правил та &lt;SPAN&gt;вимог до &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;обліку та &lt;/SPAN&gt;звітності.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Регуляторні стандарти&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Забезпечення відповідності місцевим законодавчим та регуляторним вимогам.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Фінансові та бухгалтерські аспекти&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Бухгалтерський облік&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;та звітність&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Адаптація під місцеві бухгалтерські стандарти та практики.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Валютні операції&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Підтримка різних валют та обмінних курсів.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Адміністрування персоналу та облік заробітної плати:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Підтримка законодавства:&lt;/STRONG&gt; адаптація до місцевих вимог&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Логістика та постачання&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Логістичні процеси&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Адаптація логістичних процесів до місцевих умов та інфраструктури.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Тестування та валідація&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Функціональне тестування&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Перевірка функціональності системи в умовах локалізованого середовища.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Регресійне тестування&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Перевірка того, що зміни внаслідок локалізації не вплинули негативно на існуючу функціональність.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Підтримка та обслуговування&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Підтримка законодавчих змін: &lt;/STRONG&gt;адаптація локалізованої функціональності до змін в законодавстві&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Міжнародна підтримка&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Надання підтримки користувачам на місцевых мовах та врахування місцевих часових зон.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Оновлення та патчі&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Вчасне оновлення системи для відповідності змінам в місцевому законодавстві та регуляторних вимогах.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Знайомтесь з нашими найкращими експертами&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;та приєднуйтесь&lt;/STRONG&gt; до української спільноти SAP з локалізації задля обміну потребами, знаннями та досвідом та участі в прийнятті найбільш ефективних рішень з розвитку локалізації.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Тетяна Віляєва&lt;/STRONG&gt; – eкспертка з фінансових onPrem рішень SAP та українського законодавства.

This applies to my professional occupation but also to my personal life where, whenever possible, I use some of my free time to grow my knowledge on different technologies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51217iF7FFD39907D24E76/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Desktop_pictogram.png" alt="Desktop_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What is your area of expertise?&lt;BR /&gt;What does a usual day at work look like for you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The majority of my years of experience were dedicated to integration projects – between SAP systems and also external systems in and out of SAP. My daily activities can vary widely from supporting and actively working on the technical aspects of an integration project (coding) as well as a close advisor to the customer on how to design such a solution and tackle any challenges along the way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51218i2605363EFF68DD34/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="inspiration_pictogram.png" alt="inspiration_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;What inspired you to become an SAP Champion in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I was challenged by Manuel Robalinho if I would be interested to join the SAP Champions group and I obviously could not decline such an offer. It is a true honor to have been accepted!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51219i2905480F1FCC6AE2/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="bullet_list_pictogram.png" alt="bullet_list_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;How do you learn in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your daily/weekly routine in SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is one of my go-to resources online every time I have a doubt or hit a roadblock in my projects. It has proven useful in the past several times and I’m sure it’ll continue to be! I also keep an eye on some blog posts/tutorials on topics I follow to keep me up to date on that.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="circles_pictogram.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51220i73C820D745D17725/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="circles_pictogram.png" alt="circles_pictogram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is your suggestion to get the most out of SAP Community?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Be sure to subscribe to topics and tags related with your areas of your interest so you can receive communications when there’s new activity like blogs, news, events, or Questions/Answers. You can also keep an eye on location groups closeby to eventually discover and attend any SAP Community event, be it online or in person – this is one of the best things the community has to offer for you to learn and build new connections!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" style="width: 87px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/51221i1EA57128883E9979/image-dimensions/87x87?v=v2" width="87" height="87" role="button" title="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" alt="Arrow_pictogramm_new.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pedro's question to you:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What would you recommend as hot topics (or areas of interest) in the SAP community for me to follow? I’m always willing to learn &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
