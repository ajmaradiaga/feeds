    <content>&lt;P&gt;This was a pretty fun and challenging Devtoberfest Scavenger Hunt. It blends a bit of fun puzzle-solving activities along with deep-dive into essential SAP developer tools. And now that the official Devtoberfest contest period is over, I think it would be okay for me to share the puzzle answers?!?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Anyway, like most, I've been gathering parts of the secret HEX digits for the final secret phrase and by mission 9,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/72"&gt;@Dan_Wroblewski&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;said that we should have 36 out of the 37 HEX digits and we're also missing a multiplier that will then make it a 38 HEX digits and when we convert that HEX to ASCII, we'll get a "secret phrase" to the puzzle! Then surprisingly,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1790429"&gt;@JRomeroGo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;first posted a comment that said (he/she) is done! Then, followed by a few more community members&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2080419"&gt;@FLang&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/159230"&gt;@Tahemmout&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1487178"&gt;@Swetha__Balusamy&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/172124"&gt;@gerardminari&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; and others all saying that they're done too! This was very inspiring to also try and break the secret phrase myself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, I personally wanted to try something new and different and since I have been practicing AI-assisted coding for quite some time now, the question comes, &lt;STRONG&gt;"Can AI solve this puzzle?".&lt;/STRONG&gt; Honestly, at this point, I have zero doubt that AI can do it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1892776317"&gt;Tools&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Personally, I use VS Code and I've tried a number of different AI/Copilot extensions like GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, Amazon Q Developer, etc. but I find that I really liked Cline.bot and I was actually also glad to see it being used in a few of the Devtoberfest videos as well! I have a paid Google API subscription that I use for my own self-learning and that's what I've used for this challenge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IDE:&lt;/STRONG&gt; VS Code&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extension:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Cline (&lt;A href="https://cline.bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://cline.bot&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;LLM:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Google Gemini Pro 2.5&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1696262812"&gt;Planning the Agent.md instructions&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you're not familiar with this - I suggest visiting &lt;A href="https://agents.md" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://agents.md&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;to learn more, but in a nutshell, README.md is for humans while AGENTS.md is meant for AI Agents. With all the details and hints from &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/72"&gt;@Dan_Wroblewski&lt;/a&gt;, I planned out the Agents.md file which is now also doubling as the prompt for the AI Agent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Problem statement
- I've been given 36 characters of a HEX string in the correct sequence.
- I've been told that I am missing one last HEX character in the last position of this string.
- Then, I'm missing a multiplier (digit) that would convert the 37 characters into 38 characters
- With the 38 characters, when converted from HEX to ASCII, it would expose a secret phrase!

## Objective
- Generate a brute-force script (solve.js) with Javascript that would figure out what the last missing HEX character and the multiplier could be. Script should output the secret phrase, missing last character and the multiplier used.

## Other information
- Known Data: 36 character HEX string in the correct sequence: E79E349B1D340E117B0E313ADE3AE144A4A6
- Limitations: Assume that the multiplier is a number from 1 to 10.
- Javascript should use BigInt for calculations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1499749307"&gt;Letting AI do it's thing!&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, all I have to do is use Cline and let it work with Gemini to figure it out! I simply attach the Agent.md file and type "Begin!" in the prompt and it went on it's business!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Devtoberfest2025-vibe-coding-solution-screenshot.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/332446iC3A56140A4090C73/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Devtoberfest2025-vibe-coding-solution-screenshot.png" alt="Devtoberfest2025-vibe-coding-solution-screenshot.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1303235802"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Thinking breakdown&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1106722297"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It took about 1minute and identified like 5 tasks/steps.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first API Request costs $0.0309 - .&lt;BR /&gt;This is the full thinking block.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-container"&gt;&lt;a class="lia-spoiler-link" href="#" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;noscript&gt; (Highlight to read)&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-border"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-content"&gt;Thinking&lt;BR /&gt;**Examining the Hexadecimal** I've been poring over this hexadecimal string, meticulously dissecting each component. Initially, my focus centered on identifying patterns and potential relationships between the characters. The user desires a JavaScript solution, so I am brainstorming suitable techniques for manipulating the data.**Devising a Strategy** I'm now formulating a plan to tackle this scavenger hunt puzzle, focusing on a JavaScript implementation. My initial steps involve crafting a `solve.js` script to handle the hexadecimal manipulation and decoding. I'm focusing on how the multiplier interacts with the 37-character string. The ambiguity around its role led me to hypothesize it acts on a number converted from the hex string, which produces a final 38-character hex value to decode.**Defining the Approach** I've outlined the JavaScript script, `solve.js`. The core will be a nested loop: the outer iterates hex characters (0-F), the inner, multipliers (1-10). Within, I'll build the 37-character string, convert to BigInt, multiply, and convert back to hex. A length check on the resulting hex string will signal a potentially valid path. Next I'll translate the hex string to ASCII to see if it yields a readable phrase, using a regex test for printable characters. ``` ```**Developing the Algorithm** I've got the brute-force script (`solve.js`) underway. I've laid out the basic structure: nested loops for the missing hex character and the multiplier, as previously described. I'm focusing on the `BigInt` conversion and the subsequent multiplication and hex conversion. I'm building out the conversion steps and applying an initial check on character length. The code is coming together, and I'm ready to test its initial functionality. I think the biggest problem is to find a regex that will filter strings and check if they're likely to be valid English text. I'll need to research that, as well as the conversion of hex to ASCII and verify the results of the conversion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-container"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-content"&gt;Thinking**Examining the Hexadecimal** I've been poring over this hexadecimal string, meticulously dissecting each component.

findSecret();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Writing this blog post took longer than solving the puzzle with AI. And yes - that's a fact! - HAHA!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Could I have figured out the script on my own??? Yes, but given that I am always in between things or multitasking and I am definitely NOT a Javascript/Python expert, it would very likely have taken me at a minimum an hour to get this script right. That's my estimation on my skillset. I'm sure some of you will code much much faster.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;But - the real lessons learnt here is that, I took about 15mins to give AI the task in a structured way and it only took a mere 60 seconds (no kidding!!) and $0.05 in API costs to generate the script and found the solution. Of course, I do consider that this might also just be luck because it so happened that my assumption of the multiplier being 1 - 10 fell in between the range and there were no other matching phrases found before getting to the 5 multiplier or earlier HEX digits.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Final thoughts - is AI going to replace all developers? Maybe one day... maybe one day... BUT for now, learning how to leverage all the different AI tools and incorporate it into your day-to-day work, is probably the best skills and investment that you can do for yourself!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Till the next Devtoberfest!!&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;PS: I'd love to hear how the others solve it! Leave a comment or better, create another blog post on how you've solved the puzzle!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TLDR; AI beat the crap out of me and solved the Devtoberfest Scavenger Hunt challenge in a minute while it would have probably taken me 1 hr to do it!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

The SAP Integration Suite enables this by providing a rich set of adapters that ensure secure, scalable, and effortless connectivity between systems. In this blog, I will discuss one of the recently released IBM MQ Adapter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IBM MQ Adapter in SAP CI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;IBM MQ is a secure and reliable messaging solution that enables applications, systems, services, and files to communicate by exchanging messages through queues. It simplifies and accelerates the integration of applications and the sharing of business data across diverse platforms.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The IBM MQ Adapter is available in both sender and receiver modes to streamline message-based workflows and comes in two variants — REST and JMS (Java Message Service).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Features&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The IBM MQ Adapter (JMS variant) provides the following key features:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sender adapter facilitates automatic message delivery via &lt;STRONG&gt;JMS Subscribe&lt;/STRONG&gt; variant and &lt;/SPAN&gt;Supports &lt;STRONG&gt;Persistent&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Non-persistent&lt;/STRONG&gt; message delivery via JMS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supports Transactional JMS Session for data consistency and &lt;STRONG&gt;Byte&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Text&lt;/STRONG&gt; JMS messages.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Provides multiple actions for failed transaction handling: &lt;STRONG&gt;Keep the Message&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;and Process&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Again&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;Move to Another Queue&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Receiver adapter allows reliable publishing of messages to &lt;STRONG&gt;Topics&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Queues&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Supports multiple authentications: &lt;STRONG&gt;Basic&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Client Certificate&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;None&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Practical Use Case Walkthrough&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here we will demonstrate how to write employee data (sending it as a message) to a queue on the IBM MQ server using &lt;STRONG&gt;IBM MQ Receiver adapter&lt;/STRONG&gt; and read the message from the queue with help of the &lt;STRONG&gt;IBM MQ Sender Adapter&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IBM MQ JMS Receiver Adapter: Write Employee Data to a Queue&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Architecture for IBM MQ Receiver adapter&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the IBM MQ Adapter is used as a receiver adapter, SAP Integration Suite acts as the initiator of the calls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Suite tenant sends the operation request to IBM MQ (this is a receiver system), IBM MQ Receiver Adapter works on the request and sends the data back using JMS protocol to the SAP Integration Suite tenant.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Shubh5_1-1761220638136.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/331558i2D31FF4B78E3833A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Shubh5_1-1761220638136.png" alt="Shubh5_1-1761220638136.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prepare Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the Content Modifier, you can define employee details, such as names, &lt;/SPAN&gt;organization&lt;SPAN&gt;, role, and salary.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;EmployeeId: EMP1005

It makes it easier to connect IBM MQ systems running in your own data centre with cloud-based systems. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It enables reliable, event-driven messaging and supports robust integration scenarios across hybrid landscapes across both cloud and on-premise setups. As companies grow and update their IT systems, this adapter helps keep everything connected and secure.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Quick Links&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For information about IBM MQ adapter configuration, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/ibm-mq-adapter?locale=zh-CN?locale=zh-CN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help | IBM MQ Adapter&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For detailed information about the IBM MQ adapter, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/package/IBMMQAdapterforSAPIntegrationSuite/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;IBM MQ Adapter Guide&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note: The IBM MQ adapter is available as part of your SAP Integration Suite license.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Labels&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/bg-p/technology-blog-sap/label-name/technology%20updates%E2%80%8B" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology Updates&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;​&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/tag/IBMMQ%20JMS/tg-p/board-id/technology-blog-sap" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IBMMQ JMS&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;October is coming to an end, and that means it’s time for another recap of everything that’s been happening across the SAP Community!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;Everyone is looking forward to SAP TechEd in Berlin, but the past two weeks have already given us a taste of so many exciting things happening throughout the SAP ecosystem. Did you take part in Devtoberfest? This online event was remarkable and full of insights! &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;There’s been plenty of on-site action too, from SAP Inside Tracks and Stammtisch meetups bringing members together locally, to the launch of the Argentina location group. We are happy to see our SAP connections grow even further.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;Let’s dive in and see what’s new!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Featured blog posts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) Planning and Reporting&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP’s member &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1661359" target="_self"&gt;Tano Breutner&lt;/A&gt; shared valuable insights on the importance and limitations of the Version Dimension in SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) Planning. He explains that, although some recommendations suggest simplifying the model by using a single version member and managing versions through a custom public dimension, he prefers to use the version dimension as it was intended. In his blog post, Tano points out that the version dimension has certain restrictions. Therefore, he encourages users to support SAP’s Customer Influence initiatives to help make the version dimension more flexible and public in future updates.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/sac-planning-amp-reporting-the-version-dimension-and-its-limitations/ba-p/14244725" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Read the blog post here&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Update for the SAP BTP trial community&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;Due to an unusually high amount of misuse limiting the availability for all users, the SAP BTP trial product team announced the temporary restriction in the system. &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/44516" target="_blank"&gt;SAP´s Carolin Boeke&lt;/A&gt;, explained that for the next weeks, the SAP BTP trial will not be able to deliver this experience for new SAP BTP trial accounts, to prioritize security. You will still be able to build applications and preview them, but deployment in the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry runtime will not be possible for the next few weeks. Although, if you have an existing account that was created before October 15th, you are not affected. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/btp-trial-update-cf-runtime-availability/ba-p/14247240" target="_blank"&gt;Read the blog post here&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;How to Launch your Data Science Platform with SAP Business Data Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP’s member &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1431336" target="_self"&gt;Joelle Strubel&lt;/A&gt; outlines how to activate SAP Datasphere with SAP Databricks within the SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC) architecture. She clarifies that SAP Databricks uses its own object store, separate from the BDC Object Store, which will not be activated in this setup to preserve data semantics. This step-by-step guide is very straightforward, and she uploaded images to help you visualize better. Make sure to check it out and try it!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/launch-your-data-science-platform-with-sap-business-data-cloud/ba-p/14250546" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Read the blog post here&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition: Guide on How to Drive more Business outcomes&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;If you are looking for a way to get more out of your subscription investment, this recommendation blog post by SAP’s&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/125232" target="_self"&gt; Marco Valencia&lt;/A&gt; is a must-read. He goes over some initiatives based on his personal experience, including the use of Release Assessment and Scope Dependency for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, the exploration of the SAP RASD Tool for SAP Business AI (e.g., SAP Joule), the Manage News Fiori application in the My Home page, and much more. Read the full details of each one of his key points and find some valuable insights for your new projects and business rollouts.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/drive-more-business-outcomes-out-of-your-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-a/ba-p/14252927" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Read the blog post here&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Community News&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Josh “Bluebeard” explain the 9 things you need to know about SAP Community at SAP TechEd in Berlin&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We have been waiting all year and now the SAP TechEd in Berlin is almost here! This conference is not just another tech event, but like &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/148" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Josh Bentley (or “Bluebeard”)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; described: “It´s where SAP Community comes home!” With that, he prepared a list of the 9 things you should know to have the most out of this experience. His main keynotes are Connect at the Community Clubhouse, Dive into the Developer Garage, Learn from Experts, Explore the Community Theatre, Learning and Certification Opportunities, Step into SAP TechEd Experience Center, Get to Know the SAP Community Platform, Connect with Mentors and Champions and Don´t Miss the Developer Keynote. Please, make sure to read his &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-teched-blog-posts/9-things-you-need-to-know-about-sap-community-at-sap-teched-in-berlin/ba-p/14244774" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;full blog post here&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for more details of each one of his recommendations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Get Certified at SAP TechEd!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Like we just mentioned on the topic before, one of the main opportunities for our SAP Community members is the chance to learn and get certified. SAP TechEd in Berlin offers a dedicated space to take the certifications on-site. Take a free on-site certification exam for SAP Generative AI Developer and SAP Build Developer in Berlin, Bangalore, or Louisville to validate your skills and stand out with SAP-certified&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;expertise&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

And this week we are more than happy to share &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/17466" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Champion Sandra Solis&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; post about her passion for drawing and painting! Sandra is an ABAP developer from Mexico, and you probably already saw some of her useful tips and insights, but we would like to bring visibility also to her amazing artistic side. She has been using her creativity and techniques with colored pencils, charcoal, watercolor, and even coffee painting for more than 20 years. On her blog post she shared more details on how she started but also some pictures of her work of art. She even painted with coffee portraits of the SAP Developer Advocates. We were completely obsessed with these iconic pieces. Check &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/community-corner-blog-posts/sap-community-hobbies-series-colors-creativity-and-canvases-sandra-sol%C3%ADs/ba-p/14252046" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;here&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and give Sandra some support for her incredible work in the comments. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New location group: Argentina!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Big news for our SAP community members from South America: we just launched the Argentina group! This is another step on our goal to reach more locations all over the world and bring together SAP experts, students, partners, and every single person that is passionate about SAP topics. The group is run by  &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1491699" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;@MatiasLemos&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/139394" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;@mariano_acevedo&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, and they are more than excited to create this opportunity to expand the connections around Argentina, bring insights and start local events. If you are a member of this area, make sure to &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/argentina/gh-p/argentina" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;register here&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, share, and collaborate with your ideas. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Events&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Devtoberfest 2025: It’s a Wrap!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On October 24, last Friday, we had our last session of Devtoberfest 2025. We would like to appreciate all the developers who helped put this event together and each speaker for their collaboration with the SAP Community.

Last weekend happened the SAP Inside Track in Fortaleza, Brazil, an entire day of online and on-site sessions, networking, special giveaways, and an outstanding music performance to celebrate the local culture. None of this could have been done without the brilliant work of the event organizers and the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1469833" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Champions Jonys Arcanjo&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/140615" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manuel Robalinho&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hello, dear influencers, experts, and friends from the SAP Community!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s finally that time of the year again:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP TechEd Season!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This year feels extra special to me—it’s the first&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP TechEd happening in Germany&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;since I moved here, and I couldn’t be more excited.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When it comes to building my personal TechEd agenda, it has never been both so&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;easy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and so&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;difficult&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;at the same time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why difficult?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Because my curiosity is endless. Over my (long) SAP career, I’ve worked across many areas: from writing ABAP code to designing modern user interfaces, from integration to solution and enterprise architecture—where technology truly meets business. I love exploring how technology and business merge, so naturally, I’d like to attend&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;almost every session&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;across the board.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why easy?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Because priorities are clear this year:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;My laser focus will be on everything around custom AI scenarios—how we as engineers can build AI extensions, create and extend Joule AI agents, and leverage the SAP AI Foundation. I believe many of the new challenges (and opportunities!) will emerge here, and I can’t wait to discover how SAP’s newest innovations will empower us.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That said, I’ve shortlisted around&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;30 sessions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;I’d love to attend. Realistically, some I’ll have to catch later via SAP TechEd Virtual—but here are my&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Top 3 “must-watch” sessions&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1892897341"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1892839589" id="toc-hId-1696383836"&gt;My Top 3 SAP TechEd 2025 Sessions&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1752309231180001RW3M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CT1245 | Hugging Face Transformers in AI Foundation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I’m learning to use Hugging Face models, so I’m curious to see how they work within the SAP AI Foundation. This feels like a new&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;superpower&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for building advanced AI scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1749827524991001reiY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI160 | Build your own AI agent–based solution with the generative AI hub&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Agents are another game-changing technology. Spending two hours diving deep into building custom AI agents to extend SAP products sounds like time very well invested.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1753117990922001Td7z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;PAR102 | From MCP to Joule: Unlocking SAP data and AI innovation with Microsoft&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I’ve been exploring how SAP AI Foundation can be integrated with cloud providers beyond the Generative AI Hub. This session will be a great opportunity to hear directly from Microsoft experts on their approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bonus:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1749827695218001gVai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI101 | Optimize prompts and explore models with the generative AI hub&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Prompt engineering is one of the core skills for creating effective custom AI solutions. This session promises plenty of practical insights to sharpen that skill.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;Of course, I wish I could attend everything—but thankfully, many sessions will be available later via&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/virtual.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP TechEd Virtual&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition to the AI-focused ones, I’ll also keep a close eye on all sessions related to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule in the context of ABAP and CAP development&lt;/STRONG&gt;—because at the end of the day, AI custom scenarios often start right there (with a little help from Python).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1696326084" id="toc-hId-1499870331"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To all my fellow SAP Community colleagues:&lt;BR /&gt;I wish you an inspiring and knowledge-packed SAP TechEd season. May your curiosity be fueled and your learning appetite at least partly satisfied.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s keep in touch and exchange our learnings in the weeks to come.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;All the best,&lt;BR /&gt;Douglas&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1764557512"&gt;🧩 Este conteúdo é diferente do que você costuma ver aqui no meu perfil, mas é essencial para qualquer profissional.&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hoje não vou falar de SAP ou Integração no SAP CPI. Vou falar sobre algo que impacta diretamente sua carreira: a forma como você se comporta, se comunica, lida com pessoas e reage a situações.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tudo isso está ligado à sua &lt;STRONG&gt;inteligência emocional&lt;/STRONG&gt;. E ela pode ser o fator decisivo entre crescer ou estagnar na sua trajetória profissional.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Neste artigo, quero compartilhar com você uma reflexão sobre &lt;STRONG&gt;QI x QE&lt;/STRONG&gt;, como isso afeta seu dia a dia no trabalho e na família, e como a ferramenta &lt;STRONG&gt;DISC&lt;/STRONG&gt; pode te ajudar a evoluir como profissional.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":briefcase:"&gt;💼&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Não há dúvida de que, para termos sucesso na vida profissional, precisamos desenvolver habilidades. E normalmente, o foco está nas &lt;STRONG&gt;habilidades cognitivas&lt;/STRONG&gt;, como fazer uma faculdade, aprender inglês, fazer cursos… tudo isso relacionado ao nosso &lt;STRONG&gt;QI (Coeficiente de Inteligência)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;E sim, isso é importante!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mas… &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":thinking_face:"&gt;🤔&lt;/span&gt; E se eu te disser que essas habilidades representam apenas 20% do que você precisa para conquistar o sucesso?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1568044007"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":books:"&gt;📚&lt;/span&gt;O que realmente faz a diferença: o QE&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Segundo &lt;STRONG&gt;Daniel Goleman&lt;/STRONG&gt;, PhD em Psicologia e autor do livro &lt;EM&gt;"Inteligência Emocional"&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;80% do sucesso&lt;/STRONG&gt; está diretamente relacionado ao &lt;STRONG&gt;QE (Coeficiente de Inteligência Emocional)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ou seja, o que mais te impede de alcançar o sucesso não é o que você &lt;STRONG&gt;SABE&lt;/STRONG&gt;, mas o que você &lt;STRONG&gt;FAZ&lt;/STRONG&gt; (ou deixa de &lt;STRONG&gt;FAZER&lt;/STRONG&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371530502"&gt;🧩 Diferença entre QI e QE&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Vamos organizar isso de forma simples e clara. Veja essa tabela comparativa:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1304099716"&gt;Resumo Comparativo&amp;nbsp; entre QI e QE&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Resumo" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336677i30B7A0148E907D56/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="neylonSilva_0-1762369225042.png" alt="Resumo" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Resumo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cada habilidade é desenvolvida e utilizada de forma diferente.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;O &lt;STRONG&gt;QI&lt;/STRONG&gt; representa o nosso &lt;STRONG&gt;SABER&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enquanto o &lt;STRONG&gt;QE&lt;/STRONG&gt; está ligado ao &lt;STRONG&gt;FAZER&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;O QI se desenvolve com o tempo: engatinhar, sentar, andar, falar… Já o QE nasce de estímulos, experiências e observações. Ele está profundamente conectado ao sentimento: o que importa não é o que aconteceu, mas como você &lt;STRONG&gt;se SENTIU&lt;/STRONG&gt; diante da experiência.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ah, então Neylon, você está dizendo que eu posso abandonar as habilidades cognitivas?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;— Claro que não! Se você fizer isso, não vai alcançar sucesso.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-978503492"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":high_voltage:"&gt;⚡&lt;/span&gt;Saber não é suficiente&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Vamos sair um pouco do ambiente profissional para entender melhor:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":cigarette:"&gt;🚬&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fumar faz mal?&lt;/STRONG&gt; Todo mundo SABE que sim. Mesmo assim, muitos continuam. Por quê? Porque não é o QI que impede, é o QE. Existe um vício, sim, mas também há uma carga emocional que dificulta a mudança.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;🏃‍&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":male_sign:"&gt;♂️&lt;/span&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Fazer exercícios faz bem?&lt;/STRONG&gt; Também todo mundo SABE. Mas nem todo mundo FAZ. O problema não é o cognitivo, é o emocional.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;Ou seja, muitas vezes o problema não é &lt;STRONG&gt;SABER o que FAZER&lt;/STRONG&gt;, é conseguir &lt;STRONG&gt;FAZER o que SABE&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;Isso mostra que, na vida, muitas vezes você SABE o que precisa fazer, mas não faz. Isso deixa claro que seu lado cognitivo, dado por Deus, funciona perfeitamente, mas suas habilidades emocionais ainda não foram desenvolvidas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781989987"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":briefcase:"&gt;💼&lt;/span&gt;E no trabalho?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Você SABE que não deve gritar com colegas, ser ríspido, ignorar opiniões... Mas mesmo sabendo, às vezes você FAZ.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Isso é falta de QI? Não. É sua &lt;STRONG&gt;inteligência emocional&lt;/STRONG&gt; que precisa ser desenvolvida.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;🧓 "Ah Neylon, mas muito disso é falta de MATURIDADE, com o tempo a pessoa aprende!"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;— Não, &lt;STRONG&gt;maturidade não vem com o tempo&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Se fosse assim, não veríamos pessoas mais velhas cometendo os mesmos erros repetidamente. A maturidade é uma &lt;STRONG&gt;habilidade emocional&lt;/STRONG&gt;, não apenas cognitiva. Isso explica por que existem pessoas mais velhas sem maturidade.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-585476482"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":pensive_face:"&gt;😔&lt;/span&gt;Por que tanta gente está frustrada no trabalho?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Uma pessoa gosta de explicar tudo com detalhes. Seu colega, mais direto, acha isso desnecessário. Resultado? Frustração.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Um chefe é objetivo e direto. O colaborador sente isso como falta de empatia. Resultado? Mais frustração.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;João teve um dia ruim e respondeu Pedro de forma ríspida. Pedro ficou chateado, mas João nem percebeu (ou percebeu e ignorou). O que importa aqui não foi a fala em si, mas como &lt;STRONG&gt;PEDRO se SENTIU&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":direct_hit:"&gt;🎯&lt;/span&gt;O que é comum e normal para você pode ser interpretado de forma totalmente diferente por outra pessoa.&lt;/STRONG&gt;E isso acontece no trabalho, em casa, na vida.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-388962977"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":magnifying_glass_tilted_left:"&gt;🔍&lt;/span&gt;E como melhorar isso?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;O primeiro passo é o &lt;STRONG&gt;autoconhecimento&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A ferramenta &lt;STRONG&gt;DISC&lt;/STRONG&gt; ajuda você a entender seu perfil comportamental — como você age, reage, se comunica, e também como se relaciona com quem é diferente de você.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Perfil Neylon Silva" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336678iBE3C3374F04536F0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="neylonSilva_0-1762369360853.png" alt="Perfil Neylon Silva" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Perfil Neylon Silva&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-192449472"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":bar_chart:"&gt;📊&lt;/span&gt;Os 4 perfis do DISC (resumido)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dominante:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Autoconfiante, direto, orientado a resultados&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Influente:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Comunicativo, entusiasmado, envolvente&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Estável:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Calmo, paciente, cooperativo&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analítico:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Cauteloso, preciso, gosta de detalhes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--4064033"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":handshake:"&gt;🤝&lt;/span&gt;Quer saber mais?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":briefcase:"&gt;💼&lt;/span&gt;Você pode ser excelente tecnicamente, mas se não souber lidar com pessoas, pressões e frustrações, vai acabar travando seu próprio crescimento.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Espero que esse conteúdo tenha te feito refletir. Se quiser conversar mais sobre &lt;STRONG&gt;inteligência emocional&lt;/STRONG&gt; ou aplicar a análise DISC na sua equipe, estou à disposição.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Afinal, tecnologia leva você longe, mas comportamento leva você além. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":rocket:"&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Injured but thriving nevertheless&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="TomCenens_1-1762635628524.png" style="width: 341px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337522iCF97A50BC9686AB0/image-dimensions/341x611/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="341" height="611" role="button" title="TomCenens_1-1762635628524.png" alt="TomCenens_1-1762635628524.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Coming back from SAP TechEd 2025 in Berlin, I found myself being wheelchaired out of Zaventem Airport in Belgium. My inflamed Achilles tendon had worsened over the course of the event.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I probably should have been resting, but I was determined to be there. Between participating in the DemoJam finals, giving a presentation, meeting with SAP leadership through the SAP Mentors program, and reconnecting with so many community members, SAP Champions, and fellow Mentors, missing it simply wasn’t an option.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By the end, I could barely walk. I managed to push through for a few days, but eventually my body said, &lt;EM&gt;“enough is enough,”&lt;/EM&gt; and it quite literally shut down on the last day of SAP TechEd.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even at what could be seen as a low point, I couldn’t stop smiling because the experience, the people, and the inspiration made it all worth it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Caretakers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A huge thank you to &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafkemagic?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAArGSQB5XqHhDXwKL3ZuUP85HrGWfiZT6s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Raf B.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; for wheeling me out of the airport, and to &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janadk?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAXBh28BEHKMvW3_9Q_y1vMKgwU6SpLc-AA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Jana de Klerk&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; for taking such great care of me throughout the event. From fetching ice to taking me to the medical post at SAP TechEd. Also, sincere thanks to &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremycoppey?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAYRF6EBVD9RxCuZ--ZsRggEoe3W0m_ksaI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Jérémy Coppey&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wouterlemaire?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAYQ-fkBPUGRBNItEIe5c1yGgHIwNnBwvDU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Wouter Lemaire&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; for all their help and for carrying my things around when I couldn’t.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m truly grateful for the amazing friends I have and for all the support they gave me when I needed it most.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP TechED DemoJam 2025 winners&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="TomCenens_2-1762635628538.png" style="width: 367px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337521iA3B83D7BAFD2B23C/image-dimensions/367x511/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="367" height="511" role="button" title="TomCenens_2-1762635628538.png" alt="TomCenens_2-1762635628538.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the absolute highlights for me and a new all-time high was &lt;STRONG&gt;winning the SAP DemoJam 2025 final at SAP TechEd in Berlin&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Wouter and I had a blast presenting our use case. Our goal was to show that developing with the latest SAP technologies and sharing what we build can be &lt;EM&gt;great fun&lt;/EM&gt;. We both love the community spirit and feel proud to be an active part of it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our demo was based on a real Artificial Intelligence use case for Infrabel (Belgium), powered by a wide range of SAP technologies behind the scenes. The idea came from automating some of my own recurring system monitoring tasks. In other words, turning a practical challenge into an innovative solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To make it engaging, we turned it into a friendly battle: I performed the tasks the “old-fashioned” way, while Wouter used the AI-driven application we had built. With a touch of humor and a lot of energy, we managed to deliver a DemoJam that truly resonated with the audience: blending lighthearted banter with serious SAP innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Team efforts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’d like to thank our customer &lt;STRONG&gt;Infrabel&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the opportunity to work with the latest SAP technologies. A special thanks to &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinverzele?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAD1B8EBcFDfEUtqHTL-h2HvTw0XCuVWRSU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Kevin Verzele&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; and to everyone in the team who supported us among others, &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brieuc-bernard?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAACmU3XoBfkPJQb02jygbBO5lCu6blg7YRkg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Brieuc Bernard&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABDv9gQBYd04CtSsqpkRBb0KZfEZtGNls34?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAABDv9gQBYd04CtSsqpkRBb0KZfEZtGNls34" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tom Van de Velde&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; . Thank you all!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The trophy will be placed at the customer’s site as a token of appreciation, symbolizing that this achievement was truly a &lt;STRONG&gt;team effort&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Working on the MCP server application &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We had some fascinating discussions with SAP and Microsoft during SAP TechEd about our Artificial Intelligence journey. Specifically around using MCP with SAP S/4HANA data. These conversations sparked fresh ideas and inspired us to push the boundaries of what’s currently possible. Needless to say, we spent at least one evening in our Airbnb apartment exploring those new possibilities even further.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'll give you a quick example of a pump comparison. The product has been fetched from actual SAP product data and is then compared against other pumps by combining SAP S/4 HANA data with online data. This is just a quick showcase snippet. I'll write up another article to detail this out further.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="TomCenens_3-1762635628544.png" style="width: 695px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337520iD5CCAB3C97FA2D15/image-dimensions/695x452/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="695" height="452" role="button" title="TomCenens_3-1762635628544.png" alt="TomCenens_3-1762635628544.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There was a lot of "MCP" visible on architectural slides and announcements in terms of support for MCP and in terms of SAP making use of MCP which showed that MCP is the new kid on the block and the "hotness" right now when it comes to Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Mentors&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="TomCenens_4-1762635628555.jpeg" style="width: 491px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337523i461236B3FB06DBEF/image-dimensions/491x625/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="491" height="625" role="button" title="TomCenens_4-1762635628555.jpeg" alt="TomCenens_4-1762635628555.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The SAP Mentor program has, without a doubt, had a profound impact on my professional journey.&lt;/STRONG&gt; It continues to be a tremendous source of inspiration. Surrounded by so many brilliant minds and remarkable individuals, I always feel that I’m growing, learning, and thriving whenever we come together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We had really productive discussions with SAP. The kind that keep them on their toes and occasionally challenge their thinking. The goal is to provide an outside perspective that helps SAP continue to improve and evolve.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We very much appreciate the time taken by everyone who meets up with us at these conferences and the candid conversations we have with them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The vision of SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="TomCenens_5-1762635628562.jpeg" style="width: 580px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337524iCBA436D1C07893A8/image-dimensions/580x435/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="580" height="435" role="button" title="TomCenens_5-1762635628562.jpeg" alt="TomCenens_5-1762635628562.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In my view, SAP’s technological vision remains truly impressive. Of course, there are still challenges to overcome but that’s true for every player in the enterprise software space. The current limitations of Artificial Intelligence affect the entire industry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What sets SAP apart is its bold vision and determination to execute on it. They’re not just adopting what already exists; they’re actively thinking ahead, exploring how to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in the context of enterprise software.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’re already in active discussions with SAP on how we can push the needle even further together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Announcements and demo's&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="TomCenens_6-1762635628566.jpeg" style="width: 644px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337525iAC367693400339ED/image-dimensions/644x364/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="644" height="364" role="button" title="TomCenens_6-1762635628566.jpeg" alt="TomCenens_6-1762635628566.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While I truly appreciate SAP’s vision and the technological drive that continues to push boundaries, my heart really jumps for joy when I see live demos on stage. Even if they would fail, I prefer them because they show what’s possible &lt;EM&gt;right now&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, Artificial Intelligence still has its limitations, but it’s incredible to see how much can already be achieved today and how quickly technology continues to evolve.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inspired and fuelled up&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These events are rocket fuel for me. They ignite something that makes me want to push harder and reach further. The inspiration hits so powerfully that here I am, writing on a Saturday night at 9:30 PM, unable to wait.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's like hearing that one song that gives you chills and completely shifts your state of mind.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm back, and I've already spun up a fresh repository to experiment with new ideas and push boundaries. I'm diving deeper into Artificial Intelligence because I genuinely believe we're standing at the beginning of a transformative journey that will propel technology to heights most can't yet imagine in the months ahead.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;See you at SAP TechEd 2026! Something tells me we'll have a lot more to talk about by then.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
