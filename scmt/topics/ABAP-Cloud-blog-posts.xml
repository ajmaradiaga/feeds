    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Currently, official ABAP tool support exists for SAP GUI and Eclipse. For years, users have asked us to bring this support to additional IDEs. Based on the user survey results from 2023 and 2025, the most requested development environment is &lt;STRONG&gt;Visual Studio Code (VS Code)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. However, many users have also expressed interest in other environments such as JetBrains IDEs, Neovim, or even Zed. In short, our user base wants more flexibility when choosing their development environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;See related article:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/abap-development-tools-for-vs-code-everything-you-need-to-know/ba-p/14258129" target="_self"&gt;ABAP Development Tools for VS Code: Everything You Need to Know&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How Do We Transform the ABAP Development Tools Architecture to Offer More Choice?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When analyzing the challenge, we identified two major issues that needed to be addressed:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. The Client/Server Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP tools follow a client/server architecture. For each new development environment, a client layer implementation is required. This layer contains all the code needed to communicate with an ABAP server, including complex wrappers for existing ABAP development tools REST APIs. It ensures compatibility with system releases as far back as SAP NetWeaver 7.3 EHP1 SP04 and higher and implements client-side tool logic such as the debugger, test runner, ATC, tracing, and more.&lt;BR /&gt;Overall, the client UI-independent (IDE independent) codebase consists of &lt;STRONG&gt;2.9 million lines of code&lt;/STRONG&gt;!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Object Type Editors&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP relies heavily on object type editors. For the SAP BTP ABAP development environment alone, &lt;STRONG&gt;88 unique editors&lt;/STRONG&gt; need to be supported as of 2025. For comparison, CAP only requires one unique editor (CDS), and Java tooling only needs editors for classes, interfaces and enumerations.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution 1: Reusing Our Client Codebase as a Language Server&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Modern development environments support language servers through the &lt;A href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Language Server Protocol (LSP)&lt;/A&gt;, which defines a standardized interface between the development tool and the language server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="lsp_example_diagram.png" style="width: 740px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334818iEF95CE78093087A7/image-dimensions/740x343/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="740" height="343" role="button" title="lsp_example_diagram.png" alt="lsp_example_diagram.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;(Image &lt;A href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;source&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This means a language server can be written in any programming language and reused across multiple development environments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We began exploring this approach in 2018, considering a TypeScript based language server to re-implement the client component—similar to community ABAP VS Code extensions. While functional, this approach was not ideal for us because it required rebuilding the entire client layer from scratch and maintaining two separate implementations. This is simply not a viable solution in the long run.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fortunately, we discovered the &lt;A href="https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Java VS Code extension&lt;/A&gt;, which provided a clever solution: they "wrapped" the Eclipse Java development tools with a language server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach allowed them to reuse the existing JDT codebase. Interestingly, most Java developers don’t realize that the VS Code Java extension is essentially Eclipse running inside VS Code!&lt;BR /&gt;This concept solved our problem: we can potentially reuse &lt;STRONG&gt;2.9 million lines of our client non-ui code&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="potential_reuse.png" style="width: 716px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334820i387FA14354C9E2B3/image-dimensions/716x445/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="716" height="445" role="button" title="potential_reuse.png" alt="potential_reuse.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It also means we can maintain and support Eclipse and VS Code using the same codebase. Even better, users can connect to any ABAP server release supported by Eclipse through the VS Code extension.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Solution 2: Making Object Types Reusable via Server-Driven Development and Client-Based Renderers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Initially, when building the Eclipse plug-in, we implemented new object type editors by adding persistence logic on the server in ABAP and the UI on the client side in Java. In 2018, when the SAP BTP ABAP Environment was launched and we decided to only support ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse for ABAP Cloud development, we had to add many missing object types quickly. During this process, we realized our architecture did not scale well. Using two programming languages was too complex and slow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Learning from past experiences, we looked at the server-side Dynpro and SAP Fiori Elements programming models, which allow the implementation of ABAP-based UIs using only ABAP code and a client-side rendering engine based on UI models.&lt;BR /&gt;Adopting this approach solved our scalability problem: we only need &lt;STRONG&gt;two rendering engines&lt;/STRONG&gt; for tool support—one for form-based tools and one for source-based tools.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="server_driven_before_after.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/334819iC5951153882F0337/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="server_driven_before_after.png" alt="server_driven_before_after.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 2020, we released editor support for number range objects—our first server-driven object type. Today, all new object types are built using our server-driven development framework.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks to this shift, offering ABAP tool support in another development environment no longer requires 88 separate editors. It only requires two:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;One editor for form-based objects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;One editor for source-based objects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For years, we wanted to bring ABAP tools to more development environments, but the previous architecture made this impossible. Over the past six years, we have invested significant effort into re-architecting our tools. Thanks to this work, we can now bring ABAP tools to additional IDEs—starting with &lt;STRONG&gt;VS Code in 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt;!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are excited to announce that we have started working on a VS Code extension for ABAP. We understand that the community has high expectations, and we want to communicate transparently about what you can expect from ABAP Development Tools for VS Code. In this article, we will share details about the scope of the first release and what’s planned for the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;See related article:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/behind-the-design-how-we-transformed-the-abap-development-tools/ba-p/14258121" target="_self"&gt;Behind the Design: How We Transformed the ABAP Development Tools Architecture to Support More IDEs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Primary focus will be support for the ABAP Cloud Development Model&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The goal is to fully support all developer flows related to the ABAP Cloud development model. It is not planned to support classic programming models such as Dynpro or Web Dynpro.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scope of the First Release: Focus on RAP UI Services&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The primary focus of the initial release is the development of RAP UI services. One of the biggest requests from our users has been to bring SAP Fiori frontend development and RAP UI service development into the same tool. We know this group of developers will benefit the most when all development tasks can be performed within VS Code. That’s why this is the starting point.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;First Release Targeted at Early Adopters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The initial set of object types will include everything needed to build a RAP UI service from scratch, along with the basic develop/test/debug flow that VS Code supports. This includes editors for classes and interfaces. We plan to ship around 12+ object types. However, for many tasks outside of development flows for creating RAP UI services, developers will still need to switch between ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse and ABAP Development Tools for VS Code.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP developer tools for VS Code will gradually catch up with ABAP developer tools for Eclipse one Client Release at a Time&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It took us 16 years to reach the current feature scope of the Eclipse plug-in. The technical implementation of our VS Code extension uses an architecture that allows us to reuse much of the existing Eclipse codebase. However, we must migrate all existing tools to the Language Server Protocol and design/build the necessary UIs on the VS Code side. While we expect a much faster development timeline, this transition will not happen overnight but gradually with each new client release.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Same Backend Support as ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since we are reusing our existing codebase, all features available for a given release in Eclipse can potentially be offered in VS Code. We plan to support all releases down to SAP NetWeaver 7.3 EHP1 SP04.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Early Release Means You Can Help Shape the Roadmap&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Just like the Eclipse plug-in, which was not feature-complete when we started, we will actively engage with the ABAP developer community to help us prioritize the features you miss the most.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;File-based development first&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As the name already implies Visual Studio Code is a code editor optimized for editing source code files. Additionally, all AI tools work best in a file-based environment. In order, to ensure that ABAP developers get the most out of VS Code in combination with AI tools all object type editing is completely file based utilizing the &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;ABAP file formats&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule for Developers Features Coming to VS Code&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are planning to bring the Joule for developers features to VS Code, including predictive code completion and other intelligent development capabilities.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Development Tools for VS Code Unlock Access to Cutting-Edge AI Tools&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the reasons ABAP in VS Code is so appealing is that most cutting-edge AI development innovations happen in VS Code. Thanks to the new extension, you can leverage the available AI VS Code extensions. Please note that ABAP development objects are still stored on the server side. The file system had to be implemented using the “virtual workspace” technology. Not all AI tools currently support this file system, so compatibility may vary.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;At SAP TechEd 2025, we announced four key innovations that redefine the ABAP Cloud development experience:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2022695882"&gt;Key highlights:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP is entering the era of Agentic AI&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP LLMs will be available on GenAI Hub&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP AI capabilities will be supported in earlier releases (SAP S/4HANA Private Edition 2021 and later)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP is embracing an open IDE strategy — with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for ABAP on the way&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These innovations mark a major step forward in making ABAP development even more intelligent, flexible, and efficient.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Generative AI has already profoundly changed our world. The arrival of Agentic AI marks the beginning of a major technological transformation. We are entering a new era. For enterprise development, this means rethinking the very foundations of our programming models while upholding SAP’s core commitments to security, scalability, and reliability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At SAP TechEd 2025, the spotlight is on how AI and Agentic capabilities are revolutionizing ABAP development. By embracing these advancements, developers can unlock intelligent automation, boost productivity, and build smarter, more resilient enterprise solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1438934220"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1242420715"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A New Era for ABAP Development&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP is evolving alongside rapid advances in AI and development tooling. With these new innovations, we are extending the reach of ABAP AI, enabling agentic development, and delivering a modern, IDE-agnostic experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174989929"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-978476424"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP - Now Powered by Agentic AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, ABAP AI capabilities are available as individual Joule skills, offering valuable automation and insights to developers. To further enhance the development workflow and unlock new levels of productivity, we are introducing Agents for ABAP. All agents will be able to interact with one another through a new Agentic AI architecture in ABAP’s backbone technology components. With this innovation, ABAP coding agents will actively assist developers throughout the entire development process — from code generation to refactoring and transformation — enabling seamless end-to-end automation and agentic collaboration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 16.51.31.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336120i8A72AA62BB3C63E2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 16.51.31.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 16.51.31.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A new &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP MCP server&lt;/STRONG&gt; will expose ABAP development capabilities, both with and without embedded AI, to agents. Existing ABAP AI use cases will be refined and offered as tools or as dedicated ABAP agents via MCP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine an ABAP development experience where intelligent agents actively support you every step of the way—boosting productivity and accelerating development tasks through smart, agentic assistance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;General availability is planned for &lt;STRONG&gt;Q2, 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The initial scope focuses on &lt;STRONG&gt;VS Code for ABAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, with &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse&lt;/STRONG&gt; to follow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781962919"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-585449414"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP AI LLMs on GenAI Hub &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To empower customers and partners to &lt;STRONG&gt;build custom, AI-driven developer productivity use cases&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we will make our ABAP AI large language models (LLMs) available on the GenAI Hub.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Trained on more than 250 million lines of ABAP code, 30 million lines of CDS code, and extensive technical documentation, these LLMs are purpose-built to &lt;STRONG&gt;explain&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;generate&lt;/STRONG&gt; (ghost text) &lt;STRONG&gt;modern ABAP code&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Release is planned for &lt;STRONG&gt;Q4 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;, underscoring our commitment to openness and collaboration within the SAP ecosystem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-388935909"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-192422404"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Availability of ABAP AI Capabilities in Lower Releases&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-254074337"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(SAP S/4HANA Private Edition&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2021, 2022, and 2023)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI-driven development is transforming how organizations extend SAP S/4HANA. To make AI available more broadly, ABAP AI capabilities will soon be offered for&lt;STRONG&gt; SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt; From a technology perspective, we will follow a release independent approach by offering ABAP AI capabilities as an application that can be deployed side-by-side.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This allows ABAP developers in S/4HANA systems to increase productivity, accelerate custom code transformation, and continuously access the latest capabilities — all while keeping their core system stable. The real strength of this new ABAP AI application is that it will be combined with the Agentic AI tooling described above.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;General availability is planned for &lt;STRONG&gt;Q2 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt;, marking a significant milestone in making AI innovation more accessible to every S/4HANA customer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-146649751"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--49863754"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;VS Code for ABAP is coming&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To meet developers where they are, &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Cloud development &lt;/STRONG&gt;is coming to Visual Studio Code — one of the world’s most widely used IDEs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ABAPinVSCode_TechEd25_Public_Picture.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336182iC2885AE9514C9592/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ABAPinVSCode_TechEd25_Public_Picture.png" alt="ABAPinVSCode_TechEd25_Public_Picture.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Cloud Extension for VS Code&lt;/STRONG&gt; delivers a streamlined, file-based development experience with built-in AI assistance. It is powered by an ABAP language server, initially supporting Fiori UI Service development and expanding to additional ABAP Cloud scenarios over time.&lt;BR /&gt;This move brings ABAP development into the same environment where developers already build with &lt;STRONG&gt;UI5 and CAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enabling a unified, AI-enhanced experience across SAP technologies. Eclipse for ABAP will remain our flagship IDE for full-fledged ABAP development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;General availability is planned for &lt;STRONG&gt;Q2, 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--246377259"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--149487757"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Join the Future of ABAP Development&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;These four innovations mark a major step toward a unified, intelligent, and modern ABAP development experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With Agentic AI, release-independent ABAP AI capabilities, and VS Code for ABAP, we’re redefining how developers create intelligent enterprise solutions with ABAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Learn more about the new developments in ABAP &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/abap/environment.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1635568966"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sometimes&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;there is the requirement to use field names that are reserved words such as &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;Number&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;Begin&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; or other reserved words as a propery property name of your OData service, e.g. to fill the value of a dynamic tile.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1439055461"&gt;Implementation&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;When trying to set this name as an alias in your CDS view this fails with the error message:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;NUMBER is a reserved word (choose another field name)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@AbapCatalog.viewEnhancementCategory: [#NONE]

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The SAP Business Application Studio provides several extensions designed to streamline the development of business applications for the SAP Intelligent Enterprise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Among these extensions is the &lt;STRONG&gt;CDS Graphical Modeler&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which enables SAP business developers to visually design Core Data Service (CDS) models. Previously, this extension was available for SAP Cloud Application Programming (CAP) development projects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, with the release of SAP BTP ABAP environment 2508 and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508, corresponding to ABAP release 9.16, &lt;STRONG&gt;we have integrated the CDS Graphical Modeler with ABAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This integration allows developers to create ABAP projects using the CDS Graphical Modeler to conveniently design ABAP-compliant CDS models for various scenarios in a remote ABAP system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ultimately, you can now build &lt;STRONG&gt;full-stack ABAP applications in SAP Business Application Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Once you've created an ABAP project, you can model business objects, generate ABAP CDS artifacts, integrate a user interface, and deploy your application to the appropriate environments, such as SAP BTP ABAP environment or SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Curious how this works? Check out our documentation on SAP Help Portal for detailed instructions: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/developing-full-stack-abap-application-in-sap-business-application-studio-40adaba361e2469493d47bf9757e87c7/developing-full-stack-abap-application-in-sap-business-application-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Develop Full-Stack ABAP Applications in SAP Business Application Studio&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But you’re short on time or just looking for a quick peek? Keep reading!&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Set Up Your Full-Stack ABAP Project:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the SAP Build Lobby, choose&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;right above the project list and select&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the drop-down menu. This opens the &lt;STRONG&gt;Create Project&lt;/STRONG&gt; dialog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Project creation screen with options for Application, Automated Process, and Business Site, highlighting Application with a &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; button." style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338097iB0492A95FD78BB48/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Lobby_ProjectObjective.png" alt="Project creation screen with options for Application, Automated Process, and Business Site, highlighting Application with a &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; button." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Project creation screen with options for Application, Automated Process, and Business Site, highlighting Application with a "Next" button.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create Project&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;dialog, select&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application&lt;/STRONG&gt;, click&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Next&lt;/STRONG&gt;, select&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Full-Stack&lt;/STRONG&gt;, advance with&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Next&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and finally select&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Full-Stack ABAP (SAP Business Application Studio)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="&amp;quot;Full-Stack ABAP (SAP Business Application Studio)&amp;quot; option is selected for creating a project with a &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; button available." style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338100iBB2258CE34BD4209/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Lobby_ProjectType.png" alt="&amp;quot;Full-Stack ABAP (SAP Business Application Studio)&amp;quot; option is selected for creating a project with a &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; button available." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;"Full-Stack ABAP (SAP Business Application Studio)" option is selected for creating a project with a "Next" button available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Advance with&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Next&lt;/STRONG&gt; and specify the target ABAP system and configure the project details.&lt;BR /&gt;Once the project is created, a &lt;STRONG&gt;Core Schema Notation Model&lt;/STRONG&gt; is created in the remote ABAP system, and the remote ABAP package path is added to the workspace. The project then opens in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Storyboard&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Model Your Application:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the &lt;STRONG&gt;Storyboard&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you can model your ABAP application using the CDS Graphical Modeler to define and visualize your ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) business objects, projections, and services relevant to your application development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Storyboard offers options to create a business object, projection, service, or UI application with corresponding plus buttons." style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338101iF12DC88B69EC925A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="GraphicalModeler_Storyboard.png" alt="Storyboard offers options to create a business object, projection, service, or UI application with corresponding plus buttons." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Storyboard offers options to create a business object, projection, service, or UI application with corresponding plus buttons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;+&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create an entity&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; field to add the business object entities and define their relationship for the business service.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Next to the Business Object modeler, you see your CSN file. This file resides on your ABAP system in the package you created previously. This file is used by the modeler to store your model. You should not edit this file manually since this can damage the integrity of the model.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Proceed with adding projections to specify which elements of a business object are exposed in the business service.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Add a business service and select which entities to expose in the service.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Storyboard shows the relation of business objects, projections, and services and an option to create a new UI application." style="width: 997px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338105iDBECCDDEF4D33B4F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="GraphicalModeler.png" alt="Storyboard shows the relation of business objects, projections, and services and an option to create a new UI application." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Storyboard shows the relation of business objects, projections, and services and an option to create a new UI application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You are now all set to generate the ABAP backend artefacts from the modeled business objects, projections, and services. Close the Business Services modeler and return to the Storyboard.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Generate ABAP CDS Artifacts:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once you have modeled your ABAP application, you need to generate the ABAP development objects based on the data model created with the CDS Graphical Modeler, including DDIC tables, CDS views, metadata extensions, and service definitions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the &lt;STRONG&gt;Storyboard&lt;/STRONG&gt;, choose &lt;STRONG&gt;Generate &lt;/STRONG&gt;and follow the steps in the wizard to perform validation checks and complete the generation process.&lt;BR /&gt;As a result, a read-only RAP OData UI service is generated and available in the service catalog. On the ABAP side, the development objects are activated, and the service binding is published.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Add a User Interface and Deploy Your Application:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a last step, you need to create a user interface for your RAP service by generating a&amp;nbsp;SAP Fiori&amp;nbsp;UI application that you can then deploy to an appropriate environment, such as SAP BTP ABAP Environment or SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the &lt;STRONG&gt;Storyboard&lt;/STRONG&gt;, choose &lt;STRONG&gt;+&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the &lt;STRONG&gt;UI Applications&lt;/STRONG&gt; field to open the SAP Fiori Generator wizard and provide the required inputs for your UI development. To deploy the application, choose &lt;STRONG&gt;Deploy&lt;/STRONG&gt; from the &lt;STRONG&gt;Application Information&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And that's it!

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1635652393"&gt;Cloud-Native with ABAP Cloud – The Transactional Outbox Pattern&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cheers ABAP folks!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In modern, distributed system landscapes, ensuring &lt;STRONG&gt;data consistency&lt;/STRONG&gt; between a database and a message broker is a common challenge – especially when it comes to the integration of S/4HANA Cloud with Side-by-Side extensions built on the SAP Business Technology Platform (e.g. SAP BTP ABAP Environment, aka. Steampunk) or any other microservice-based architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;How do you guarantee that a database update (“Order created”) and a corresponding message (like "Request a shipping of the order") are never out of sync? The answer lies in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Transactional Outbox Pattern&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This elegant solution ensures that these two critical operations are treated as a single, atomic unit, which is vital for maintaining data integrity and building robust, event-driven architectures atop SAP's core business processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1568221607"&gt;The Logical Unit of Work&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Logical Unit of Work (LUW) in ABAP represents a series of database operations that are treated as a single, indivisible transaction. All changes made within an LUW, whether updates, insertions, or deletions, must either be &lt;STRONG&gt;committed&lt;/STRONG&gt; to the database successfully &lt;STRONG&gt;or rolled back&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;entirely&lt;/STRONG&gt; if an error occurs, ensuring transactional consistency. This "all or nothing" principle is managed by the ABAP transaction service, typically involving database commits to finalize the changes. In standard ABAP programming, a database LUW ends when a program executes a COMMIT&amp;nbsp;WORK or ROLLBACK&amp;nbsp;WORK statement, or when a dialog transaction concludes. However, transactional consistency can only be ensured within the same database system. There are plenty of alternatives, when it comes to cloud-native architecture and micro service design. However, a well-established approach is to apply the paradigm of eventual consistency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371708102"&gt;Eventual Consistency&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Eventual consistency is a &lt;STRONG&gt;relaxed consistency model&lt;/STRONG&gt; in distributed systems where updates are not instantly propagated, meaning different replicas might temporarily show conflicting data. However, given enough time and the assumption that no further updates occur, the system guarantees that all data will reach a consistent state (soon).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175194597"&gt;The Transactional Outbox Pattern&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The transactional outbox pattern directly supports eventual consistency by &lt;STRONG&gt;decoupling&lt;/STRONG&gt; the &lt;STRONG&gt;primary data write&lt;/STRONG&gt; from the &lt;STRONG&gt;external message emission&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It ensures the message has been reliably persisted within the same database transaction as the data change, guaranteeing that the required event will &lt;EM&gt;only&lt;/EM&gt; be sent and consumed by other services, if the main transaction succeeded. Due to the defer of the message emission the micro service is much more robust against spontaneous outages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: Unstable microservice design.

This custom handler grants &lt;STRONG&gt;additional flexibility&lt;/STRONG&gt; on top of the transactional outbox pattern, allowing the ABAP application to control how a certain message should be handled (emitted to an external system, processed internally, etc.).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3: Implementation of the &amp;quot;Transactional Outbox Pattern&amp;quot; in ABAP Cloud." style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339618iE4B4FAB6592C11DD/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="bgpf-3.png" alt="Figure 3: Implementation of the &amp;quot;Transactional Outbox Pattern&amp;quot; in ABAP Cloud." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 3: Implementation of the "Transactional Outbox Pattern" in ABAP Cloud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This setup involves only two components, everything else is handled by the RAP runtime out-of-the-box:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The definition of a bgPF handler, which implements the actual message (e.g. external system call) emission. The handler needs to implement the interface IF_BGMC_OP_SINGLE.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;class zcl_rap_bgpf_request_shipping definition

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In modern SAP landscapes, integration plays a key role. Businesses often need to create &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Orders&lt;/STRONG&gt; automatically from external systems like &lt;STRONG&gt;e-commerce platforms, mobile apps, or middleware (CPI/PO)&lt;/STRONG&gt; — without manual effort in transactions like &lt;STRONG&gt;VA01&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditionally, developers used &lt;STRONG&gt;BAPIs (e.g., BAPI_SALESORDER_CREATEFROMDAT2)&lt;/STRONG&gt; or custom RFCs to achieve this. While functional, these approaches are &lt;STRONG&gt;not clean-core compliant&lt;/STRONG&gt;, hard to maintain, and don’t align with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP’s future-ready development model&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we’ll see how to achieve the same goal — &lt;STRONG&gt;create Sales Orders programmatically&lt;/STRONG&gt; — but in a &lt;STRONG&gt;modern and upgrade-safe way&lt;/STRONG&gt; using:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;RAP BO (Business Object)&lt;/STRONG&gt; for clean-core, model-driven design&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;EML (Entity Manipulation Language)&lt;/STRONG&gt; for easy create/update operations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;REST Framework&lt;/STRONG&gt; to expose our logic as a lightweight, consumable API&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why we are doing this:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To allow &lt;STRONG&gt;external systems&lt;/STRONG&gt; to create Sales Orders directly in SAP via an API&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To follow &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Clean Core&lt;/STRONG&gt; principles — no direct DB or BAPI calls&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To enable &lt;STRONG&gt;reusable, testable, and upgrade-safe&lt;/STRONG&gt; backend logic&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To demonstrate how &lt;STRONG&gt;RAP and EML&lt;/STRONG&gt; can replace traditional coding patterns&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Benefits:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fully &lt;STRONG&gt;OData/REST compliant&lt;/STRONG&gt; and can be consumed by any system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clean-core compatible&lt;/STRONG&gt; – future-proof against upgrades&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Uses &lt;STRONG&gt;standard RAP BO (I_SalesOrderTP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; – minimal custom logic&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lightweight &amp;amp; fast&lt;/STRONG&gt; – no heavy RFC/BAPI dependency&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Easy to extend – can include partners, pricing, schedule lines later&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP provides standard Sales Order APIs in the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Accelerator Hub&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but here we’ll focus on &lt;STRONG&gt;building our own&lt;/STRONG&gt; lightweight API using &lt;STRONG&gt;RAP BO and EML&lt;/STRONG&gt;, purely for learning and flexibility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before you begin, ensure:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You have access to an &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA system&lt;/STRONG&gt; (2020+ recommended)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;RAP model&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Service Binding&lt;/STRONG&gt; are configured&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The service endpoint is &lt;STRONG&gt;active and reachable&lt;/STRONG&gt; in /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You understand basic &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP classes and interfaces&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;What We’ll Build&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’ll create:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A &lt;STRONG&gt;REST API&lt;/STRONG&gt; to trigger Sales Order creation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Backend logic that uses &lt;STRONG&gt;RAP BO&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;EML&lt;/STRONG&gt; to insert data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A &lt;STRONG&gt;JSON payload/response&lt;/STRONG&gt; for easy integration with other systems&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;RAP BO Used&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I_SalesOrderTP&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Object Directory Entries Created&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Object Name&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Type&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Description&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;ZS4CL_DEMO_SO_HANDLE&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Class&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;HTTP Handler (API entry point)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;ZS4CL_DEMO_SO_RESOURCE&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Class&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resource class containing business logic&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;REST API&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Service&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Endpoint exposed for external consumption&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Step 1 – Create HTTP Handler Class: ZS4CL_DEMO_SO_HANDLE&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This class will handle all incoming API requests and route them to our main business logic class.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implementation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLASS zs4cl_demo_so_handle DEFINITION PUBLIC INHERITING FROM cl_rest_http_handler.

ENDCLASS.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What this does:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This class doesn’t perform any business logic itself — it simply routes incoming API calls to the &lt;STRONG&gt;resource class&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where we’ll handle them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Step 2 – Create Resource Class: ZS4CL_DEMO_SO_RESOURCE&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where all the fun happens!&lt;BR /&gt;We’ll redefine two methods:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;IF_REST_RESOURCE~GET → Get call for CSRF token ( no code required )&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;IF_REST_RESOURCE~POST → Our main logic for creating the Sales Order&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Define the Data Structures&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’ll define a local structure to hold the JSON request data:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_so_create_rap_bo,

         SalesOrderHeader             TYPE I_SalesOrderTP,

         SalesOrderItem               TYPE I_SalesOrderItemTP,

       END OF ty_so_create_rap_bo.



DATA: BEGIN OF ls_response,

        salesOrder TYPE I_SalesOrderTP-salesorder,

        message    TYPE string,

      END OF ls_response.

 Deserialize Incoming JSON Request

When the API is called, it will send data in JSON format.
We’ll read and convert that JSON into an ABAP structure:

DATA(lv_request_serialize) = mo_request-&amp;gt;get_entity( )-&amp;gt;get_string_data( ).



/ui2/cl_json=&amp;gt;deserialize(

  EXPORTING json = lv_request_serialize

  CHANGING  data = ls_sales_order_payload_rap_bo

).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Create Sales Order Using EML&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here we use &lt;STRONG&gt;EML (Entity Manipulation Language)&lt;/STRONG&gt; to insert a Sales Order and its item in one go.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;MODIFY ENTITIES OF i_salesordertp

  ENTITY salesorder

  CREATE FIELDS ( salesordertype salesorganization distributionchannel organizationdivision soldtoparty )

  WITH VALUE #( ( %cid = 'H001'

                  %data = VALUE #(

                    salesordertype        = ls_so_header-salesordertype

                    salesorganization     = ls_so_header-salesorganization

                    distributionchannel   = ls_so_header-distributionchannel

                    organizationdivision  = ls_so_header-organizationdivision

                    soldtoparty           = ls_so_header-soldtoparty

                  ) ) )



  CREATE BY item

  FIELDS ( product requestedquantity )

  WITH VALUE #( ( %cid_ref = 'H001'

                  %target = VALUE #( ( %cid = 'I001'

                                       product = ls_so_item-product

                                       requestedquantity = ls_so_item-requestedquantity ) ) ) )



  MAPPED DATA(ls_mapped)

  FAILED DATA(ls_failed)

  REPORTED DATA(ls_reported_modify).

 Commit and Return Response

Once the Sales Order is created successfully, we commit the entities and send a response back to the API caller.

COMMIT ENTITIES BEGIN

  RESPONSE OF i_salesordertp

  FAILED DATA(ls_save_failed)

  REPORTED DATA(ls_save_reported).



IF ls_save_failed-salesorder IS INITIAL.

  ls_response-message = 'Order Created'.

  ls_response-salesorder = ls_mapped-salesorderitem[ 1 ]-salesorder.

  io_entity-&amp;gt;set_header_field( iv_name = 'status' iv_value = '200' ).

ELSE.

  ls_response-message = 'Failed due to data issue'.

  io_entity-&amp;gt;set_header_field( iv_name = 'status' iv_value = '400' ).

ENDIF.



COMMIT ENTITIES END.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, send a JSON response:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DATA(json_response) = /ui2/cl_json=&amp;gt;serialize( data = ls_response ).

mo_response-&amp;gt;create_entity( )-&amp;gt;set_string_data( json_response ).

mo_response-&amp;gt;set_header_field(

  iv_name  = 'Content-Type',

  iv_value = 'application/json'

).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sample JSON Payload&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s what your external system (like Postman or CPI) will send:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{

  "SalesOrderHeader": {

    "SalesOrderType": "ZBV1",

    "SalesOrganization": "0700",

  },

  "SalesOrderItem": {

    "Product": "000000000000040078",

    "RequestedQuantity": "1"

  }

}

Sample Response

Success:

  "status": "200",

  "salesOrder": "0000123456",

  "message": "Order Created"

}

Failure:

{

  "status": "400",

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Collective Search Helps&lt;/STRONG&gt; in RAP have gained attention in recent community discussions. This comprehensive &lt;STRONG&gt;two-part series&lt;/STRONG&gt; explores collective search helps across both V2 and V4 service expositions, highlighting critical implementation differences and architectural considerations. &lt;STRONG&gt;Part 2&lt;/STRONG&gt; introduces an advanced hierarchical collective search help pattern for complex business scenarios—a solution not adequately documented yet in the SAP ecosystem.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Watch the demonstration video below to see collective search helps in action&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; - including template switching, multi-criteria search, and nested value help scenarios. The video showcases how users can seamlessly switch between different search templates (Technical Object Data, Maintenance Data, Asset Data, Address Data) and demonstrates the nested collective value help pattern where one value help (Equipment) utilizes another (Functional Location) within its selection fields.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A &lt;STRONG&gt;Collective Value Help&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a reusable model that groups&amp;nbsp;multiple&amp;nbsp;elementary value helps. If assigned as a value help provider, it allows the end user to search for values for a particular field in an application, across different search templates and select one or multiple values in the process. This pattern is particularly powerful for complex business objects requiring multi-criteria search capabilities. These are the RAP equivalent of traditional collective search helps in the SAPGUI world.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This article uses master data artifacts from Asset Management area—specifically Technical Objects, which comprise Equipment and Functional Locations. This scenario is ideal for collective search helps because users often need to search technical objects using different criteria: by object attributes, maintenance data, asset classification, or address information.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Below are the screenshots demonstrating the Collective Value Help UI from a simple working application that we’ll build in this article:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Technical Object search with multiple search template options" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342301iE18100A70E009319/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_0-1763468984182.png" alt="Technical Object search with multiple search template options" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Technical Object search with multiple search template options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Search by Technical Object Data template" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342300i852CFC4493993F42/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_1-1763468984194.png" alt="Search by Technical Object Data template" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Search by Technical Object Data template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Search by Functional Location template" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342302i6BB3914B67BB4385/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_2-1763468984206.png" alt="Search by Functional Location template" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Search by Functional Location template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Search by Equipment template" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342303i2185DE933E96EBFE/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_3-1763468984217.png" alt="Search by Equipment template" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Search by Equipment template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Notice how users can switch between different search templates (Technical Object Data, Maintenance Data, Asset Data, Address Data) to find the right technical object using various criteria. This multi-dimensional search capability is the core value proposition of collective search helps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline"

All the Collective Value Helps are essentially abstract entities, which consist of a bunch of Elementary Value Helps, each assigned a distinct qualifier. However, each of these CVHs has one template (elementary value help) which has no qualifier and becomes the default search template and thus, the provider of Fuzzy search capabilities, if provisioned in that CDS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Metadata Extension of an elementary value help used in the demo" style="width: 688px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342313i460B66D29690DB0C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_14-1763468984298.png" alt="Metadata Extension of an elementary value help used in the demo" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Metadata Extension of an elementary value help used in the demo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="The data definition of the elementary value help" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342316iF29FFED1EA65F999/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_15-1763468984313.png" alt="The data definition of the elementary value help" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;The data definition of the elementary value help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, this is purely a read only application which doesn’t require any business logic and thus is not created as a ROOT entity. We’ll simply create a Service Definition and Service Binding on top of the consumption View to enable projection at the SADL layer.:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Service Definition" style="width: 670px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342315i8CBB3223C06ED2E8/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_16-1763468984315.png" alt="Service Definition" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Service Definition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Critical Difference: V2 vs V4 Service Binding&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Service Definition can now be used to create both an OData V2 and an OData V4 Service binding. But there’s a crucial difference w.r.t. the entity sets and associations exposed in the bindings:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Service Binding (OData V4)" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342317i4C69CF42409032A1/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_17-1763468984322.png" alt="Service Binding (OData V4)" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Service Binding (OData V4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Service Binding (OData V2)" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342320i8DB925CDD89010C3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_18-1763468984332.png" alt="Service Binding (OData V2)" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Service Binding (OData V2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Service Binding (OData V2)" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342318iE8BE4C8657573D1E/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_19-1763468984341.png" alt="Service Binding (OData V2)" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Service Binding (OData V2)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the screenshots, it’s quite clear that for OData V2 - UI, all the internal Value Helps, including the collective Value helps are projected as end points along with the main entity ZAR_C_TechnicalObject. Whereas, in Odata V4 – UI, only the leading entity is projected. This is important for design considerations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;U&gt;Key Concepts &amp;amp; Considerations&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-disc"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The collective value help can only define the included elementary value helps and the necessary field name bindings. Thus, only the following annotations can be leveraged:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Consumption.valueHelpDefinition.entity.name&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Consumption.valueHelpDefinition.entity.element&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Consumption.valueHelpDefinition.additionalBinding.localElement&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Consumption.valueHelpDefinition.additionalBinding.element&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Consumption.valueHelpDefinition.qualifier&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Consumption.valueHelpDefinition.label&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If a collective value help is assigned to the field as value help provider&amp;nbsp;@Consumption.valueHelpDefinition... no further value helps should be assigned to this field. i.e., all required elementary value helps must be included in the collective value help.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The collective value help must be annotated with @ObjectModel.collectiveValueHelp.for.element pointing to the field, for which the collective value help is defined.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The field referenced by @ObjectModel.collectiveValueHelp.for.element must be assigned at least a single elementary value help by its annotation @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The consumer view of the collective value help must define the same fields, that are used in the collective value help definition&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Collective value helps can only be used in SADL based ODATA services, both V2 and V4&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A CDS abstract entity is to be used as a representative for the collective value help carrying the grouping information and&amp;nbsp;enable its assignment like an elementary value help&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Constraints&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Collective value helps should not define parameters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Collective value helps should not be used as "elementary value helps" of other collective value helps (i.e. the collective value helps may not be nested, more on this below)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1692417"&gt;@search&lt;/a&gt;..., i.e. search capabilities are not defined by the collective value&amp;nbsp;help, but by its referenced elementary value helps only (the default value help template takes precedence)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Workaround for Nested Collective Value Helps&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As per the restrictions outlined above, &lt;STRONG&gt;Collective Value Helps cannot be nested&lt;/STRONG&gt;, i.e., a collective value help cannot utilise another CVH as an elementary Value Help. Having said that, each elementary value help in a CVH can have its own selection fields, where one might feel the need to incorporate multiple search templates, such as the case below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Search by Functional Location template in Equipment CVH" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342319iD1111169AAA5126D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_20-1763468984348.png" alt="Search by Functional Location template in Equipment CVH" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Search by Functional Location template in Equipment CVH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here, an Equipment CVH has a search template &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Search by Functional Location&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which again has a selection field for Functional Location field, where in a user can feel the need to plug in multiple search templates. However, they may not be able to use the Functional Location CVH directly as direct nesting is not allowed. In that case, one can still create a collective value help, but without utilising an abstract entity:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Source Code of Value Help ZAR_C_EquipFunctionalLocDataVH" style="width: 805px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342321iB111DBF0F4D253BE/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_21-1763468984354.png" alt="Source Code of Value Help ZAR_C_EquipFunctionalLocDataVH" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Source Code of Value Help ZAR_C_EquipFunctionalLocDataVH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Source Code of Value Help ZAR_C_EquipFunctionalLocDataVH" style="width: 840px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342322iDA575A8B3AB35BBD/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_22-1763468984362.png" alt="Source Code of Value Help ZAR_C_EquipFunctionalLocDataVH" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Source Code of Value Help ZAR_C_EquipFunctionalLocDataVH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Collective search helps in RAP provide a powerful, user-centric approach to value help management by enabling multi-dimensional search capabilities through a single, reusable model. This article has demonstrated how to implement collective search helps across both OData V2 and V4 service expositions, highlighting the critical architectural differences between these versions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key takeaways from this implementation guide:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Service Binding Differences Matter:&lt;/STRONG&gt; V2 exposes all value help entities as separate endpoints, while V4 embeds them within the main entity—an important consideration for service design and integration scenarios.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Abstract Entities as CVH Carriers:&lt;/STRONG&gt; CDS abstract entities serve as the structural foundation for grouping elementary value helps, enabling clean separation of concerns and reusability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Nested Workarounds:&lt;/STRONG&gt; While direct nesting of collective value helps is restricted, inline value help definitions provide a practical alternative for complex scenarios.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SADL Layer Compatibility:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Collective search helps work seamlessly across both V2 and V4 SADL-based OData services, making them a versatile pattern for modern RAP applications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Coming in Part 2: Hierarchical Collective Search Helps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Part 2&lt;/STRONG&gt; will introduce &lt;STRONG&gt;hierarchical collective search helps&lt;/STRONG&gt;—an advanced pattern enabling parent-child relationship visualization within value help dialogs. This advanced implementation addresses complex business scenarios requiring hierarchical data navigation, showcasing the full potential of RAP's value help framework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-container"&gt;&lt;a class="lia-spoiler-link" href="#" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;noscript&gt; (Highlight to read)&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-border"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-content"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#339966"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sneak peek....&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-container"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-content"&gt;Sneak peek....&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Hierarchical value help" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342323iD3008580179648A1/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Abhinav_Roy_23-1763468984373.png" alt="Hierarchical value help" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Hierarchical value help&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

It’s “invisible” because you rarely write code for many of its steps — but knowing &lt;EM&gt;what it does&lt;/EM&gt; is key to debug &amp;amp; optimise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The RAP runtime is responsible for orchestrating everything that happens when you call an action, modify data, run validation/determinations, or commit a business object.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key responsibilities of RAP runtime:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Provides draft handling&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Maintains transactional buffers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Runs determinations/validations/actions in the right order&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensures ACID properties for business transactions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Consolidates errors, warnings, and messages through REPORTED structure&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Writes data to the database &lt;STRONG&gt;only after commit&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The most important thing to understand: &lt;STRONG&gt;RAP never directly updates the DB during EML calls.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Everything goes into the RAP transactional buffer first.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s how the runtime engine typically handles a transactional request (e.g., modify, create, action on a BO):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Receive Request&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The service binding/OData call enters the RAP runtime. The runtime frameworks dispatch this to the correct BO implementation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Interaction Phase: Loading &amp;amp; Buffering&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If the request references existing data, the runtime loads the existing BO instance into the &lt;STRONG&gt;transactional buffer&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If it’s new data, buffer is prepared accordingly with new instance(s).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All modifications (via EML) are made against the buffer, &lt;STRONG&gt;not&lt;/STRONG&gt; directly the database.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This phase may include edit/draft handling, business logic, change of states.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Save Sequence Trigger&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Once the interaction phase completes (i.e., no more immediate edit tasks), the runtime triggers the Save Sequence.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consistency Checks &amp;amp; Late Logic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The runtime runs final determinations, validations to ensure data integrity.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Any failures here cause rollback of buffer (no DB write).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Then key generating logic (late numbering etc) happens if required.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Database Write &amp;amp; Buffer Clean-up&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The buffered changes are persisted and the transactional buffer is cleaned up.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The runtime returns results (&lt;STRONG&gt;FAILED&lt;/STRONG&gt; / &lt;STRONG&gt;REPORTED&lt;/STRONG&gt; / &lt;STRONG&gt;MAPPED&lt;/STRONG&gt;) to the caller.&lt;BR /&gt;The runtime can also be further divided into &lt;STRONG&gt;Standard Operations&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Non-standard Operations&lt;/STRONG&gt; Runtime based on the operation types.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Source : help.sap.com" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344002i982D552186D281EA/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Runtime.png" alt="Source : help.sap.com" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Source : help.sap.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5" color="#333399"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":left_arrow:"&gt;⬅️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5" color="#333399"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP RAP Transactional Buffers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The&amp;nbsp;ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model&amp;nbsp;(RAP) does not introduce its own LUW concept, but uses the rules and concepts of the SAP LUW and thus does&amp;nbsp;inherent checks ensure that your application is consistent and stable, also when more than one BO is involved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;RAP uses an internal transactional buffer (in-memory layer) to temporarily hold all data modifications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is the key “scratch‐pad” where all modifications happen before anything goes to the database. Think of it like a workspace for your BO operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every operation (create, update, delete, action) targets an instance in the buffer first. The buffer is internal to RAP runtime — you don’t explicitly manage it, you just use EML and commit/rollback.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT size="3"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It ensures &lt;STRONG&gt;isolation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: multiple requests don’t interfere until commit.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It provides a stage for &lt;STRONG&gt;determinations/validations&lt;/STRONG&gt; before final write.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It allows &lt;STRONG&gt;draft mode&lt;/STRONG&gt;: you can work on data in draft buffer without touching active DB immediately.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It ensures you can &lt;STRONG&gt;rollback&lt;/STRONG&gt; if something fails without partial DB updates — ACID in practise.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s how you visualise it:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 1.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344008iD36892988D173E64/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Picture 1.png" alt="Picture 1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Buffer Behaviour in Different Modes:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are &lt;STRONG&gt;two types&lt;/STRONG&gt; of buffers &lt;STRONG&gt;Draft Buffer/Draft Runtime &amp;amp; Active Transactional Buffer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Let’s break them down.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Active Transactional Buffer – The In-Memory DB-Staging Area&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Active Transactional Buffer&lt;/STRONG&gt; is used when you work on &lt;STRONG&gt;active instances&lt;/STRONG&gt; (not in draft mode).&lt;BR /&gt;This handles &lt;STRONG&gt;all temporary changes for active data until COMMIT ENTITIES&lt;/STRONG&gt;.No draft tables involved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;When It Is Used&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When your BO is &lt;STRONG&gt;not draft-enabled&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When your BO &lt;EM&gt;is&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;draft-enabled&lt;/STRONG&gt; but you are working on &lt;STRONG&gt;active instances&lt;/STRONG&gt; (e.g., %is_draft = 00).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When triggering actions that operate on &lt;STRONG&gt;active&lt;/STRONG&gt; data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Happens on COMMIT&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At COMMIT, RAP takes all pending changes from the transactional buffer, runs validations and determinations, executes the save sequence, and finally writes everything to the database.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Draft Buffer aka Draft Runtime– Your Temporary Workspace&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Draft Buffer is a staging area inside the RAP runtime that stores unsaved, in-progress work of a user managed by Draft Runtime.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;RESTful applications require a constant stateless communication with the backend to prevent that transient data is lost when a user session ends, drafts are essential.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here, for &lt;STRONG&gt;new-draft&lt;/STRONG&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;STRONG&gt;edit-draft&lt;/STRONG&gt; instances, data gets updates in Draft Database tables only upon &lt;STRONG&gt;COMMIT ENTITIES&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Only on ACTIVATE, it gets converted into &lt;STRONG&gt;Active Instance in a Active Transactional Buffer&lt;/STRONG&gt; and then gets persisted to database table on &lt;STRONG&gt;COMMIT ENTITIES&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;When It Is Used&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;When you run MODIFY ENTITIES ...

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1636546246"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this workshop, we will build a simple &lt;STRONG&gt;Item business object&lt;/STRONG&gt; using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) on an SAP BTP trial system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;RAP is SAP’s &lt;STRONG&gt;strategic programming model&lt;/STRONG&gt; for developing cloud-ready, Fiori-enabled business applications in ABAP. It provides a &lt;STRONG&gt;clean, end-to-end programming model&lt;/STRONG&gt; where you can define business objects, behaviors, services, and UI-ready projections in a structured way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we will:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Create a &lt;STRONG&gt;database table&lt;/STRONG&gt; for items.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Define &lt;STRONG&gt;CDS root and projection views&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Implement &lt;STRONG&gt;behavior definitions&lt;/STRONG&gt; with CRUD, and enhance it with actions, validations and determinations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Create a&lt;STRONG&gt; virtual element&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Expose the business object as an &lt;STRONG&gt;OData service&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Preview it in &lt;STRONG&gt;Fiori&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;By the end, you will understand how RAP objects are structured, connected, and how Clean Core principles are applied in a real example.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569115460"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why RAP?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud-ready:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP’s standard for S/4HANA cloud extensions and custom apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clean Core compliant:&lt;/STRONG&gt; No modifications to standard objects; all extensibility is via APIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;End-to-end model:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Business logic, UI, draft handling, and authorizations all in one place.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consistency:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Automatic CRUD, locking, and draft handling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fiori-ready:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Generates OData services consumable by Fiori Elements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Productivity:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Faster development than classical ABAP or BOPF.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1243519236"&gt;Environment Setup&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;For this demo, we use &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Development Tools (ADT) in Eclipse&lt;/STRONG&gt; connected to an &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP on Cloud project&lt;/STRONG&gt; on an SAP BTP trial system.

Packages are like folders in Eclipse—they help manage all the development objects together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. In Eclipse, right-click your &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP on Cloud project&lt;/STRONG&gt; → &lt;STRONG&gt;New&lt;/STRONG&gt; → &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Package&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="1.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344473iDBF146E378CCC4E9/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="1.png" alt="1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Enter package details&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="2.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344475iB215BAC9F968C11A/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="2.png" alt="2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;All RAP objects (tables, CDS views, behavior definitions, service definitions) should be in the same package.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;It ensures &lt;STRONG&gt;clean core compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;, meaning your custom objects don’t modify standard SAP objects directly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-390034430"&gt;Step 2: Create Database Table&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The database table is the foundation of your RAP business object. For this example, we’ll create a table called ZITEM02 for our Item BO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Right-click your package → &lt;STRONG&gt;New&lt;/STRONG&gt; → &lt;STRONG&gt;Other Repository Object&amp;nbsp;→&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;search for &lt;STRONG&gt;"Database Table".&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="3.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344477iEA014D963338068F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="3.png" alt="3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="4.png" style="width: 356px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344479i4DADF5F9D023EA19/image-dimensions/356x301/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="356" height="301" role="button" title="4.png" alt="4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Add the fields and mark &lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;item_id&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;as the &lt;STRONG&gt;primary key&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@EndUserText.label : 'Item Table'
@AbapCatalog.enhancement.category : #NOT_EXTENSIBLE
@AbapCatalog.tableCategory : #TRANSPARENT

@AbapCatalog.dataMaintenance : #RESTRICTED
define table zitem_02 {

  key client            : abap.clnt not null;
  key item_id           : sysuuid_x16 not null;
  name                  : abap.char(50) not null;
  description           : abap.char(100);
  price                 : abap.dec(10,2);

  local_last_changed_at : abp_locinst_lastchange_tstmpl;
  last_changed_at       : abp_lastchange_tstmpl;

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Activate the table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="5.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344481i41330E6D10684F13/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5.png" alt="5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The table &lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;ZITEM_02&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;serves as the &lt;STRONG&gt;persistent layer&lt;/STRONG&gt; for your RAP business object. All data is stored here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Administrative Fields:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;local_created_by&lt;/FONT&gt;/ &lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;local_created_at&lt;/FONT&gt; → track &lt;STRONG&gt;who created&lt;/STRONG&gt; the record and &lt;STRONG&gt;when&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;local_last_changed_by&lt;/FONT&gt; / &lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;local_last_changed_at&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;→ track &lt;STRONG&gt;local changes&lt;/STRONG&gt; before activation (important for draft-enabled objects).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;last_changed_at&lt;/FONT&gt; → tracks the &lt;STRONG&gt;last committed change&lt;/STRONG&gt;; used as the &lt;STRONG&gt;ETag&lt;/STRONG&gt; for locking and consistency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Admin Fields Matter:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;RAP automatically uses them for &lt;STRONG&gt;draft management, locking, and optimistic concurrency control&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Even if your app is simple, including them makes your BO &lt;STRONG&gt;ready for enhancements&lt;/STRONG&gt; such as validations, actions, and side effects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-64438206"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--2992580"&gt;Step 3: Create CDS&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--145654735"&gt;1. Root View&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The root view sits on top of the database table and defines the &lt;STRONG&gt;entity structure&lt;/STRONG&gt; for your business object. It is the source for the &lt;STRONG&gt;behavior definition&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Right-click the database table → &lt;STRONG&gt;New Data Definition&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344483i505710536A39533D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="6.png" alt="6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Select the &lt;STRONG&gt;Root View Entity&lt;/STRONG&gt; template.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="7.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344484i3E216219E29E360D/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="7.png" alt="7.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED

      last_changed_at       as LastChangedAt
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Table = raw persistence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Root view = &lt;STRONG&gt;business-level representation&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enriched with semantics, annotations, and ready for behavior logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The root view defines the &lt;STRONG&gt;primary key&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;item_id&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;to match the table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--342168240"&gt;2. Projection View&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The projection view is built on top of the root view and serves as the entry point for service exposure. Here, we select which fields are exposed in the transactional OData service. We can also include UI annotations to guide Fiori Elements in rendering the app automatically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Right-click the Root View CDS → &lt;STRONG&gt;New Data Definition&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Select the &lt;STRONG&gt;Projection View&lt;/STRONG&gt; template.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="8.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344487i2026ED2C88E5F7EA/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="8.png" alt="8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The root view contains the core business data and logic, while the projection only exposes what the frontend needs. This way, we don’t modify or clutter the core data model with UI-specific details, keeping the core stable and extensible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;For today, I’ll keep the UI annotations minimal here and show how to add them cleanly in a &lt;STRONG&gt;metadata extension&lt;/STRONG&gt; later, which keeps our projection view tidy and focused on data exposure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-48124269"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--441792243"&gt;Step 4: Create Behavior Definition&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The behavior definition specifies how this entity behaves at runtime: which operations are allowed, It maps fields from the root view to the database table, and how draft actions are handled.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Right-click the Root View CDS → &lt;STRONG&gt;New Behavior Definition&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="9.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344493i20C5AB9D6E1378DC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="9.png" alt="9.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since the purpose of this first example is to display the list report, we only need to map fields from the root view to the database table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;managed implementation in class zbp_r_item_02 unique;

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;readonly&lt;/STRONG&gt; → The field cannot be changed by the user. RAP ensures it is protected in the frontend and backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;numbering : managed&lt;/STRONG&gt; → RAP automatically generates unique values for this field when a new entity is created. You don’t need to write your own logic for primary keys like UUIDs or sequences.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;behavior projection&lt;/STRONG&gt; allows us to expose only a subset of behavior from the main entity for a specific service. This is useful if we want different services to expose different parts of the behavior without modifying the core behavior definition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;projection;

Here, we expose our projection view, making our User BO available for Fiori or API consumption. Service definitions are protocol-agnostic and can later be consumed via different bindings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@EndUserText.label: 'Service Definition for Item'

After activation, Publish the service and it can be accessed directly from Fiori elements or any OData client.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="11.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344507iF5E66C18ED2814DE/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="11.png" alt="11.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At this stage, our Business Object is not draft-enabled and does not support create/update/delete yet.&lt;BR /&gt;This means the Fiori Elements application shows a &lt;STRONG&gt;read-only list report&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and because the table is empty, the preview will be blank.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="12.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344541i8965C571AC46A4D0/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="12.png" alt="12.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This step is intentional — it confirms that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;the CDS views are correct&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;the projection is exposed&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;the service binding is active&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;the app renders successfully with no errors&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even with no data, seeing the list report appear is an important milestone. In the next sections, we will add draft support and enable full CRUD operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--737929751"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--934443256"&gt;Part 2: Enabling Draft, CRUD Operations, and Transactional Behavior in the RAP Business Object&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In&lt;STRONG&gt; Part 1&lt;/STRONG&gt; of this series, we created the foundation of our RAP application:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;A clean core–compliant database table&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;The CDS root view entity&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;The projection view&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;A minimal behavior definition&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;A service binding that exposes our object to Fiori&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;At that stage, the generated application was intentionally &lt;STRONG&gt;read-only&lt;/STRONG&gt;, serving as a good starting point to verify that the service and CDS structure work correctly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, in &lt;STRONG&gt;Part 2&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we take the next major step: turning our read-only object into a &lt;STRONG&gt;full transactional Business Object&lt;/STRONG&gt; using the managed RAP BO approach. This includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Activating &lt;STRONG&gt;Create&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Update&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;Delete&lt;/STRONG&gt; support&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enabling &lt;STRONG&gt;Draft handling&lt;/STRONG&gt; for safe data entry&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Allowing the Fiori Elements app to automatically render UI flows such as Edit, Save, Delete, and Discard Draft&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Preparing the BO for further business logic enhancements (which we will add in Part 3)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1424359768"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why We Enable Draft in RAP?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Draft is one of the key features of Fiori Elements applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before enabling it, it’s important to explain &lt;EM&gt;why&lt;/EM&gt; draft is needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1914276280"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Users expect modern UI behavior&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In modern SAP Fiori apps, users do not commit their changes immediately. Instead:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;They can start editing an object.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Leave the page.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Navigate back later.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recover their unsaved changes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This improves the UX significantly and eliminates accidental data loss.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1942606094"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Draft prevents incomplete database commits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Draft ensures that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Partial or inconsistent data is never saved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Users can enter complex data in multiple steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Locks on active instances are minimized.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is especially important in enterprise systems with many concurrent users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--2139119599"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;RAP provides draft automatically&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks to RAP’s managed BO runtime, draft functionality requires &lt;STRONG&gt;no custom code&lt;/STRONG&gt; — only a few declarations in the behavior definition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--2042230097"&gt;Step 1: Updating the Behavior Definition of the Root Entity&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Add&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;with&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;draft;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Add &lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;draft table zitem_02_d;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This associates the BO with a draft table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If the draft table does not exist yet, ADT will offer to create it automatically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Click on "Quick assist" ( CTRL + 1 )&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="13.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344561i81FF83A799464957/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="13.png" alt="13.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@EndUserText.label : 'Draft table for entity ZR_ITEM_02'

Additional Draft Actions and What They Do&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In RAP, the draft handling pattern can be extended beyond the basic actions .&lt;BR /&gt;For more advanced scenarios — especially when working with optimized draft flows, background checks, or multi-step editing — we can include the following actions:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;  draft action Activate optimized;
  draft action Edit;
  draft action Discard;
  draft action Resume;
  draft determine action Prepare { }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond the basic Edit / Activate / Discard pattern, RAP provides additional draft actions to improve performance and user experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Resume&lt;/STRONG&gt; – restores an existing draft so users can continue where they left off.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prepare&lt;/STRONG&gt; – pre-fills data before the user sees the draft instance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These actions require no manual coding unless you want to enhance them, and together they deliver a modern, safe, Fiori-compliant editing workflow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. Add&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;total&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;etag&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;LastChangedAt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This ETag is used by RAP to guarantee concurrency and data consistency.&lt;BR /&gt;It prevents situations where one user accidentally overwrites changes made by another user.&lt;BR /&gt;It is also required for draft handling and for the Fiori Elements UI, which relies on this timestamp to detect outdated edits.&lt;BR /&gt;RAP automatically manages this field, updating it whenever the record is changed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Update the Behavior Projection&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The projection behavior definition exposes the business behavior to the Fiori UI and the OData service. Even if the root BO supports create, update, delete, and draft actions, they must be explicitly enabled in the behavior projection. Without this step, Fiori Elements will not show the Create/Edit/Delete or draft buttons. The projection layer ensures clean core separation by keeping internal logic in the root BO while exposing only the required operations to the UI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;projection;
strict ( 2 );
use draft;

define behavior for ZC_ITEM_02 alias Item

  use create;

  use action Activate;
  use action Edit;
  use action Discard;
  use action Resume;
  use action Prepare;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. Create Behavior Implementation Class&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Eclipse generates a global ABAP class with the naming convention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="14.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344563i0F61B1FF8B9FE73D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="14.png" alt="14.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Understanding What “Managed Implementation” Means&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standard CRUD is generated automatically&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You &lt;STRONG&gt;do not&lt;/STRONG&gt; need to write: create/ update/ delete logic, draft save/ load logic, locking logic, ETag management&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;RAP provides all of this out of the box.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The class is only for custom behavior&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where we will later implement &lt;STRONG&gt;v&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;alidations&lt;/STRONG&gt; (check input before save), &lt;STRONG&gt;d&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;eterminations&lt;/STRONG&gt; (auto-fill fields),&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;a&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ctions&lt;/STRONG&gt; (mark item as completed), &lt;STRONG&gt;u&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;nmanaged logic,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;feature control, a&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;uthorization checks&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, if needed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But for Part 2 (Draft + CRUD), the class stays empty.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;Creating the Metadata Extension (UI Annotations)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After creating the &lt;STRONG&gt;projection view&lt;/STRONG&gt; and exposing the BO behavior, we need to define how this data should be displayed in Fiori Elements apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where &lt;STRONG&gt;metadata extensions&lt;/STRONG&gt; come into play. They allow you to add UI annotations &lt;STRONG&gt;without touching the core CDS view&lt;/STRONG&gt;, keeping your implementation clean and following &lt;STRONG&gt;Clean Core principles&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Right-click on the Consumption View → &lt;STRONG&gt;New&lt;/STRONG&gt; → &lt;STRONG&gt;Metadata Extension&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Metadata.layer: #CORE
annotate entity ZC_ITEM_02 with
{
  @UI.facet: [
         {
             purpose: #STANDARD,
             type: #IDENTIFICATION_REFERENCE,
             label: 'Items',
             position: 10
         } ]
  ItemId;
  @UI.lineItem: [{ position: 10, label: 'Name' }]
  @UI.identification: [{ position: 10, label: 'Name' }]
  Name;
  @UI.lineItem: [{ position: 20, label: 'Description' }]
  @UI.identification: [{ position: 20, label: 'Description' }]
  Description;
  @UI.lineItem: [{ position: 30, label: 'Price' }]
  @UI.identification: [{ position: 30, label: 'Price' }]
  Price;
  @UI.lineItem: [{ position: 40, label: 'Status Code' }]
  @UI.identification: [{ position: 40, label: 'Status Code' }]
  StatusCode;

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;The metadata extension defines how the Item BO is displayed in Fiori Elements. Using annotations like &lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1445379"&gt;@ui&lt;/a&gt;.lineItem&lt;/FONT&gt; and &lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1445379"&gt;@ui&lt;/a&gt;.Identification&lt;/FONT&gt;, we specify which fields appear in the list report and object header. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1445379"&gt;@ui&lt;/a&gt;.facet&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;groups the fields into a standard identification card. Placing these annotations in a metadata extension layer ensures &lt;STRONG&gt;Clean Core compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;, separating UI concerns from business logic, while enabling a ready-to-use Fiori preview.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After adding &lt;STRONG&gt;draft-enabled behavior&lt;/STRONG&gt; and the &lt;STRONG&gt;metadata extension&lt;/STRONG&gt;, let’s see the results in the Fiori preview:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="17.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344567i3353399C54E11C23/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="17.png" alt="17.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create Button &lt;/STRONG&gt;appears automatically at the top of the list report and clicking it opens a &lt;STRONG&gt;draft object&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ready for entry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="19.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344569i0C0FBDCF3D894E55/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="19.png" alt="19.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Delete Button&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;appears at the top of the list report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;List Report&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;d&lt;SPAN&gt;isplays all annotated fields &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;without manually selecting columns&lt;/STRONG&gt;, s&lt;SPAN&gt;hows all items.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="18.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/344568i72F6807AC55D6A1F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="18.png" alt="18.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Object Page: &lt;/STRONG&gt;clicking a list entry opens the object page.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Edit Button&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;is visible on the object page, c&lt;SPAN&gt;licking it opens the draft for editing, supporting &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;safe modifications&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; before activation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This confirms that &lt;STRONG&gt;draft-enabled RAP objects&lt;/STRONG&gt;, combined with &lt;STRONG&gt;metadata annotations&lt;/STRONG&gt;, automatically generate a full-featured Fiori UI: list report, object page, and CRUD actions—&lt;STRONG&gt;all without writing UI code manually&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1945340595"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--2141854100"&gt;Part 3:&amp;nbsp;Enhancing the Item BO with Actions, Determinations, Validations, and Virtual Elements&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;to be continued&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi! We want to use SAP Build Apps to create a full-stack application using ABAP (ADT-Eclipse) as backend, but we can't create a communication arrangement. We've tried multiple approaches, such as:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;-Using the shared account provided through the e-learning materials&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;-Using a free trial personal BTP account&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;-Connecting to a private cloud/on-premise system via the Cloud Connector.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, each approach resulted in connection issues that we could not resolve. Given the current circumstances, we presume that regardless of the approach, we need to have access to an ABAP-on-Cloud instance in which admin roles are granted to me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is what our ABAP instance dashboard shows:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ionutbirescu_0-1764682152554.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347583i5E3DE8B20D4E59F6/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="ionutbirescu_0-1764682152554.png" alt="ionutbirescu_0-1764682152554.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We've followed several tutorials, and we think we should have an Administrator tile and also, when we search Communication in the app finder, we only get&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;System Outbound Communication as result.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We'd greatly appreciate any tips or guidance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;In this blog, I’m going to walk you through how to implement unmanaged CRUD operations in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP RAP&lt;/STRONG&gt; for an on-premise system. We’ll be using a simple &lt;STRONG&gt;employee management&lt;/STRONG&gt; example to cover the basics of creating, updating, and deleting employee records.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By the end of this post, you’ll understand how to work with CRUD operations in the &lt;STRONG&gt;RAP framework&lt;/STRONG&gt; and get hands-on experience with it. I’ve been working on this project recently, and I figured it would be useful to share the process with you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Just a quick note: I’ve been using &lt;STRONG&gt;AI&lt;/STRONG&gt; (like GenAI) to help with writing content for this blog. It’s been super helpful for organizing thoughts and getting content down quickly while I focus on the technical stuff. AI’s a great tool for speeding up writing, and I think it’s worth mentioning how it’s making content creation a bit easier for me.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Visual Structure Example:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;+---------------------------------------+

define table zun_emp_tab {
  key client    : abap.clnt not null;
  key emp_id    : zempid not null;
  first_name    : abap.char(30);
  last_name     : abap.char(30);
  date_of_birth : abap.dats;

  salary        : abap.curr(15,2);
  curry         : abap.cuky;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1828062091"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2: Create a Root View for the Table&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Root View&lt;/STRONG&gt; is like a connection between the database table and the system. It allows the data to be used for CRUD operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'Interface view'
@Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations: true
define root view entity zun_emp_root as select from zun_emp_tab
{
   key emp_id as EmpId,

   last_name as LastName,
   date_of_birth as DateOfBirth,
   email as Email,
   hire_date as HireDate,

   salary as Salary,
   curry as Curry
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1631548586"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3: Create a Projection View for the Root View&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;A &lt;STRONG&gt;Projection View&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a simplified version of the Root View, designed specifically for consumption in applications. It lets users view and edit employee information in a user-friendly format.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #NOT_REQUIRED
@EndUserText.label: 'Consumption View'
@Metadata.ignorePropagatedAnnotations: true
@Metadata.allowExtensions: true
define root view entity zun_emp_proj as projection on zun_emp_root
{
    key EmpId,
    FirstName,
    LastName,
    DateOfBirth,
    Email,
    HireDate,
    @Semantics.amount.currencyCode: 'Curry'
    Salary,
    Curry
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1435035081"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4: Create Behavior Definition for the Root View&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where we define what can happen to the data (create, update, delete). We set permissions and behaviors for each operation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;unmanaged implementation in class zbp_un_emp_root unique;
strict ( 2 );
define behavior for zun_emp_root alias  EMP
late numbering
lock master
authorization master ( instance )
//etag master &amp;lt;field_name&amp;gt;
{
  create;
  update;
  delete;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1238521576"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5: Create Behavior Definition for the Projection View&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similar to the Root View, we define behavior for the Projection View, ensuring that data can be created, updated, and deleted in the UI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;projection;
strict ( 2 );

define behavior for zun_emp_proj alias EMP
{
  use create;
  use update;
  use delete;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1042008071"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 6: Create a Metadata Extension for the Projection View&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here, we enhance the UI by adding labels, fields, and other settings so users can easily interact with the employee data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@Metadata.layer: #CUSTOMER

@UI.headerInfo: {
  typeName: 'Employee',
  typeNamePlural: 'Employees',

    value: 'EmpId'

};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-845494566"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 7: Implement the Logic for CRUD Operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;We write the logic that handles creating, updating, and deleting employee records. We use three key components:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Handler Class&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This is where the main logic for CRUD operations happens.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Saver Class&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This class saves the changes to the database.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Buffer Class&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This is like a temporary holding place for changes before they are saved to the database.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Simplified Diagram:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;+------------------+   --&amp;gt; (Create, Update, Delete)

We created a database table, set up views, and defined behavior for creating, updating, and deleting employee records.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--341387047"&gt;Why We Use Flags&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The flags (&lt;CODE&gt;C&lt;/CODE&gt; for Create, &lt;CODE&gt;U&lt;/CODE&gt; for Update, &lt;CODE&gt;D&lt;/CODE&gt; for Delete) help us track which operation needs to be performed on the data. These flags allow the system to know whether to insert, update, or delete a record in the database.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--537900552"&gt;Using AI for Faster Content Creation&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;While practicing and writing the code, I used &lt;STRONG&gt;AI&lt;/STRONG&gt; for faster content generation. AI helps speed up tasks like documentation and explanations, but the real learning comes from coding and understanding the process firsthand.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Authors: &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srjones/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Steven Jones&lt;/A&gt; (AWS), &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonjalienard/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sonja Liénard&lt;/A&gt; (SAP)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The key to SAP’s innovation and adoption success has always been its openness, supporting diverse hardware platforms, networks, and technology ecosystems, while offering flexible deployment options for customers operating in mixed and heterogeneous environments. This principle extends to the ABAP Platform and especially the BTP ABAP Environment, which powers next-generation ABAP Cloud applications and extensions. Beyond this openness, SAP is leveraging innovative technologies like AWS's ARM-based Graviton processors. Today, we are excited to announce the evolution of that partnership:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP and AWS will collaborate to bring the SAP BTP ABAP environment to Arm-based AWS Graviton processors.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766492999"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Longstanding History of Co-Innovation in the Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Since 2008, SAP partnered with AWS to help customers leverage cloud innovations. In 2023, we announced that &lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2023/11/sap-hana-cloud-now-supports-aws-graviton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP HANA Cloud runs on AWS Graviton&lt;/A&gt;, a custom-built chip by AWS that delivers price, performance, and energy efficiency benefits for cloud workloads. By initially migrating SAP HANA Cloud to AWS Graviton3-based Amazon EC2 instances, SAP has seen up to 30% better compute performance for analytical workloads and lowered its compute carbon footprint by an estimated 45%. Building on these experiences, SAP and AWS have been continuously innovating to further improve the performance of SAP HANA Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569979494"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Driving Flexibility and Performance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;SAP BTP ABAP environment is the platform as a service offering for ABAP developers. It’s a cloud-optimized ABAP platform based on SAP HANA Cloud that serves as a development and runtime environment for cloud applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Initial tests have shown positive results for ABAP on AWS Graviton architectures, demonstrating strong performance and efficiency gains. With the extensive breadth of Amazon EC2 instance families available on Arm, SAP will be able to select the right instance type and size optimized for ABAP workloads and leverage this diverse portfolio for maximum instance flexibility for our customers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373465989"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Arm and AWS Graviton?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;With AWS Graviton3-based instances, SAP experienced up to 35% price-performance improvement for analytics workloads, and a reduction of the compute carbon footprint of SAP HANA Cloud workloads. With AWS Graviton4-based instances, we’ve seen an up to 25% additional performance improvement for analytical and up to 40% additional improvement for transactional workloads compared to AWS Graviton3-based instances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Now, with the next AWS Graviton5-based Amazon EC2 M9g instances, we’ve observed a 35-60% increase in the performance of our OLTP queries on SAP HANA Cloud in a single generation. Based on the performance improvements demonstrated in SAP HANA Cloud with AWS Graviton processors, SAP is confident the SAP BTP ABAP environment will also leverage AWS Graviton technology to deliver similar benefits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1176952484"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Strategic Partnership for Sustainability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This new collaboration continues our shared commitment to sustainability. SAP is a signatory of Amazon’s Climate Pledge and has accelerated its own sustainability commitment to 2030. Our journey with AWS Graviton aligns perfectly with those goals, and we are eager to see what additional improvements in energy efficiency we can realize together in the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-980438979"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Porting the SAP BTP ABAP environment to AWS Graviton involves adapting its cloud-native architecture, including containerized services and runtime components, to Arm. SAP and AWS teams will continue developing, testing, and working on performance optimization pipelines to ensure a seamless experience for customers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We look forward to sharing more updates on this project and the value it brings in terms of performance, reliability, and sustainability. Stay tuned as we continue this journey together.&lt;/P&gt;</content>
