Part of the fascination is the possibility that humans push boundaries of what is physically possible. But physical laws are still in place, and accidents end fatally when something goes wrong, due to heights of dozens or thousands of meters or speeds needed for starts and landings. How much risk is the dream worth taking?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On December 17, 1903, Orville Wright conducted his historic flight with an airplane successfully. Just a few days earlier, Orville and his brother Wilbur had crashed in a test flight – one of the first documented aviation accidents in history.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, many decades later, &lt;STRONG&gt;using aircrafts is considered one of the safest travel options&lt;/STRONG&gt; (measured by distance traveled &lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety&lt;/A&gt;) – thanks to curious engineers, learnings from accidents and incidents, scientific progress, publication of relevant regulations and industry standards, and of course an ever-attentive approach to safety and security checks and improvements. We can trust planes to be safe – not per se (the owl Archimedes has a point here &lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLI46yMdtmU" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLI46yMdtmU&lt;/A&gt;) but because we have found ways to make them safe.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;fascination for machines that work similarly to the human mind&lt;/STRONG&gt; has been around for ages. The potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for adding efficiency, creativity, and inspiration to persons’ lives is immense. The nature of the technology brings also specific risks and can be scary: machines that reason and learn imply a loss of human control – a challenge that is not only (science) fiction (&lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;HAL 9000&lt;/A&gt; being just one example; for more see e. g. &lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_fiction&lt;/A&gt;) but reality (e. g. &lt;A href="https://www.aiaaic.org/aiaaic-repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;AIAAIC Incident Repository&lt;/A&gt; / &lt;A href="https://github.com/daviddao/awful-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Awful AI List&lt;/A&gt; / &lt;A href="https://incidentdatabase.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://incidentdatabase.ai/&lt;/A&gt; ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; has still a long way until it can be considered a matured technology which is as safe as air traffic has become. When it comes to AI today and going forward, we definitely want to &lt;STRONG&gt;trust, but verify&lt;/STRONG&gt;: what are the implications when implementing a specific AI system; what is the system doing and why; in case of incidents: what was causing the issue; etc. Iteratively improving technical standards and procedural governance, considering ethical and legal requirements, will enhance safety for people, environment, and society going forward. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Every framework that discusses how to make AI systems safe for usage includes a section that has to do with &lt;STRONG&gt;transparency&lt;/STRONG&gt;, including the &lt;A href="https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;UNESCO Recommendation&lt;/STRONG&gt; of the Ethics of AI&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics.html?pdf-asset=940c6047-1c7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff&amp;amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP’s Guiding Principles&lt;/STRONG&gt; for Artificial Intelligence&lt;/A&gt;, or the &lt;A href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=60419" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI by the High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the &lt;STRONG&gt;European Commission&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; (HLEG AI Ethics Guidelines). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to the HLEG AI Ethics Guidelines, “[t]rustworthy AI has &lt;STRONG&gt;three components&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which should be met throughout the system's entire life cycle: (1) it should be &lt;STRONG&gt;lawful&lt;/STRONG&gt;, complying with all applicable laws and regulations (2) it should be &lt;STRONG&gt;ethical&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensuring adherence to ethical principles and values, and (3) it should be &lt;STRONG&gt;robust&lt;/STRONG&gt;, both from a technical and social perspective.” Transparency requirements play a role in all three components, so let’s use these angles to have a closer look.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371775404"&gt;Lawful: Transparency requirements in regulatory and legal areas&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the 1920s, barnstorming and so-called flying circuses were very popular: stunt shows with daredevil pilots and acrobats executing spectacular and risky maneuvers with the plane (loopings etc.) and on the plane (wing walking). Early legislation related to civil air transportation addressed the most common causes of fatal accidents, including lack of pilot qualification and stunt practices that put the spectators’ lives at risk. Over the years, laws were passed, updated, and complemented which intended to improve aviation safety and with that, the trust of the public in the technology, with the &lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_role_in_civil_aviation#Air_Commerce_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Air Commerce Act&lt;/A&gt;, issued in 1926, as an early example, and the &lt;A href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/920/oj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/920&lt;/A&gt; for sure not the last.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Defining and implementing regulation for technologies is inherently slower than the subject it is supposed to regulate. In the context of AI, luckily some laws that provide important guardrails to protect individuals have been in place for some time, &lt;SPAN&gt;or &lt;A href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB853" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The California AI Transparency Act AB 853&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; are examples of regulation which targets the specific risks and challenges related to AI. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Individuals and legal entities have a need and partly also (will have) a &lt;STRONG&gt;right to transparency&lt;/STRONG&gt; when it comes to decisions and AI; valid questions of stakeholders include: Which role does AI play in a decision that may &lt;STRONG&gt;affect my life&lt;/STRONG&gt; going forward, and am I okay with that? Can I make an informed decision when I give &lt;STRONG&gt;consent&lt;/STRONG&gt; to using an AI system as an individual? Do I have the transparency I need to &lt;STRONG&gt;diagnose&lt;/STRONG&gt; the functioning / malfunctioning of an AI system, so that we can &lt;STRONG&gt;learn from issues&lt;/STRONG&gt; and fix them going forward? How can &lt;STRONG&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/STRONG&gt; help understand scope and limitations of AI systems?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175261899"&gt;Robust: Making AI systems secure and robust&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Aircrafts are subject to thorough inspection based on sophisticated protocols that prove their respective &lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airworthiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;airworthiness&lt;/A&gt; before they are permitted to operate. Insights from past incidents, e. g. through &lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Flight Recorder&lt;/A&gt; data, are an important resource of input for improvements of hardware, software, or procedures, to help prevent future damage and harm.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Software systems&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; need to be reliable in the sense that they work as designed and the potential risks related to their usage are minimized. &lt;STRONG&gt;Quality management&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;software&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;security &lt;/STRONG&gt;efforts and &lt;STRONG&gt;governance&lt;/STRONG&gt; in general play a critical role when creating robust software. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The same applies to the development of&lt;STRONG&gt; AI systems&lt;/STRONG&gt;, plus some extra aspects that have to do with the specific nature of those systems, in particular when they involve &lt;STRONG&gt;machine learning&lt;/STRONG&gt; capabilities or are generating output &lt;STRONG&gt;autonomously&lt;/STRONG&gt; (for definitions / distinctions of AI / ML / genAI / Agentic AI see e. g. the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/03/7211ee96-647e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI Ethics Handbook&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What role does transparency play? For example, without transparency, testing AI system robustness and reliability are a critical challenge. At the same time, we are speaking of &lt;STRONG&gt;‘black box’ systems&lt;/STRONG&gt; – how can we even understand what is going on in the system and if that is what we expect in terms of reliability, security and safety?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security testing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; of AI systems should not only look at the outcome or effect, but ideally have a certain level of insight in the processes and methods inside the system to identify root causes and potential &lt;STRONG&gt;systematic threats&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &lt;STRONG&gt;Benchmarking&lt;/STRONG&gt; of models or AI systems help understand / ‘diagnose’ the quality and reliability and trigger mitigation as needed, runtime &lt;STRONG&gt;monitoring and traceability&lt;/STRONG&gt; help prevent unintended and unwanted shifts in an AI system’s performance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Software companies can leverage guidelines and recommendations (e. g. &lt;A href="https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-testing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;OWASP AI Testing Guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;), applicable industry standards (i.e &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:9001:ed-5:v1:en" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ISO 9001 Quality Management System&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:27001:ed-3:v1:en" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ISO/IEC 27001 Security Management System&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;), and adjust and complement according to the specifics of e. g. the industry or the regional context. Documenting the &lt;STRONG&gt;compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt; with relevant standards, including &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;NIST AI Risk Management Framework RMF&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:42001:ed-1:v1:en" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management Systems&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, helps build trust in the responsible development of AI systems in customers (see e. g. the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Trust Center&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;) and the general public. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-978748394"&gt;Ethical: Human oversight&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;How come airplane engineers invent seatbelts for pilots and passengers, and why was there an affordance to adjust law and regulation to reduce accidents and harm related to air traffic? Costs related to damages and injuries may have played a role, but without doubt also: empathy and ethical considerations. Situations where people lose loved ones, suffer from severe injury or face damages to their property are something to be avoided, and there is a strong motivation to reduce risks leading to them and to strengthen the public’s &lt;STRONG&gt;trust in the technology and its operation&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, there are AI-related legal requirements for transparency, and technical robustness is a prerequisite for AI systems that can be trusted. Relying on current or upcoming (known) regulation only when working on AI safety is not a sustainable approach: Technology is evolving too fast to allow regulatory processes to keep up and put legal boundaries in place. Thinking only in terms of current rules and potential gaps between them will turn legally compliant innovation into a ‘jigsaw puzzle with moving parts’: Legal gaps you designed for may be closing in due course, and every new regulation poses a threat to the products in the portfolio or on the roadmap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The ethical perspective on the other hand changes the focus from legal texts and fear of being sued, towards the vision to what we want the technology to do and what needs to be avoided. AI Ethics principles help &lt;STRONG&gt;inform legislation&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but also provide &lt;STRONG&gt;guidance for technical innovation&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Not just do what is feasible, but think what is acceptable and desirable going forward&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, for us as individuals, for us as a company, and for us as a society. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One example: The &lt;A href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HLEG AI Ethics Guidelines&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; name &lt;STRONG&gt;fairness&lt;/STRONG&gt; as an &lt;STRONG&gt;ethical imperative for trustworthy AI&lt;/STRONG&gt; as early as&lt;STRONG&gt; 2016&lt;/STRONG&gt;. SAP committed to fairness in the Guiding Principles for the Ethics of AI in &lt;STRONG&gt;2018&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The &lt;STRONG&gt;EU AI Act&lt;/STRONG&gt; entered into force in 2024, with certain provisions applying immediately and others phased in over time, reaching full applicability by &lt;STRONG&gt;2027&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Given the risks related to AI, we want to ensure that &lt;STRONG&gt;humans&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;control AI systems as needed, and not the other way around&lt;/STRONG&gt;. A prerequisite to ensure human agency and oversight: Transparency. You can’t control what you don’t know or understand. Measures like &lt;STRONG&gt;explainability&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;interpretability&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;traceability&lt;/STRONG&gt; are required to allow humans in their respective capacity and interaction with AI systems to stay in control, acquire knowledge, and gain &lt;STRONG&gt;trust&lt;/STRONG&gt; and confidence that the AI is &lt;STRONG&gt;not creating any harm&lt;/STRONG&gt;, neither to the &lt;STRONG&gt;individual&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;society&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;I&gt;,&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; nor &lt;STRONG&gt;environment&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-782234889"&gt;Different perspectives on transparency for responsible AI&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The blogpost series will take the perspective of &lt;STRONG&gt;different stakeholders in the lifecycle of AI systems&lt;/STRONG&gt;, including those who are “designing, developing, deploying, implementing, using or being affected by AI” (&lt;A href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;HLEG AI Ethics Guidelines&lt;/A&gt;). SAP experts will shed light on different aspects and approaches, from a &lt;STRONG&gt;legal&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a&lt;STRONG&gt; technical&lt;/STRONG&gt;, or an&lt;STRONG&gt; ethical &lt;/STRONG&gt;viewpoint, providing insights into challenges and solutions, considering &lt;STRONG&gt;organizational practices&lt;/STRONG&gt; as well as &lt;STRONG&gt;user needs &lt;/STRONG&gt;and &lt;STRONG&gt;customer expectations&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Examples from &lt;STRONG&gt;real SAP use cases&lt;/STRONG&gt; will illustrate the practical relevance and the efforts SAP is taking to build AI systems responsibly and create transparency so that stakeholders are enabled and empowered to understand risks and benefits, and execute on human oversight.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blogpost will be updated with references whenever a new post is available to make it easy to get notified and find the information you are interested in.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-585721384"&gt;Closing&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When on an airplane, in most situations you would want to know that the skies are above you and the ground is beneath you (exceptions include flying circuses, see above). In any case, at least the pilot should know about the current orientation of the aircraft, even if weather conditions are blocking the sight of the actual surroundings. If the physical horizon is not visible, the attitude indicator, an instrument mimicking the blue skies above an artificial horizon and a brown ground below, will help adjust the plane’s orientation. &lt;STRONG&gt;Blue side up&lt;/STRONG&gt;, brown side down means that the plane is not going astray, neither upwards nor downwards – a means to keep orientation and an &lt;STRONG&gt;indicator of aviation safety&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We trust airplanes not because they are perfect and unbreakable. But because we know about their challenges, weaknesses, what to check, what to look at, how to optimize human-machine collaboration. And we have found ways to surface the information that is needed – by pilots, by engineers, by passengers, or in other words: leverage transparency to foster safety.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Meaningful transparency is ‘in the eye of the beholder’. Its design needs a human-centered approach to provide just the right angle, level, and amount of information that is relevant and helpful for individuals to interpret the situation, to “&lt;EM&gt;&lt;I&gt;make sense, or derive meaning, from a given stimulus […] so that the human can make a decision”&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; (&lt;A href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2021/NIST.IR.8367.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Broniatowski, 2021&lt;/A&gt;) – a prerequisite for human oversight and trustworthy AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-right" image-alt="295087_GettyImages-95757310_medium_jpg.jpg" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343645i5F0DF1C8D73EB027/image-size/small/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="295087_GettyImages-95757310_medium_jpg.jpg" alt="295087_GettyImages-95757310_medium_jpg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let us share how &lt;STRONG&gt;AI transparency&lt;/STRONG&gt;

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763841530"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introduction&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Industrial manufacturing is at a crossroads. The industry faces mounting pressures from global market shifts, technological advancements, and the imperative to operate more sustainably. At the same time, new opportunities are emerging for those ready to embrace change. As the industry evolves, the ability to adapt quickly, innovate continuously, and build resilient operations has become essential. This post explores how SAP Cloud ERP as part of SAP Business Suite is enabling industrial manufacturers navigate this transformation, drawing on the latest insights from our industry update with the 2508 release.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Watch the full recording here: &lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/live-sessions/industrial-manufacturing-industry-update-pet-h2-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Industrial Manufacturing Industry Update - PET H2 2025&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567328025"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Evolving Landscape of Industrial Manufacturing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Industrial manufacturing companies are defined by their ability to transform raw materials into finished goods at scale, serving a wide range of markets from household appliances to heavy equipment. Many organizations operate across several industry subsegments, often as a result of mergers and acquisitions, which adds complexity to their operations and increases the demands placed on their ERP systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Today’s manufacturers are not only expected to deliver high-quality products efficiently but also to manage increasingly complex supply chains, comply with evolving regulations, and respond to rapid changes in customer demand. The need for robust, flexible, and integrated business systems has never been greater.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1370814520"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Challenges and Industry Trends&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recent industry studies and ongoing engagement with customers have highlighted several persistent challenges. Business growth remains a top priority, with manufacturers seeking to attract new customers and enter new markets. However, legacy systems often lack the capabilities needed to support new business models or the localization required for global expansion. Supply chain resilience is another critical concern. Manufacturers are striving to build closer relationships with suppliers and gain deeper visibility into their supply chains, but many lack the systems to enable real-time insights or to streamline the onboarding of new partners.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Operational efficiency is also under pressure. Companies are looking to maximize the effectiveness of both machines and workforce, often through automation and upskilling. Yet, manual processes and limited visibility into production capacity can hinder progress. Finally, technology adoption remains a challenge. Many manufacturers are still reliant on inflexible legacy systems, with data locked away in silos and not easily accessible for business decision-making. The transition to cloud-based, data-driven operations is essential for unlocking new value and staying competitive with the help of AI.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174301015"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP’s Approach: Building the Intelligent, Sustainable Enterprise&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Cloud ERP is designed to address these challenges head-on. The solution provides a strong foundation for industrial manufacturers, offering pre-configured, ready-to-run, end-to-end scenarios that can be deployed quickly and adapted as business needs evolve. Integration with SAP Business Technology Platform and a broad ecosystem of SAP and Partner solutions ensures that customers can support their unique processes while benefiting from continuous innovation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A key strength of SAP’s approach is its support for both headquarter scenarios and subsidiaries through two-tier ERP models. This enables organizations to maintain strict governance and standardization at the corporate level while allowing subsidiaries the flexibility to operate in ways that best suit their local markets or distinct business models.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-977787510"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;End-to-End Scenarios for Modern Manufacturing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Cloud ERP supports a wide range of manufacturing archetypes, each tailored to the specific needs of different industry segments. E.g. for component manufacturers, make-to-stock scenarios enable efficient production planning, procurement, and sales from inventory. Machinery manufacturers benefit from assemble-to-order and configure-to-order processes, which provide the flexibility to meet individual customer requirements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;End-to-end scenarios are designed to span the entire industrial manufacturing value chain, from idea to market, source to pay, plan to fulfill, and lead to cash. By connecting every part of the business, manufacturers gain greater visibility, control, and the ability to respond quickly to changing conditions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781274005"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Innovations in the SAP Cloud ERP 2508 Release&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The latest release of SAP Cloud ERP brings several important enhancements for industrial manufacturers. In production planning and execution, the capacity scheduling board introduces activity coloring, allowing production planners to distinguish between setup, production, and teardown times at a glance. This provides clearer insights into operations and helps optimize resource utilization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_1cb6ppu9" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Component availability checks have also been added to the capacity scheduling table, enabling planners to verify that all necessary parts are on stock before scheduling production orders, thus reducing the risk of costly delays.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_k3t51ak9" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-Assisted Processing of Incoming Quality Certificates with SAP Document AI automatically processes incoming quality certificate documents. By leveraging SAP Document AI on BTP, the data extraction and automatic attachment of certificates to relevant receipts become a hassle-free reality. This allows to handle certificates more efficiently and helps ensure that nothing is lost or overlooked.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_8iqjpmzs" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In sales management, SAP’s AI copilot, Joule, can now handle expiring prices, automate renewals, and identify fulfillment issues in sales orders, helping sales teams work more efficiently and proactively.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_hobyopp3" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Advanced Variant Configuration capabilities have also been enhanced. Multi-level bills of materials can now be downloaded for easier comparison, and configurations can be imported from sales documents for reuse, streamlining the process of managing complex product variants.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_y3oac71z" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_y14d5m35" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-584760500"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customer Success Stories: Real-World Impact&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The value of SAP Cloud ERP is best illustrated through the experiences of leading industrial manufacturers. &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/07/8ecec030-147f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;DINE Inc.&lt;/A&gt;, a South Korean manufacturer specializing in high-precision machining tools, faced challenges with an outdated ERP system that hindered digital transformation and data reliability. By implementing SAP Cloud ERP, DINE achieved unified accounting management across global operations, standardized workflows, and enhanced data visibility. The results included a doubling of profit and loss analysis accuracy, a 1.5-fold increase in inventory turnover rate, and a 10% reduction in spare parts inventory value.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2025/09/0cb9afb9-1f7f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Tetra Pak eBeam Systems AG&lt;/A&gt;, headquartered in Switzerland, sought to modernize operations after being acquired by Tetra Pak in 2020. By adopting SAP Cloud ERP and leveraging the SAP Activate methodology, the company reduced upgrade preparation time from eight hours to two, improved user experience, and enabled IT resources to focus on strategic initiatives.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Other customers, such as &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/pdf/asset/preview/H1GJdct?ltr=a&amp;amp;rc=68&amp;amp;doi=SAP1117756" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Acceleron&lt;/A&gt; and Ferrotec, have also realized significant benefits. Acceleron consolidated more than 20 ERP systems into a single global business foundation in the cloud, enabling unified processes across 40 countries. &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2024/10/f0cffe1d-e07e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Ferrotec Manufacturing Malaysia Sdn.

We do not assume the future of purchasing looks the same for all companies. Rather, key trends and key technologies play a big role. Their impact varies greatly depending on the industry and business model.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The shaping trends for purchasing (as well as for the other parts of the supply chain) include the global economic situation and geopolitical tensions, the growing importance of sustainability, the scarcity of raw materials, and the changes for the people involved. These issues are not new, but they will play a major role in the coming years and will sometimes become even bigger.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key technologies are in the focus, e.g. integrated transactional purchasing applications with new semantic data models, AI agents, AI-based data analyses, and insights from the evaluation of information from business networks. Artificial intelligence is not the only driving technology but will become increasingly relevant in the coming years. No process in modern purchasing organizations will remain unaffected by its influence. Against this background, purchasing organizations have to work out which trends and technologies are particularly important for their company to plan the path to a successful future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The study conducted an online survey of 174 supply chain managers with people responsibility (April 2025). There was a clear discrepancy between ambitious visions for the future and the sad reality. On the one hand, 28% of respondents expected purchasing managers to play an important role in shaping corporate strategy and security of supply in 2035, while 31% expected buying organizations to achieve significantly better AI-driven outcomes with high quality data. On the other hand, only 12% say that procurement in their organization is now fully integrated into C-level decision-making, and only 3% think AI-powered purchasing analytics are great today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How should this discrepancy be dealt with? And how to deal with the uncertainty of every look into the future? The clear recommendation for all purchasing organizations is to do their homework first, to take decisions and to perform a couple of no-regret moves. It is clear that only purchasing organizations following these five important points are optimally positioned for the coming years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Firstly, clearly defined strategies and responsible people are in place for the most important categories and sub-categories. These category strategies must be kept up to date in suitable applications instead of gathering dust in presentations stored on shared drives. The strategies will be the trigger for activities, and the focal point for monitoring the progress of the activities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Secondly, the operating model of the purchasing organization must be optimized by shifting personnel capacities from administrative activities to value-adding tasks. The goal is to work with a small but highly skilled workforce.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Third, clearly defined and standardized processes are required that exist in Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) notation and are mapped in a process management solution, not a drawing tool. On this basis, simulations and comparisons of as-is and to-be can be carried out. Also, the processes can be linked to business requirements, test cases, application documentation, driving AI based automation in these related activities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fourth, modern purchasing applications should be used to support end-to-end processes, without media breaks and with a steadily growing degree of automation. An end-to-end flow of data and information is essential. Specifications and prices belong into the apps themselves, not in file attachments. These pieces of information are critical parts of the data that drives AI. Similarly, the apps must be integrated so data is not transferred manually or via bots.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fifth, all relevant data from various procurement apps and third-party data must be available for analysis. The key is that this data is available on an appropriate platform and mapped to a semantic model. This is the only way to get an overview of the entire purchasing process, to derive in-depth insights and to drive more AI use cases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The last point is of particular importance. Only if data on purchasing processes is available in structured form, across all purchasing processes, in good quality, will the purchasing organization have a solid basis for using AI functionalities of any kind, especially AI-driven analytics and AI agents, which can take on complex tasks on their own.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI agents sound a bit like science fiction for many persons in the procurement space – that is why the figure below outlines an agentic AI scenario in strategic procurement. The CPO sets a task for a procurement orchestration agent which in turn sets tasks for other, more specialized procurement agents (e.g. spend analysis, sourcing activities, contract creation) to achieve an overall goal, the optimization of a specific sub-category.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similarly, all other parties involved in the purchasing processes can be supported. Requestors can interact with an operational purchasing agents to quickly and clearly describe their needs. That operational purchasing agent reaches out to other agents leveraging existing contracts or catalogs, adhering to all purchasing guidelines, and covering topics such as account assignment, tax determination, and transportation costs. With the help of their own agents, suppliers will find it easy to participate in complex tenders, bid in Dutch or Japanese auctions, negotiate and sign contracts, and provide price lists and catalogs in specific formats to the purchasing organization. Since suppliers will use their own AI agents, there will be an increasing frequency of interaction between multiple agents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In summary, it can be said that those purchasing organizations will be optimally positioned for the future, who correctly classify the relevance of future trends and technologies to their own business, and who conclude the five no-regret moves mentioned above.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="marcus_mock_1-1764144277645.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345277iDB02DA211AADEFBC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="marcus_mock_1-1764144277645.png" alt="marcus_mock_1-1764144277645.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Figure: AI agents implement a complex task in purchasing&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This article was written in collaboration with Prof. Kai Hoberg (Kühne Logistics University) in the context of the SAP-KLU study "The Supply Chain of the Future”.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Imagine a global retailer preparing for the holiday season, a time when system stability is paramount. In previous years, unexpected disruptions caused delays and customer dissatisfaction. This year, things are different. By implementing proactive monitoring powered by AI and Collective Intelligence, the retailer identified early signals of potential issues weeks before peak demand. This story exemplifies how proactive monitoring transforms support from reactive firefighting to predictive prevention.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2023859744"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Proactive Monitoring Matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Proactive monitoring reduces escalations, improves customer confidence, and optimizes operations. Instead of waiting for incidents to occur, we anticipate them, ensuring uninterrupted business continuity. For example, during the Holiday Season Readiness Program, proactive monitoring helped SAP support teams detect anomalies in critical systems, preventing potential outages for major e-commerce customers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1827346239"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How It Works&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The process begins with comprehensive data collection—telemetry from cloud systems, business process data, and historical case patterns. AI-driven algorithms then analyze these inputs to recognize patterns and correlate events. When anomalies are detected, automated workflows trigger alerts and initiate Preventive Customer Risk Mitigation actions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1630832734"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Breaking Data Silos&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Success depends on breaking down data silos. Only by building a Collective Intelligence framework—where insights from global case data, configuration logs, and usage analytics converge—can this model be scaled across the entire customer base. As data needs to be used collaboratively, data sharing enables an environment where information is accessible in a timely manner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1434319229"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Among the benefits of proactive monitoring, they can range from faster root cause analysis to reduced mean time to resolution. The first refers to the process of identification of causes and reasons for an issue taking place, and the latter concerns the measurement of how quickly a system responds to a failure once it is recognized. Both play a part in refining the customer experience through invisible, but automated support.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="JeaneFerreira_0-1764233626580.png" style="width: 706px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345763i03DC1DFD8A84FD58/image-dimensions/706x381/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="706" height="381" role="button" title="JeaneFerreira_0-1764233626580.png" alt="JeaneFerreira_0-1764233626580.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the proactive monitoring strategy anchored in AI, retailers can turn their peak shopping seasons from difficult periods into opportunities for improving customer engagement and operational resilience. A continued adoption of AI-driven capabilities is what will enable smarter planning and sustainable data-driven growth. strategic AI adoption and thoughtful implementation will drive retail excellence in an increasingly digital and data-driven world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A special thanks to SAP experts Bharath Ramamurthy, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, Customer Support, and Kartikaye Gomber, AI Solution Architect, for their contributions to this article.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Consider a scenario where a critical update is scheduled for a financial services customer ahead of a major fiscal event. Traditionally, risks would surface post-deployment, leading to costly escalations. That is where a shift to the left walks into the stage: as the testing and detection steps are moved earlier into the lifecycle, an eventual delay in release is avoided, as well as the increase in costs associated with fixings issues. In other words, shifting to left is like reserving the seat in the first rows for testing!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At first glance, it may appear that risks are put in the spotlight, much like nominees at an award show. However, in reality, this approach aims at reducing them. Early recognition of potential issues enables development teams to allocate more time to data cleansing and preparation, tasks that typically consume a significant part of their efforts. This proactive approach allows for more focus on generating valuable insights rather than dealing with escalations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2023859811"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Does Shift Left Mean?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Shift Left involves moving risk detection and mitigation earlier in the lifecycle. This approach reduces downstream support costs and enhances customer satisfaction. During the Holiday Season Readiness Program, Shift Left strategies ensured that preventive controls were in place well before peak transaction periods. These strategies included:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Implementing Preventive Customer Risk Mitigation workflows for early alerts and automated case creation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integrating with Cloud ALM for lifecycle event monitoring&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Defining governance models for clear ownership of risk mitigation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1827346306"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Predictive Intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Predictive intelligence uses Collective Intelligence to aggregate insights from global case data and apply AI models for event-to-issue correlation. This enables proactive actions that prevent disruptions before they impact customers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1630832801"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Breaking Data Silos for Scale&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Scaling this model requires dismantling data silos. By pooling insights across teams and regions, we create a unified intelligence network capable of supporting our entire customer base efficiently. With reliable data through the software deployment process, customers can make well-informed decisions at all stages of their businesses, that could lead to better budget management likewise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1434319296"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Impact&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;This method is aligned with SAP’s vision for an effortless customer experience. It reduces escalations and downtime while improving operational efficiency. By incorporating recurrent tests at every step of the development process, the system is continuously reviewed and adjusted as needed. Just as filming involves many behind-the-scenes teams, a shift to the left ensures that the backstage engines are aware and constantly prepared for the result that customers witness.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In conclusion, the Shift Left approach changes traditional development and deployment processes by proactively addressing risks and issues earlier in the lifecycle. When customers operate their businesses smoothly and stay well-prepared, we join forces to lay the foundation for lasting success and sustained trust.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A sincere thank you to SAP experts Bharath Ramamurthy, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, Customer Support, and Kartikaye Gomber, AI Solution Architect, for their contributions to this article&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The shift towards a skills-based workforce is picking up speed, and this transformation lives or dies on one thing: your skills architecture, the foundation that defines:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;how skills are structured,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;how they are governed,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;how they flow through your HRtech landscape, and&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;how employees, managers, and admins actually experience them.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s happening -&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF6600"&gt;Most organizations jump straight into “skills projects” without stopping to define the design decisions that truly matter!&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;I have seen SAP SuccessFactors customers engaging with different HRTech or Skills vendors separately, rather than as a coherent group. The result? Duplicate skills across systems, messy job profiles, confused employees, frustrated managers, and governance models held together with duct tape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of this blog as your Skills Architecture Playbook: the 10 decisions every company must get right to build a clean, future-proof foundation with &lt;STRONG&gt;Talent Intelligence Hub&lt;/STRONG&gt;. These decisions will shape everything from AI models and inference reliability to employee growth journeys and manager adoption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’re implementing TIH, planning a Skills Transformation, or just trying to bring order to the skills chaos, this guide is for you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s get into the decisions that define your success.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1765602950"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;Leading Practice Skills Architecture with Talent Intelligence Hub&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s a leading practice approach for designing a Skills Architecture with TIH at its core. Open Skills Ecosystem (OSE) partners help augment and complement customers' internal data, creating a high-quality skills foundation that brings together market skills data, job and work insights, and people attributes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once standardized in Talent Intelligence Hub and enriched with employee and organizational master data from SuccessFactors, this unified skills intelligence can be delivered through Career and Talent Development (CTD) as the experience layer for every persona -employees, managers, HR, recruiters, and leaders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1827254883"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF6600"&gt;I had shared this diagram in my session at SuccessConnect and have further explained it in my podcast.

Choose Your System of Record: Where Does Job &amp;amp; Skills Truth Live?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Everything starts with a single question:&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color="#FF6600"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Where does the truth sit?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For job architecture and skills governance, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SuccessFactors Talent Intelligence Hub&lt;/STRONG&gt; should be your system of record and governance layer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s how it breaks down:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TIH + JPB = Your Master Foundation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Job Families&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Job Roles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Job Profiles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Skills Library&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Skills tagged to roles and profiles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;JPB&lt;/STRONG&gt; holds your job architecture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Open Skills Ecosystem partners&lt;/STRONG&gt; enrich your skills library.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TIH&lt;/STRONG&gt; governs and standardizes everything.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Get this foundation right, and the rest of your skills strategy becomes infinitely easier.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1176062435"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Standardize Skills in the Attributes Library with AI Skills Standardization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once you know where the truth lives, the next step is: &lt;FONT color="#800080"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What does that truth look like?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Attributes Library&lt;/STRONG&gt; in TIH is your governance layer for all skills master data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It helps you:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Maintain a clean, unified skills library.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Standardizes the Skills data into one common language.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage lifecycle states (active, deprecated, standardized)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Standardize proficiency scales&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your Open Skills Ecosystem partner sends business- and industry-relevant skill data &lt;EM&gt;into&lt;/EM&gt; TIH, where you standardize it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This avoids:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Duplicate skills&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Confusing naming conventions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Skill inflation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Random “HR-created” one-off skills&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is your quality control engine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1237714368"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF6600"&gt;Check out my&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rinkykarthik_new-segment-alchemy-bits-bytes-2h-activity-7397488637870874624-Y0Vg?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAAADZ4I8Bk_dQ_vToHYD2zCLPIpLudIp9MQU" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Talent Alchemy Bits and Bytes&lt;/A&gt; &lt;FONT color="#FF6600"&gt;segment, where I talked about Skills Standardization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-783035425"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3.

Choose What Skills You will Infer and from Where?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Skill inferencing is magical… unless it pulls the wrong signals.&amp;nbsp;You need to define:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What external sources can infer skills?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Project systems&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Legacy HR/LMS tools&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;External learning platforms&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Gig/mobility platforms&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Assessment vendors&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How will you judge quality?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Set thresholds such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Evidence required&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Confidence level&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Relevance to job or industry&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Duplication rules&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Which SF processes continuously infer skills?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Learning completions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Internal gigs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Performance achievements&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Career development activities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;A thoughtful inferencing strategy prevents “noise skills” and keeps your profiles trustworthy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-193494910"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#3366FF"&gt;6.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The oil and gas domain has historically been one of the most stable but also conservative areas of enterprise architecture. Over multiple decades, SAP customers have evolved from custom ABAP solutions to standardized S/4HANA objects, Fiori applications, and integrated complex logistics planning and processes. While this has driven consistency and transactional efficiency, the &lt;STRONG&gt;core decision-making mechanisms in field logistics remained predominantly human-driven&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;with, manual validation, and the experience of field and personnel&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Field Logistics is a solution built on SAP S/4HANA. It is available on both S/4HANA private cloud and public cloud.&amp;nbsp; This solution enables customers leverage best in class industry practices to manage the logistics movement of their own- and third-party items between their supply and demand plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are happy to announce that in &lt;STRONG&gt;May 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we at SAP introduced a landmark innovation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;the very first Joule-enabled capability across all industries, delivered specifically within SAP Upstream Field Logistics.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This early release is subtle in scope but monumental in strategic significance. It marks the beginning of Field Logistics evolution from traditional business processes to a future where core FL operations become deeply AI-driven through Joule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Strategic First Step: Joule’s Inventory Insights for FL&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The initial capability released in May focuses on a &lt;STRONG&gt;read-only non-stock inventory scenario&lt;/STRONG&gt;, allowing users to retrieve consolidated product and equipment visibility through natural language and gives the latest milestone of its lifecycle to help to know where the equipment is located. Even though this first use case is intentionally controlled, it is designed as the &lt;STRONG&gt;foundation for a multi-release future where Joule will perform full field logistics (FL) transactions end-to-end&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP’s intention is clear:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Start small, prove value, ensure reliability, and then scale AI-driven operations across the entire upstream lifecycle.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This first release demonstrates Joule’s ability to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Understand Field Logistics terminology in 50 different languages&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Interpret users queries through Natural Language Processing and provide contextual answers instantly&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Display list of products along with relevant information’s like plant, Purchase order, different quantities etc&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigate to Manage logistics application from Joule to get a wholistic view&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While simple on the surface, the underlying architecture sets the stage for powerful, future-ready logistics automation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What This Means for Customers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Faster, simpler access to operational intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Users can ask Joule questions in natural language — no need to navigate complex screens or interpret multiple reports.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Immediate visibility where it matters most&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Inventory and material readiness have direct impact on non-productive time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A future-proof foundation for autonomous logistics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This first release is intentionally scoped — but designed for expansion into item receival, returns process, and more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A clear step toward an “AI co-pilot” for upstream operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule is not just a search tool. It is the beginning of a more intelligent, proactive, and predictive logistics environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Highlights Behind the Scenes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the customer experience focuses on simplicity, the technical implementation is sophisticated:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SrinivasaMural_0-1764575303042.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346883i4874BCB8FAF73DFB/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SrinivasaMural_0-1764575303042.png" alt="SrinivasaMural_0-1764575303042.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Flow Diagram&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SrinivasaMural_1-1764575303045.jpeg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346882iFEFF45DEE8079013/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SrinivasaMural_1-1764575303045.jpeg" alt="SrinivasaMural_1-1764575303045.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Semantic Understanding of FL and S/4HANA Operational Objects&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule interprets upstream-specific structures such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Field Logistics items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;PO, GR, Open and Return quantity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Latest Milestone&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Non-stock Inventory availability data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This domain-awareness is what enables Joule to deliver precise, contextual answers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Natural Language → CDS Query Generation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule automatically translates plain language into data retrieval operations using:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CDS consumption views&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;FL OData APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This eliminates the need for custom queries or separate analytical tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Functionality&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Do follow the below link to understand about Joule and how to access the same in a Private Cloud system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-a-comprehensive-setup-guide/ba-p/13786453" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-a-comprehensive-setup-guide/ba-p/13786453&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once you login to your Fiori system as a Supply Chain Analyst persona and click on the Joule icon at the top, all the capabilities that are part of your user role will be available. Users also can click on helpful conversation starters instead of asking a question.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SrinivasaMural_2-1764575303054.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346884i76CE0445FF451CF0/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SrinivasaMural_2-1764575303054.png" alt="SrinivasaMural_2-1764575303054.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Certain mandatory parameters are needed to process the user utterance, for our capability the item number/ description must be provided. Additionally, optional parameters like plant could also be provided to narrow down the search results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SrinivasaMural_3-1764575303061.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346886i65229D4E405754C3/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SrinivasaMural_3-1764575303061.png" alt="SrinivasaMural_3-1764575303061.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule displays a list of items that are relevant for your search along with some important fields such as PO and item, Latest Milestone.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SrinivasaMural_4-1764575303073.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346887i753E5B98441923FD/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SrinivasaMural_4-1764575303073.png" alt="SrinivasaMural_4-1764575303073.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can click on each entry which would take you to a detail view wherein additional fields such as Order and various quantities can be viewed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SrinivasaMural_5-1764575303079.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346885i23AEAED06173E85F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SrinivasaMural_5-1764575303079.png" alt="SrinivasaMural_5-1764575303079.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also, there is a button at the bottom which can be used to Navigate to Manage Logistics application that filters the data already entered by the user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SrinivasaMural_6-1764575303091.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346888iAB2B2AACEB80985D/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SrinivasaMural_6-1764575303091.png" alt="SrinivasaMural_6-1764575303091.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customer-Focused Future Roadmap&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has already signalled a &lt;STRONG&gt;multi-release roadmap&lt;/STRONG&gt; to expand Joule’s Oil and Gas capabilities beyond visibility into actionable intelligence and automated logistics execution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Future Vision&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This progression reflects SAP’s commitment to &lt;STRONG&gt;controlled, safe, value-driven rollout of Joule capabilities to field logistics operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion: A Small Release with a Massive Strategic Horizon&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The May 2025 Joule capability for FL may be limited to inventory visibility, but it represents:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;first-ever Joule release across industries&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The foundation of AI-enriched S/4HANA FL operations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The beginning of SAP’s broader AI transformation across line-of-business functions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customers leveraging this early capability are not just gaining a new feature—they are positioning themselves at the &lt;STRONG&gt;frontline of an industry-wide shift&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where SAP systems evolve from transactional engines to &lt;STRONG&gt;intelligent co-pilots for complex field logistics operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

To do this, participants first complete a critical thinking test with the help of an AI agent. In a second part of the study, this test is replaced with a realistic task from the field of sustainability management requiring critical thinking. This part takes place in the KD²lab and is supplemented by additional measurement methods such as eye tracking.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ultimately, Anna Sommer's goal is to develop guidelines for AI agents that actively foster critical thinking rather than hinder it—an ability that is becoming increasingly vital for businesses striving for sustainable success.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1304276476"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":speech_balloon:"&gt;💬&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Get in Touch with the SAP Research Community&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Want to participate or know more about the partnership between SAP and KIT?

In times of global change, digital disruption, and growing demands for sustainability, it has a key role to play.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The production of the future is networked, flexible, and data driven. Leveraging technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, it is increasingly growing together with other areas of the supply chain. This development is giving rise to a digital ecosystem in which real-time data availability enables faster and more accurate decision-making across the entire supply chain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the same time, production is gaining strategic importance: Companies are relocating manufacturing processes closer to sales markets to reduce their dependency on global disruptions – a trend that has been further amplified by the pandemic, energy crisis, and geopolitical tensions. In addition, there is increasing regulatory pressure and simultaneous efforts to produce more sustainably and to use resources more efficiently. All of this must be achieved while maintaining the lowest possible production costs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In short, production is not merely one element of the supply chain, but the driving force behind its future. It determines how resilient, climate-friendly, and innovative businesses can operate tomorrow. The fourth part of the study by SAP Business Consulting and Kühne Logistics University on “Supply Chain 2035” therefore focuses on production.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The result of the study clearly highlights that the vision of a connected, AI-powered, and sustainable factory has long since arrived in the minds of many manufacturing managers – yet its implementation is still at the beginning in many places. There is a noticeable gap in maturity between the ambitions for 2035 and today's reality. While many organizations have already formulated a clear vision for the future, operational execution often remains fragmented and experimental.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The gap in sustainability and the circular economy is particularly striking. Circular production models and closed-loop material cycles are seen as key pillars of future value creation but are currently only implemented sporadically. Product designs that facilitate recycling, reuse, and modular construction are often still in the early stages of development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Achieving digital continuity represents another major challenge. While connected, data-driven control is considered a prerequisite for the smart factory; data landscapes are often fragmented. The lack of interoperability and inconsistent standards makes it difficult to leverage production and supply chain information end-to-end.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similarly, the deployment of artificial intelligence falls short of expectations. Many companies are experimenting with AI-powered applications, but the leap from pilot projects to widespread deployment is still pending. In addition, data quality and availability remain critical bottlenecks. Without clean, consistent, and connected data, every digital initiative remains piecemeal. It is only on this basis that intelligent systems can be scaled, and factories can be managed holistically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, organizational structures are undergoing transformation. Many companies are moving from experimentation to scaling – a process that requires not only new technologies, but also new skills, structures, and leadership approaches. Transforming production therefore entails not just digitalization but a fundamental shift in the interaction between people, machines, and data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The study underscores that while the path towards the factory of the future is charted, many pillars are still under construction. Success will depend on consistently linking technological and organizational building blocks. The factory of the future will not emerge from isolated innovations, but from the integrated interplay of data, technologies, and resource-efficient processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347872i420615AEBF98885F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture1.png" alt="Picture1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Figure 1: What the Data Really Shows – Current Studies briefly&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The factory of 2035 will differ fundamentally from what we are used to today. It is no longer a production system of siloed processes, but part of an intelligent, globally connected value-creating ecosystem. Data forms its central raw material – flowing through all systems in real time, connecting design, manufacturing, logistics, and recycling to a dynamic and adaptive cycle. The decisions are increasingly taken by artificial intelligence. It controls material flows, optimizes production plans, and detects deviations and disruptions early and preventively. Human expertise will thus shift toward strategic, creative, and monitoring tasks – AI becomes the central instance of production.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The physical factory itself becomes autonomous and modular. Production lines adapt in real time to changing orders, materials, or energy availability. Mobile robots, self-learning systems, and digital platforms orchestrate processes largely independently.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the same time, the paradigm shifts from linear to circular production. Closed loops are emerging; products are designed in a modular manner and optimized for reuse or remanufacturing. Digital twins and IoT data connect the physical and digital worlds. Each manufacturing step, component, and usage generates data that makes the life cycle of a product fully traceable. This digital memory not only enables precise traceability, but also predictive maintenance, accurate material returns, and the continuous improvement of future product designs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In summary: Industrial transformation is more than technological modernization – it is a cultural change. The factory of 2035 becomes a reality where data intelligence and circular thinking become part of the company’s DNA – not as an isolated project, but as a foundational principle. Those who actively shape this change not only strengthen their efficiency, but also their ability to reinvent themselves in an increasingly interconnected and dynamic industry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This article was written in collaboration with Prof. Kai Hoberg (Kühne Logistics University) in the context of the SAP-KLU study "The Supply Chain of the Future”.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In April this year, I decided to voluntarily&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/so-this-is-it-i-m-verped/ba-p/14068989" target="_self"&gt;retire early from SAP&lt;/A&gt; after 6 years of a very interesting journey. Indeed, I've lived from the inside the infusion of powerful Artificial Intelligence capabilities in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Build/pd-p/73555000100700001491" target="_self"&gt;SAP Build&lt;/A&gt;, for &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-build-sap-build-code-when-generative-ai-comes-to-help/ba-p/13584227" target="_self"&gt;application development&lt;/A&gt; and for &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/generative-ai-boosting-process-automation-come-see-our-the-results-at-sap/ba-p/13709057" target="_self"&gt;process automation&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since then, I've spent 8 months observing the IT industry evolution, particularly around AI. And now, I have very mixed feelings:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✔️&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;On one hand, I'm impressed how well SAP is positioned on the market and how SAP AI is powerful&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":question_mark:"&gt;❓&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;On the other hand, I'm more and more worried by the impact humanoid robots and AI, from SAP and all vendors, will have on so many jobs everywhere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So I decided to share my views with you in this blog post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766433166"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP is amazingly well positioned with Business AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;A month ago I watched SAP &lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9qHsLmPMk4" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;TechEd Keynote&lt;/A&gt; and also a few sessions, and I have to say that I'm impressed. By the way, in case you missed it, watch the replay of the keynote:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FX9qHsLmPMk4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX9qHsLmPMk4&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FX9qHsLmPMk4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="400" height="225" scrolling="no" title="Keynote: How SAP is Supercharging Developers for What's Next | AI &amp;amp; Agents | SAP TechEd 2025" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I discovered AI &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/blog-it-forward-pierre-col/ba-p/13449598" target="_self"&gt;more than 40 years ago&lt;/A&gt;,&lt;/STRONG&gt; when I was studying to graduate in 1986 as an engineer in computing science, and 10 years ago I was working for &lt;A href="https://www.fluidtopics.com/antidot-company/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Antidot&lt;/A&gt;, a french startup involved in knowledge graphs, where I wrote this &lt;A href="https://bit.ly/LED-Antidot-2012" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;white paper on Business Knowledge Graphs&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;in 2014.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, from my humble point of view, &lt;STRONG&gt;putting together&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color="#00CCFF"&gt;SAP ERP&lt;/FONT&gt; +&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color="#00CCFF"&gt;SAP Business Data Cloud&lt;/FONT&gt; + &lt;FONT color="#00CCFF"&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp;Knowledge Graphs&lt;/FONT&gt; + &lt;FONT color="#00CCFF"&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp;Business AI with Joule&lt;/FONT&gt; creates a winning combo. It puts SAP in a unique position , better than any competitor, to bring the best of AI to the customers.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAP announcements at TechEd.jpeg" style="width: 800px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347605i3BDAD036538092B6/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SAP announcements at TechEd.jpeg" alt="SAP announcements at TechEd.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And what has been presented and announced at SAP TechEd makes SAP even stronger:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-ABAP-1&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a new model allowing to handle ABAP language: trained on more than 250 million lines of ABAP code, 30 million lines of CDS code, and extensive technical documentation, it is purpose-built to&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;explain&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;generate&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-the-next-era-of-abap-development/ba-p/14260522" target="_self"&gt;modern ABAP code&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-RPT-1 (&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Relational Pre-trained Transformer Model-1&lt;/EM&gt;) is a &lt;STRONG&gt;brand new &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/what-is-sap-rpt-1-a-table-specialized-model-explained-through-the-original/ba-p/14277618" target="_self"&gt;classification and regression model&lt;/A&gt;,&lt;/STRONG&gt; allowing to &lt;STRONG&gt;better handle &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-rpt-1-a-revolutionary-tabular-ml-model-and-owasp-ml-top-10-compliance/ba-p/14270750" target="_self"&gt;structured, tabular business data&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt; It is a paradigm shift in machine learning, introducing a revolutionary approach that eliminates the security-performance trade-off entirely. SAP-RPT-1 achieves state-of-the-art performance and&amp;nbsp;already outperforms regular text-based LLMs&amp;nbsp;through semantic understanding of tabular relationships.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Knowledge Graph in SAP HANA &lt;/STRONG&gt;Cloud&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;an RDF graph built from system catalog, capturing tables, columns, relationships, and annotations. It provides&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-hana-cloud-becomes-agentic-introducing-discovery-agent-amp-data-agent/ba-p/14257394" target="_self"&gt;the semantic layer&lt;/A&gt; needed for exploration, AI grounding, and graph-based reasoning.&lt;/STRONG&gt; It&amp;nbsp;allows agents to reason about data, to understand entities relationships, and which attributes are relevant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A2A and MCP protocols &lt;/STRONG&gt;foster Agentic AI&amp;nbsp;by allowing&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/building-an-agentic-ai-system-with-agent2agent-a2a-and-mcp-tools-on-sap-btp/ba-p/14093412" target="_self"&gt;autonomous agents collaboration&lt;/A&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP is providing&amp;nbsp;out-of-the-box Joule agents and alllowing customers to create custom agents with Agent Builder in Joule Studio. Beyond that, agentic protocols such as&amp;nbsp;A2A - &lt;EM&gt;Agent to Agent&lt;/EM&gt; - and MCP - &lt;EM&gt;Model Context Protocol&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;- with SAP Lean IX &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1749118636333001o3gW" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Agent Hub&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/agent-mining-in-sap-signavio-understand-agent-behavior/ba-p/14279314" target="_self"&gt;Agent Mining&lt;/A&gt; in SAP Signavio&amp;nbsp;allow to &lt;STRONG&gt;standardize, deploy and monitor AI agents collaboration.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To dig deeper on these topics, follow the links I've put in the text above, watch the replay of the SAP TechEd sessions and also refer to&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/topics/innovation-guide/h2" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Innovation Guide&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Guide&amp;nbsp;"&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/serviceguide/what-is-joule?locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What is Joule?&lt;/A&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569919661"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What impact will AI have on human employment?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, we all agree, SAP is doing very well with Business AI for empowering companies to do better and faster. And this is very good for SAP and its entire ecosystem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But when it comes to employees working in these companies, things could be different. Indeed, some news popping up in mainstream media are a bit worrying. For instance, according to &lt;A href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/25/why-ai-wont-take-your-job-partnership-agents-robots-mckinsey/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company&lt;/A&gt;&lt;A href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/25/why-ai-wont-take-your-job-partnership-agents-robots-mckinsey/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;,&lt;/A&gt; AI can already do almost 60% of all the work:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/25/why-ai-wont-take-your-job-partnership-agents-robots-mckinsey/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Fortune McKinsey AI.jpeg" style="width: 700px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347585i0A89D332BF7783EC/image-dimensions/700x639/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="700" height="639" role="button" title="Fortune McKinsey AI.jpeg" alt="Fortune McKinsey AI.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Their research “&lt;A href="https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/agents-robots-and-us-skill-partnerships-in-the-age-of-ai" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Agents, robots, and us: Skill partnerships in the age of AI&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;” says that the future of work will be basically shaped by partnerships among people, agents, and robots - all powered by AI. The research emphasizes that capturing AI’s massive potential economic value - about $2.9 trillion by 2023 in the US only! -&amp;nbsp;depends entirely on how organizations will reorganize.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pierre_Col_1-1764761106700.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347986i1CF8ED90C196E1FB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pierre_Col_1-1764761106700.png" alt="Pierre_Col_1-1764761106700.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Indeed, be it for business users, for consultants, for developers, AI agents will be everywhere... and they will do a lot of tasks done by human employees today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And we have already seen this year how big tech firms have "reorganized" to embrace AI benefits:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Amazon -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;30,000 layoffs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accenture -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/company-just-laid-off-11-123000530.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;11,000 layoffs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Microsoft -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;6,000 layoffs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;HP - &lt;A href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/25/tech/hp-layoffs-ai-efforts" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;4,000-6000 layoffs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;So in total more than 50,000 jobs have been erased in a few months only. And SAP as well is shrinking its workforce: “I&lt;EM&gt;n one year, it could be one or sometimes two percent of jobs that are eliminated&lt;/EM&gt;” said Christian Klein, and&amp;nbsp;Dominik Asam&amp;nbsp; added “&lt;EM&gt;There are certain tasks which are automated and for the same volume of output we can afford to have less people&lt;/EM&gt;". He&amp;nbsp;admits to be "brutal",&amp;nbsp; comparing this program to routines such as brushing teeth...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile, it seems everyone is trying to reassure the public that everything will be fine… perhaps to prevent tens of millions of workers from becoming upset about the prospect of losing their jobs?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Should not a part of the value created by all the AI software and humanoid robots be used to compentiate this massive loss of jobs?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, in many countries, health insurance, unemployment insurance, and pensions are financed by contributions paid by employers and employees on human work. If the number of employees is decreasing, shouldn't social security contributions be levied on the work performed by AI agents and humanoid robots?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="workers of the world unite.jpg" style="width: 480px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347612i5102A5D408955909/image-dimensions/480x480/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="480" height="480" role="button" title="workers of the world unite.jpg" alt="workers of the world unite.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Will robots embrace &lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers_of_the_world,_unite!" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Karl Marx slogan&lt;/A&gt;? &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":upside_down_face:"&gt;🙃&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What do you think?

The issue was poor prompt design. With proper prompt engineering, the assistant could have recognized my rebate request and guided me to the correct, enabled form. A smarter workflow would have turned a dead end into a faster way to get my rebate money.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What fun!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This experience underscores a critical truth:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;EM&gt;when prompts fail to capture real&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;‑&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;world users’ intent, the customer experience collapses.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;For business and IT users working with AI, this isn’t just a consumer inconvenience, it’s a wake‑up call. Prompt engineering has become a strategic discipline the bridge between user intent and AI execution. It ensures AI systems can interpret nuance, adapt to context, and deliver meaningful results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Prompt optimization extends this discipline, helping organizations scale reliably across large language models (LLMs) and multiple AI systems so that business goals and IT execution remain aligned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Whether in customer service troubleshooting, agentic AI-driven enterprise workflows, or customer engagement, the quality of prompts directly determines the quality of the user experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;In this age of AI agents and assistants, refining prompts is no longer optional; it is essential for building trust, driving efficiency, enabling scalable automation, and achieving successful outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569951496"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reducing AI Project Failures - Understanding Prompt Engineering and Optimization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;AI projects don’t fail because the models are weak, they fail because communication breaks down. When business intent isn’t translated into clear instructions, even the most advanced systems deliver poor results. Prompt engineering and prompt optimization have emerged as the disciplines that close this gap, turning human goals into AI assistant ready guidance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Prompt engineering shapes the initial interaction, ensuring AI systems can interpret nuance and context. Prompt optimization builds on that foundation, refining prompts for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability across large language models (LLMs) and multiple AI systems. Together, they enable organizations to move beyond ad hoc experimentation toward reliable, enterprise‑grade outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Together, prompt engineering and prompt optimization form the bridge between business and IT: business teams articulate goals and context, while IT ensures technical precision and scalability. When aligned, they transform user intent into reliable AI execution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to a RAND report, 80% of AI project failures stem from poor human to AI communication. Misunderstandings between business and IT teams about goals, data, and capabilities are the most common cause of failure. Companies that master prompt engineering achieve significantly higher ROI compared to those relying on basic or ad hoc prompting (1).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In short:&lt;/STRONG&gt; success doesn’t come from the technology alone; it comes from how we communicate with it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="People.at.Conference.jpg" style="width: 402px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/348237iE8CAF4B250712171/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="People.at.Conference.jpg" alt="People.at.Conference.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373437991"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Prompt engineering, with prompt optimization as a key subset, is no longer a fringe skill. It is becoming a critical organizational capability embedded into everyday business functions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to Market Research Future (MRFR), the prompt engineering market was valued at $2.195 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow to $32.78 billion by 2035, with a staggering 27.86% CAGR (2).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1176924486"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Prompt Engineering Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Prompt optimization transforms vague queries into precise instructions, guiding AI toward accurate, consistent, and actionable outputs. With AI agents and assistants like SAP’s Joule, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, organizations recognize that prompt engineering is essential to maximize AI’s potential and align outcomes with business goals.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has embedded prompt optimization into Joule, powered by the Generative AI Hub in &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI Core&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/codejam-ai-prompt-engineering-and-orchestration/blob/main/exercises/00-prompt-engineering-with-ai-launchpad/readme.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Launchpad&lt;/A&gt; (part of the SAP Business Technology Platform) and supported by SAP’s &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-foundation-os.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI Foundation&lt;/A&gt;, delivering enterprise‑grade accuracy and trust with Large Language Models (LLMs).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At SAP Sapphire 2025, SAP announced a proprietary &lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/ai-core-genaihub-prompt-optimization..html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Prompt Optimizer&lt;/A&gt; built with the company, Not Diamond. This optimizer enables enterprises to migrate and adapt prompts across multiple LLMs, supporting consistency, accelerating adoption, and improving the user experience across diverse AI systems (3).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not Diamond envisions “a multi‑model AI future, with thousands of foundation models, millions of fine‑tuned variants, and billions &lt;SPAN&gt;of custom inference engines running on top of them&lt;/SPAN&gt;.” Their infrastructure routes, governs, and scales prompts across these systems, ensuring flexibility and trust.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This partnership confirms prompt optimization as an important, core enterprise requirement, bridging business strategy with technology capabilities for responsible AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember3883" id="toc-hId-980410981"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;From Hard‑Coded Prompts to Agentic AI Orchestration&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Currently, there is a larger shift from static prompt engineering toward dynamic, context‑aware orchestration. Agentic AI is evolving as the inevitable evolution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;In this rebate example handling with prompt engineering means hard‑coding keywords such as &lt;EM&gt;“rebate”&lt;/EM&gt; and product numbers and writing scripts to manually enable the routing to the appropriate form. It requires constant upkeep.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;In the future, agentic AI changes the flow entirely. Instead of static prompts, the agent recognizes, in the rebate example, the intent dynamically, queries the product database directly, and routes requests to backend systems without manual intervention.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Responses adapt in real time, errors trigger self-correction cycles, and product updates sync automatically with the catalog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;This rebate scenario shows the shift from today’s manual prompt engineering to tomorrow’s agentic orchestration moving from scripted rules to adaptive intelligence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-783897476"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Best of Prompt Engineering Capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Prompt optimization is the discipline that converts AI potential into measurable business outcomes, delivering benefits such as:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clarifies Intent – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Ensures AI understands user goals, reducing miscommunication and aligning outputs with business needs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customer Engagement &amp;amp; Personalization – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Crafts prompts that drive tailored chatbot interactions, outreach, and recommendations, fostering loyalty and satisfaction.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Structures Outputs – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Guides AI to deliver usable formats (tables, lists, reports, narratives) for clarity and consistency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improves Efficiency &amp;amp; Operational Automation –&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Minimizes unnecessary token usage, accelerates turnaround, and empowers agentic AI to automate repetitive workflows such as reporting, summarization, and FAQ handling.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adds Domain Context – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Embeds industry‑specific language, governance and compliance rules, approved product names, synonyms, and brand tone for relevance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supports Scalability Across Teams – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Builds reusable prompt libraries and frameworks that allow consistent enterprise‑wide adoption without reinventing workflows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Content Quality &amp;amp; Consistency – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Ensures outputs are brand‑aligned, accurate, and emotionally resonant across all channels.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Optimizes Across Models – &lt;/STRONG&gt;With tools like Not Diamond’s Prompt Optimizer, prompts can be migrated and adapted across Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, Joule, and other LLMs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced Accuracy &amp;amp; Decision‑Making – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Produces precise, consistent outputs and extracts actionable intelligence quickly to support better business decisions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;By uniting these capabilities, prompt optimization becomes the foundation for trustworthy, scalable, and business‑aligned AI success.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AdobeStock_558703749_Young.Professionals.jpeg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/348242i10BE48643376C73E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="AdobeStock_558703749_Young.Professionals.jpeg" alt="AdobeStock_558703749_Young.Professionals.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-587383971"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Short on Time? Who Manages Prompt Engineering&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The shift from prompt engineering to agentic AI isn’t just the domain of IT or developers. It is opening up a wave of business‑friendly, low‑code/no‑code opportunities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Consultants, contractors, and employees can create value by helping organizations design, deploy, and optimize AI workflows without deep computer science level programming.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Examples include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prompt Engineer&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Business‑oriented) – Designs and optimizes prompts for customer service, marketing, and enterprise workflows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agentic AI Workflow Designer&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Uses low‑code tools to connect AI agents with backend systems, automating rebate claims, reporting, and customer engagement without heavy coding.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI Solutions Consultant &lt;/STRONG&gt;– Advises companies on integrating agentic AI into existing processes, bridging IT and business teams.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No‑Code AI Developer&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Builds AI‑powered applications using drag‑and‑drop platforms and reusable prompt libraries.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI Product Owner / Business Analyst&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Guides adoption by mapping workflows, defining requirements, and ensuring AI agents align with business goals.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI Governance &amp;amp; Compliance Specialist&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Establishes rules for prompt libraries, agentic workflows, and data handling.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;In fast‑paced, short‑handed work environments, these specialists provide focus and discipline, coach key stakeholders with standard operating procedures (SOPs), monitor performance, and refine prompts as business needs evolve ensuring AI systems remain accurate, consistent, and trusted across the enterprise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-390870466"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Prompt engineering and its refinement through prompt optimization evolving into agentic AI is no longer a niche skill or technical curiosity; it has become a core business capability that drives efficiency, compliance, and innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Organizations that embrace it gain a competitive edge, while those that neglect it risk wasted investments and inconsistent results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;By embedding prompt optimization as a business standard, integrated into workflows through enterprise‑wide libraries, governance, and automated refinement, companies can optimize AI strategies to keep pace with evolving models, regulations, and customer expectations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The future of enterprise AI will not be defined by those who merely explore prompts and agentic AI, but by those who master them, transforming raw model potential into trusted, scalable business value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;And as a result, users who want to get their rebates processed can save time by getting answers versus gaps and dead ends.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-194356961"&gt;---&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;Your Comments are Appreciated!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FFFFFF"&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;Interested to hear your experiences when prompting works and doesn't work from a business and IT perspective!!!&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;If you are new to prompt engineering, what are your impressions as a result of reading this blog?&lt;BR /&gt;Please take a moment to post them below...&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Thanks!!!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--2156544"&gt;---&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;About the Author&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rich Blumberg is a long time SAP Community member and contributor.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Aviation safety became non-negotiable because stakeholders agreed on a clear definition: keeping humans alive and systems operational. For AI, the definition is less obvious and varies by use case. We define &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI safety&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; as systems operating within intended boundaries without causing harm: technical, ethical, or societal, as beautifully explained by Bettina Laugwitz in her introductory blogpost of this series (&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/artificial-intelligence-blogs-posts/keep-the-blue-side-up-building-trust-in-ai-through-transparency-responsible/ba-p/14269929" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Keep the blue side up: Building trust in AI throug... - SAP Community&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;). This means being &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;lawful, ethical, and robust&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, echoing the principles outlined in global AI governance frameworks such as ISO/IEC 42001 and related regulations such as the EU AI Act. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.iso.org/standard/42001" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ISO/IEC 42001:2023 - AI management systems&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EU Artificial Intelligence Act | Up-to-date developments and analyses of the EU AI Act&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-025-00661-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Standards, frameworks, and legislation for artificial intelligence (AI) transparency | AI and Ethics&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For “Transparency &amp;amp; Explainability” in AI systems to progress beyond aspirational slogans; they must be &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;engineered into the product, the pipeline, and day-to-day operations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, with clear roles for every stakeholder. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/data-and-policy/article/overview-of-transparency-and-inspectability-mechanisms-to-achieve-accountability-of-artificial-intelligence-systems/C9E75DB736CAAEA00158D8F0ACD595D6" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Overview of transparency and inspectability mechanisms to achieve accountability of artificial intelligence systems | Data &amp;amp; Policy | Cambridge Core&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume16No10/Paper_102-Evaluating_Transparency_in_the_Development_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Systems.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Evaluating Transparency in the Development of Artificial Intelligence Systems: A Systematic Literature Review.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;Let's look at how.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI's Captain and the crew: Stakeholder Requirement Mapping&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In aviation, roles are clearly defined: pilots, air traffic controllers, maintenance crew, and cabin staff, each have specific responsibilities and access to information. Pilots see cockpit instruments not the engineering schematics; maintenance teams get technical manuals, not passenger safety cards. This layered approach ensures clarity without unnecessary information overload. Similarly, transparency must be tailored to the different roles. Engineers need deep technical details while end users need simple actionable explanations of the system they are interacting with.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What does it include: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A persona mapping exercise should be conducted in the early ideation stage for the AI feature to identify stakeholders including engineers, product owners, compliance teams, end users, etc. and their transparency needs should be detailed out. Role-based access to information should follow the least privilege principle. Further to this mapping exercise, there should be a clear assignment of accountabilities related to transparency checkpoints(decided on a case to case basis). Questions like: who approves product updates, who updates the documentation, who monitors compliance, etc. Should be answered by the use case team and related mapping should be embedded into the design documents and backlog items early in the lifecycle.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;practice:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; An established approach to identify user roles, users’ objectives, and their (information) needs is conducting early-stage design workshops (e. g. following the SAP AppHaus’ &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://apphaus.sap.com/resource/business-ai-explore-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Business AI Explore&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; or &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://apphaus.sap.com/resource/business-ai-design-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Design workshop&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; methodology).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigating tough terrains: Classifying use cases&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For planning appropriate contingency measures, scenarios within aviation sector are classified into different categories, based on weather conditions, passenger load, aircraft readiness, etc. Similarly, it is important to classify AI use cases into different categories early on to decide the extent of transparency measures to be implemented within the use case to mitigate the associated risks appropriately.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What does it include: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This would include classification based on low, medium, high impact (on individuals for e.g.), critically of the sector in which the use case is operationalized (HR, Finance being on the higher criticality side), automation levels (fully automated decision-making being highly critical), tool access (especially for agent use cases, in order to avoid cascading harms), regulatory exposure (For e.g. healthcare being highly regulated), etc. Considering this classification, for appropriate transparency:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Human oversight mechanisms should be appropriately adjusted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Retention period for the audit logs should be proportional to the impact.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;High impact use cases should have rollback mechanisms and hence related documentation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Impact should be linked to internal responsible AI policies around transparency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In practice: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At SAP, every AI use case goes through the AI Ethics Review process that categorizes them into different categories according to the respective ethical impact. A detailed blogpost around the AI ethics governance process at SAP will be published soon as part of this blogpost series around AI transparency. For now,&amp;nbsp;to learn more about how the process works, please refer to the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/03/7211ee96-647e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP AI Ethics Handbook&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; (chapter “Principles into action”) in which categorization criteria and governance setup are described in more details (or watch the “Governing AI Ethics at SAP” lesson of the SAP Learning Journey &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/putting-ai-ethics-into-practice-at-sap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Putting AI Ethics into Practice at SAP”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI's Pre‑flight checklists: Transparency &amp;amp; explainability prerequisites&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Airplanes are never shipped without a complete ticked off checklist. Similarly, AI features should never be shipped without passing a Transparency &amp;amp; explainability checklist. This list should also be passed down the chain to relevant stakeholders who can then use this at different checkpoints and keep an eye out for deviations and document these parameters. This not only includes architectural transparency, but also other components of overall engineering side of AI development related quality checks focusing on transparency and explainability which should be provided to relevant stakeholders within the enterprise and to the system admins at the customer/user side.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What does it include: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A pre-flight checklist for AI transparency should mandate architectural transparency by documenting system purpose, data sources, model type, and limitations; confirm explainability readiness&amp;nbsp;wherever AI influences outcomes; and verify compliance hooks aligned with regulatory anchors like the EU AI Act. This checklist must integrate into the development workflow by linking items to backlog tools and making transparency a release gate item. No feature ships without proof of appropriate transparency and explainability. It should also be distributed across stakeholders including architects, QA, product owners, and system admins, with checkpoints for deviations during lifecycle changes (something on the lines of &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/design-system/fiori-design-web/v1-136/discover/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Design System Guidelines&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;). Alongside this, evidence packs should be stored in a central repository linked to project management tools for auditability. Finally, for high-risk AI systems, add enhanced monitoring and troubleshooting documentation for deployment and operations to ensure resilience and compliance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In practic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;e:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Transparency and explainability requirements are very different for different application contexts, situations and user personas (as explained in this blogpost: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/artificial-intelligence-blogs-posts/trustworthy-ai-how-to-make-artificial-intelligence-understandable/ba-p/13576857" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Trustworthy AI: How to make artificial intelligenc... - SAP Community&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;). The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/design-system/fiori-design-web/v1-120/foundations/ai-and-joule-design/guidelines/explainable-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fiori Design Guidelines for explainable AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; take this variety of expectations into account by differentiating between L1/L2/L3 explanations: Level 1: Minimum explanation level for quick overview; Level 2: Condensed view of the relevant properties, amounts and contextual information; Level 3: Extended report specifically for advanced users covering details around the AI performance, further context and conditions for monitoring AI operations). Applied to an SAP use case, the need for end-user transparency is very obvious when it comes to HR related contexts, e. g. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_Fieldglass/d90e4d56084b4540b73e72fc822b8fc9/312e889200ba4abb82a3a64a530595e4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;candidate analysis in recruiting&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

By embedding stakeholder mapping, risk classification, and compliance gates early, we create a foundation where trust is engineered, not promised. These steps ensure that transparency is not an afterthought but a design principle that shapes every decision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the next blog post, we’ll move beyond planning and delve deeper into practice, exploring how transparency can be operationalized during realization, productization, and operations stages, with concrete engineering patterns. Together, these two parts outline key engineering practices for integrating transparency into AI systems aligned with the principles of lawfulness, ethics, and robustness.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-right" image-alt="abhishek_pant01_0-1764838167771.png" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/348424i5F7FE3DCB12CEB35/image-size/small/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="abhishek_pant01_0-1764838167771.png" alt="abhishek_pant01_0-1764838167771.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's keep sharing how &lt;STRONG&gt;AI transparency&lt;/STRONG&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At SAP, we are committed to embedding AI capabilities directly into our core applications and processes with &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Business AI,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; designed to deliver tangible, real-world business outcomes across the enterprise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigating this dynamic landscape is key: understanding what’s coming next, when features or agents are available, and how they could improve end-to-end business processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;That’s why we are thrilled to announce a new and dedicated roadmap experience for &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/business-views/A39622A5AFE542D1A81FC4B6DF4DABDC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Business AI on the SAP Roadmap Explorer website&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;

Moment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;I recently started building a code generation tool using Large Language Models (LLMs) via API calls. Like many of you, I learned the golden rule of LLM development early on: &lt;STRONG&gt;LLMs are stateless.&lt;/STRONG&gt; They don’t "remember" past requests; every API call is a fresh start.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;But as I tested my tool, I noticed something that confused me.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Whenever I made changes in my prompt instructions:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The output was perfect!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;When I changed &lt;EM&gt;nothing&lt;/EM&gt; and sent the exact same request:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The output still changed!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;I expected that if the inputs were identical (and the model is stateless), the result should be consistent. This inconsistency led me down a rabbit hole of research where I landed on a feature that completely changed how I optimize my workflows: &lt;STRONG&gt;Prompt Caching.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;If you are building AI Agents or Code Gen tools on SAP BTP (using SAP Generative AI Hub) or directly via provider APIs, this is a mechanism you need to understand—not just for speed, but to clear up the "caching" misconception.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Myth Buster: "Prompt Cache" NE "Response Cache"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Here is the inference I made during my research, which might clear up your confusion too:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Reality:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Prompt Caching does not cache the answer.&lt;/STRONG&gt; It caches the &lt;STRONG&gt;question.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;When we hear "Cache" in software development (like SAP ABAP or SAP HANA), we think of storing the &lt;EM&gt;result&lt;/EM&gt; to serve it instantly next time. &lt;STRONG&gt;Prompt Caching is different.&lt;/STRONG&gt; It caches the &lt;STRONG&gt;pre-computation of your input context&lt;/STRONG&gt; (the Key-Value states of the attention mechanism). It essentially "pre-loads" the model's brain with your long documents, codebases, or instructions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;However, the &lt;STRONG&gt;generation&lt;/STRONG&gt; of the response is still calculated fresh, token by token. This brings us to the second major realization—why your output changes even when the prompt doesn't.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "Temperature=0" Trap: Why It’s Still Not Deterministic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;You might think, &lt;EM&gt;"If the prompt is cached and I set Temperature to 0, shouldn't the output be identical every time?"&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;The short answer: No.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;The technical answer: Modern LLMs are only "mostly" deterministic, even at Temperature=0.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;While setting the temperature to 0 forces &lt;STRONG&gt;greedy decoding&lt;/STRONG&gt; (always picking the highest-probability next token), real-world infrastructure introduces subtle variations:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Models like GPT-4 are believed to use a "Sparse MoE" design. Different "expert" subnetworks handle different parts of your input. Parallel routing and slight gating differences can introduce non-determinism in the path your data takes.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;GPU "Fuzziness":&lt;/STRONG&gt; Modern GPUs perform massive parallel operations. Because floating-point arithmetic is non-associative, the order of operations can shift slightly based on thread scheduling. A microscopic rounding error can flip a token choice when two words have nearly identical probabilities.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System Variance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Your request might hit a different backend instance or hardware generation (indicated by the system_fingerprint in OpenAI responses).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Takeaway:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Even with a cached prompt and zero temperature, expect minor "drift" in your outputs. The prompt cache speeds up the &lt;EM&gt;input&lt;/EM&gt; processing, but the &lt;EM&gt;output&lt;/EM&gt; generation remains subject to the complex physics of AI hardware.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How It Works: Implicit vs. Explicit&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Different vendors handle this differently. If you are using models via SAP Generative AI Hub, it's crucial to know how the underlying models behave.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Implicit Caching (The "It Just Works" Approach)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Vendors:&lt;/STRONG&gt; OpenAI (GPT-4.1), Google (Gemini)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mechanism:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You don't need to change your code. If the API detects that the first 1,024+ tokens of your prompt match a previous request sent recently, it automatically uses the cached processing.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pros:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Zero developer effort.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cons:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Less control over what stays in the cache.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="4"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Explicit Caching (The "Precision" Approach)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Vendor:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Anthropic (Claude 3.5 and &amp;gt; Sonnet/Haiku)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mechanism:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You must explicitly tell the API where to stop caching. You insert a cache_control parameter at a specific "checkpoint" in your message history.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pros:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You guarantee that your heavy context (like a full ABAP codebase or API specification) is cached.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cons:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Requires a small code change.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Common Practice for Agentic AI &amp;amp; Code Gen&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;In my code generation use case, I send the entire project context (libraries, style guides, and current code) with every request. Without caching, this is slow and expensive.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;The Strategy:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Organize your prompt so the static content is at the top.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System Prompt&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Static: "You are an ABAP Expert...")&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Context/Documentation&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Static: "Here is the SAP Cloud SDK documentation...") -&amp;gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;[CACHE CHECKPOINT]&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User Query&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Dynamic: "Write a method to fetch Business Partners.")&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;By placing the checkpoint after the documentation, the model "reads" the docs once. For every subsequent user query, it skips the heavy lifting and jumps straight to generating code.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Verifying the Speed Up: Analyze Your Logs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;How do you know it's working? You won't see "same output," but you will see "faster time-to-first-token."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;Look at the usage metadata in your API response.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OpenAI:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Look for cached_tokens in the usage object.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Anthropic:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Look for cache_read_input_tokens.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Google Gemini:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Look for cachedContentTokenCount.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example Analysis:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Request 1 (Cold):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Input Tokens: 10,000 | Processing Time: 4.5s&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Request 2 (Warm):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Input Tokens: 10,000 (9,900 Cached!) | Processing Time: &lt;STRONG&gt;0.8s&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why could this be a game-changer?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Latency:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The model doesn't have to "read" your 5,000-line code file every time. It "remembers" the reading process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost:&lt;/STRONG&gt; You pay significantly less (often ~90% less) for the cached tokens.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;If you see the processing time drop drastically while the output remains high-quality (and slightly varied), you have successfully implemented Prompt Caching.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;My Personal Inference: The "Bad Roll" &amp;amp; The Butterfly Effect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;During my testing, I encountered a frustrating scenario that I believe many developers will face.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Scenario:&lt;/STRONG&gt; I used OpenAI for code generation. When the prompt was cached (no changes), the code quality was consistently "not perfect"—it had minor bugs or incomplete logic.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Fix:&lt;/STRONG&gt; When I added just &lt;STRONG&gt;one single word&lt;/STRONG&gt; to the prompt, the code generation suddenly became perfect.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Contrast:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Switching to Anthropic (without caching) gave me complete code every time.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why did adding one word fix the OpenAI output?&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is what I call the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Deterministic Trap."&lt;/STRONG&gt; When you use a cached prompt with a low temperature (which we usually do for code), the model is mathematically locked into a specific "reasoning path." If the model generates a suboptimal solution (a "bad roll") on the first try, the cached state ensures it starts from the &lt;EM&gt;exact same mathematical position&lt;/EM&gt; next time. It essentially "remembers" the path to the bad answer.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;By adding a single word, I forced a &lt;STRONG&gt;"Cache Miss"&lt;/STRONG&gt; (or at least a perturbation in the attention mechanism). This acted like the "Butterfly Effect"—it shifted the token probabilities just enough to force the model to calculate a fresh path, allowing it to escape the "bad roll" and find the correct solution.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Lesson:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Prompt Caching is powerful for speed, but if you notice your model is "stuck" giving you the same bad code repeatedly, don't just retry. &lt;STRONG&gt;Change the prompt.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Even a single extra adjective can shake the model out of a local minimum and produce the perfect result.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;LLMs are stateless, but Prompt Caching gives them a "short-term memory" for processing inputs. While it won't force your outputs to be bit-for-bit identical (due to MoE and GPU nuances), it &lt;STRONG&gt;will&lt;/STRONG&gt; make your applications significantly faster and cheaper to run.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Next Step:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Check your current API logs. If you are sending long contexts (&amp;gt;1024 tokens) repeatedly, you might already be benefiting from implicit caching, or you may need to add cache_control headers for Anthropic models to unlock these savings.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;References &amp;amp; Further Reading&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Anthropic Prompt Caching:&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;A href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OpenAI Prompt Caching:&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;A href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Google Gemini Context Caching:&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;A href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/caching&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Generative AI Hub:&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;A href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/generative-ai-hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/generative-ai-hub&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi All,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I am writing this blog which have the steps to enable the Joule Communication Scenario on your SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud instance and integrate Joule Web Client plugin in your SAP Fiori Launchpad, allowing your users to interact with Joule.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below are the steps that are needed to achieve this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enable Joule Services, Cloud Identity Services (Connectivity) &amp;amp; SAP Build Work Zone , Standard Edition in a subaccount .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Establish Trust of Subaccount with the Identity Authentication tenant (IAS)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure Trusted Domain in SAP BTP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enable Fiori launchpad login using your Identity Authentication tenant&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure Trusted Domains in Identity Authentication&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Expose SAP Fiori Launchpad Content to SAP BTP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Set Up SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition as a Content Provider&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Activating SAP Build Work Zone , SAP Joule &amp;amp; Cloud identity services in subaccount&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Run the Joule Booster&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure Destinations in BTP&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure Identity Provisioning Service&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure and Activate Joule Plug-In in a Target Mapping&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note-1&lt;/STRONG&gt; : Your Cloud Identity Tenant and you BTP subaccount should be in same region&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note-2&lt;/STRONG&gt; : In this blog we are using our corporate IDP to login to our BTP , IAS and Fiori.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note-3 :&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Enablement of Joule is also available with&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cloud Integration Automation service in which several steps are automated you can refer to below blog if you want to perform this automatically&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The utilities industry will continue to play a key role in SAP’s strategy and product development. It is therefore important for us to keep customers, partners, and the entire SAP Utilities ecosystem informed about our planned innovations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As in previous years, we have created a matrix outlining the relevant industry topics and their corresponding innovations. This matrix represents a selection of the most important innovations and does not claim to be exhaustive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additional innovations may be added over time, and delivery timelines remain subject to change. Following a high-level overview of the highlights, we provide detailed information for each topic. For nearly all innovations, a &lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?INDUSTRY=UTILITY&amp;amp;range=CURRENT-LAST#Q4%202025" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;link&lt;/A&gt; to the SAP

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Suite offers &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/integration-blog-posts/api-anomaly-detection-in-sap-integration-suite/ba-p/13726636" target="_blank"&gt;API Anomaly Detection&lt;/A&gt; that involves monitoring and identifying abnormalities in time series data related to APIs, enabling API Owners detect unexpected patterns or deviations from the norm, ensuring optimal performance and business continuity. Traditionally, resolving these anomalies has been time-consuming involving manual activities around impact assessment, root cause analysis &amp;amp; identification of mitigation plans. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That’s about to change!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s New&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Suite now brings AI-powered anomaly insights and intelligent recommendations to help you move from detection to resolution faster than ever. It improves troubleshooting efficiency and reduces manual investigation time. This feature leverages advanced machine learning models to identify anomalies and AI models to suggest actionable steps to fix them—empowering API Owners &amp;amp; developers to stay ahead of issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note : The feature is in the process of getting updated in our global Data centres. Check&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3463620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;Note for information about regional availability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note : The availability of the Anomaly Detection &amp;amp; Intelligent Recommendations feature is dependent on your SAP Integration Suite service plan. Check&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2903776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;note for information about the various plans and supported features.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Benefits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Detailed Insights &amp;amp; Causes: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Ready to use analysis of the Anomaly, its impact and the probable root cause(s)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Intelligent Recommendations:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Get context-aware suggestions for quick resolution&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reduced Downtime:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Minimize business impact with faster troubleshooting&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Continuous Learning:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Recommendations improve over time as the system learns from user feedback&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Feature Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To assist API Owners who have enabled Anomaly Detection in their tenants with faster resolution of Anomalies, we introduce AI-driven analysis of the Anomalies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When an Anomaly is detected, an advanced AI-model generates comprehensive insights on the event around the system state, clients involved, the intensity of the Anomaly etc. &amp;nbsp;It also then highlights the potential root causes for the Anomaly, which gives clarity on where the corrections/resolutions must be applied. Finally, it also provides a set of recommendations that the API Owners &amp;amp; developers can apply – both within &amp;amp; outside APIM systems - to resolve the issue at hand &amp;amp; also prevent future events.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Enablement&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As an API Administrator of an SAP Integration Suite – API Management tenant, one could enable this new extension by just selecting an additional check box under Anomaly Detection settings. If you are switching on Anomaly Detection for the first time, then the check box is selected by default. You need to accept the Generative AI usage terms before starting to use the feature.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 171536.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349729i73E2EDB5B43970D2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-12-08 171536.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 171536.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Anomaly Analysis&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the event of an Anomaly, if the Intelligent Recommendations has been enabled on the tenant, you will see three new tabs under the Anomaly details – Insights, Causes &amp;amp; Recommendations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Insights&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Delivers an in-depth analysis of unusual API traffic patterns, the system state during the anomaly, and its potential impact on API performance and stability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Causes&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Highlights the likely factors behind the anomaly by examining API usage trends, traffic variations, and underlying system conditions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Recommendations&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Offers practical steps and configuration adjustments to resolve the issue, enhance API performance, and implement preventive measures to avoid similar anomalies in the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the example below, an API Traffic surge Anomaly has been detected. Observe how each of the tabs helps in getting clarity on the event itself &amp;amp; also quickly identify what could be done next.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For each of the generated content, feedback could be provided that helps the AI model learn over time &amp;amp; improve accuracy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 172235.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349733iDF7BA78F631AFA38/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-12-08 172235.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 172235.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 172431.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349734i812BEF1DC06332AA/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-12-08 172431.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 172431.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 172407.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349735i6D11067F983A10D6/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-12-08 172407.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 172407.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of spending hours diagnosing issues, API owners can now rely on AI-driven guidance to resolve problems efficiently. This means less manual effort, fewer disruptions, and more time for innovation.

However if we look at the sample sizes this differences probably are not statistically significant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Chart_12_Industry_Skills_Comparison.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/349826i44576614606D05CB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Chart_12_Industry_Skills_Comparison.png" alt="Chart_12_Industry_Skills_Comparison.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-194445279"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;KEY FINDINGS of the SAP AI Skills-Self Assessment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-127014493"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. The Implementation Challenge&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2-point gaps between motivation and implementation create several risks: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;failed pilot projects&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;shadow AI implementations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; bypassing governance, and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;competitive disadvantage&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; from delayed adoption.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--144730381"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. The Awareness Trap&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Joule has strong awareness (3.77) - probably from the strong marketing boosts. But 38% have &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;never heard&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; of ML Services on BTP (2.38 awareness). We know that you can't implement what you don't know.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--341243886"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3. The Governance thread&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Responsible AI shows the second-smallest gap (1.69 points), but the absolute scores are concerning. Implementation averaging 2.43 means most organizations are deploying AI without robust ethical frameworks, data governance, or regulatory compliance measures. With AI regulations tightening globally (EU AI Act, various data protection laws), this is a compliance time bomb.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--537757391"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4. The S/4HANA focus&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With 70.8% of respondents focused on S/4HANA, the AI skills gaps impact the success of organizations' most critical ERP transformations. S/4HANA's embedded AI capabilities and Joule integration aren't "nice-to-have" features—they're core value propositions. Missing these capabilities means organizations are upgrading infrastructure while leaving innovation value on the table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--440867889"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;CRITICAL ANALYSIS&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These results suggest the SAP ecosystem is approaching a &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;skills challenge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;in Business AI. Here's why:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Talent scarcity&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Only 6-17% can implement AI solutions (at least of the people who took the assessment)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The cost of delay&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: While teams are "motivated" (4.0+), competitors with implementation skills may already deploying and iterating.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Skills Cluster Together:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;8 strong correlations were found between AI capabilities. The strongest was between ML Services ↔ Joule Studio (somehow common-sense that technical skills go together). So you could build cross-capability curricula.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;False comfort&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Awareness does not equal readiness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ungoverned experimentation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: High motivation (4.12) + low governance &amp;amp; implementation skills (2.43) means that teams might rush to "do AI" without frameworks like for responsible AI or general implementation frameworks like SAP Activate..&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Organization Size is Irrelevant&lt;/STRONG&gt;: There is no correlation (ρ = -0.04, p = 0.74) between company size and capability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The "&lt;STRONG&gt;Dangerous Enthusiasm&lt;/STRONG&gt;" Cohort: 12.4% are highly motivated but lack fundamental knowledge. This implies the risk of ungoverned deployments thus failed pilots which can lead to AI resistance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I also did some deep statistical analysis (ANOVA, Regression and Correlation tests) and the key implications and call to action by Claudes 4.5 deep research is something I could not formulate better.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;"Replace awareness metrics with deployment capability. Use outcome based criteria like&amp;nbsp;productive deployment, not exam scores. T&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;HE ONE ACTION: Stop measuring readiness by surveys. Promote and measure actual deployment capability. "&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--637381394"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;CALL TO ACTION: CLOSE THE AI SKILLS GAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1127297906"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What does that implicate for individuals? I suggest a&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3-Step Action Plan:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Assess yourself honestly&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Take the self-assessment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Prioritize your own learning path by topic &amp;amp; role&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Architects/Consultants --&amp;gt; Joule + Embedded AI + Responsible AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Developers --&amp;gt; ML Services on BTP + Joule Studio + the Certification&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Project Managers --&amp;gt; Governance + awareness across all areas&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;IT Managers --&amp;gt; Strategic awareness + investment decisions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Build implementation skills:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Motivation + knowledge without practice is good but not sufficient.

Motivation is high—higher than awareness in most cases —indicating AI's strategic importance. But the implementation skills lag dangerously behind. One explanation could be, that individuals are highly motivated, but the organizational speed of AI implementation lacks behind. Obviously using AI Tools for improving individual productivity is faster and simpler than re-engineering processes or embedding AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;individuals&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, this gap represents career opportunity - they can build implementation skills now while the market is undersupplied.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;companies&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, this gap represents a risk: competitors who close the gap faster will capture AI's competitive advantages while you're still "motivated to learn more."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP ecosystem&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; broadly, this gap represents an urgent enablement challenge. We can't realize the promise of SAP's Business AI investments if the professionals who must implement them lack the skills to do so.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;But there is actually&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;good news.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;People are highly motivated to use SAP Business AI and its components. To foster motivation is always one of the most difficult parts in digital adoption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Knowledge and skill gaps can be closed. Awareness can be built.

The joint study by SAP Business Consulting and Kühne Logistics University clearly shows that companies who tightly integrate their processes digitally can prevent bottlenecks, reduce costs, and increase service levels. At the same time, however, the survey also makes it clear that the ambitions of many companies in the field of transport and warehouse logistics for 2035 are surprising – less because the technologies are lacking, but because their implementation is difficult alongside current operational challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Global competitive pressure is increasing, and the pressure to act in terms of efficiency and cost optimization remains high. Energy, transport and staff are becoming more expensive, growth stimuli in the industrial sector are scarce in many developed countries, and efficiency is no longer achieved incidentally. Even small improvements in lead times, utilization, or error rates have an immediate impact on delivery dates and costs. In manufacturing companies, logistics is the backbone of stable processes, and standstill is therefore not an option. At the same time, the shortage of skilled workers often exacerbates the pressure to act: In Germany and other countries, jobs in warehouses and transport are increasingly difficult to fill, especially where processes are still lived manually and fragmented.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tasks must be solved differently in the future – through higher automation, targeted assistance systems, the use of AI, and the courageous rethinking of processes. Against the backdrop of increased pressure to act, the results of a survey conducted in April 2025 show a mixed picture: 39 percent of respondents expect significantly stronger digitalization and data-driven warehouse processes with significant advances in responsiveness and transparency by 2035. 28 percent expect the use of advanced technologies such as autonomous vehicles or drones in transport and material flow scenarios; another 28 percent see AI agents as integral support tools for dispatchers, warehouse managers and drivers. In addition, 20 percent expect connected ecosystems with real-time data exchange across company boundaries. So, the direction is clear, but expectations seem moderate compared to the technological perspectives and already existing use cases. One of the possible reasons: the vision exists, but there is often a lack of clear implementation plans, as time, know-how and resources are scarce. Many companies are lagging behind with the modernization of their processes and systems and can therefore integrate the potential of innovative technologies and real-time data into their daily work and decision-making to the required extent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the same time, the survey reveals weaknesses in the current situation: Only 17 percent of the 180 surveyed companies use real-time data comprehensively to optimize warehousing. Only 9 percent are committed to real-time transparency in the transportation sector with accurate arrival time forecasts, and only 6 percent have established collaborative planning and execution models with partners. It is positive to mention that 19% of companies have already gained initial experience with generative AI – so this is a new field where progress has been made. Overall, however, the figures show that the comprehensive implementation of digital innovations in practice still falls significantly short of the possibilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What needs to be done? Successful innovation requires a clear, prioritized strategy and readiness to adapt processes and technologies, supported by comprehensive and high-quality data, intelligent analytics, and effective orchestration. On the one hand, a resilient digital backbone which integrates process and sensor data into a consistent situational picture across transport, yard and warehouse is required. Orchestration within the company as well as data exchange across company boundaries is crucial. This data forms the basis for AI-driven decision logic, such as predictive ETA forecasts, dynamic capacity and slot controls, and anomaly detection. AI agents should perform routine tasks, structure exceptions, and provide appropriate options for action. In addition, AI technologies are increasingly moving into physical logistics processes, where many experts expect further groundbreaking developments – both in the software and hardware sectors. This includes increasingly flexible robots and cobots paired with innovative business models (e.g., renting robots to flexibly absorb seasonal peaks). Fast integration and the ability to up- and downscale these solutions within existing systems are crucial.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To achieve the transition to innovative technologies and processes, it is essential to proactively address cultural resistance and implement effective change management. To drive innovation at every level of the business, leaders must deliver a holistic vision and actively involve employees in the change process. An open communication culture and continuous training of employees help to create a positive environment in which technological innovations are accepted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why do ambitions remain subdued? Many companies are running multiple transformation projects at the same time. Logistics is still often seen as a pure cost center and shifts backwards in priority – although it often delivers quick and measurable effects. The first step to systematically unlocking this potential can be, for example, to develop an innovation roadmap, depending on the business context. This identifies clear areas of action and bottlenecks and links business goals with the appropriate technology choice: not only “Which robot?”, but “What problem, which flow, which bottleneck – and which measure scales across locations?".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our appeal: start now rather than catch up too late. The technologies are up and running, there is a need for action, and market pressure is increasing. Understanding the implementation as a continuous process with a clear roadmap, iterative scaling, and measurable effects closes the gap between ambition and reality – and transforms logistics from an often more reactive element of the value chain into a strategic advantage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="sebastianguetle_2-1765271141464.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/350083iD961493E6C77858B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sebastianguetle_2-1765271141464.png" alt="sebastianguetle_2-1765271141464.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure: Vision 2035 and Reality 2025 in Transportation and Logistics&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This article was written in collaboration with Prof. Kai Hoberg (Kühne Logistics University) in the context of the SAP-KLU study "The Supply Chain of the Future”.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <title>Semantic search in CAP (Node.js): vector embeddings and cosine similarity</title>
    <updated>2025-12-09T14:47:21.547000+01:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;In this blog post I report on my recent experiments and findings on how to implement a semantic search in &lt;A href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CAP&lt;/A&gt; Node.js. The goal for the search mechanism was to be able to find the item in an entity with the best semantic match based on a user query (prompt). This can be achieved using (local) vector embeddings and a cosine similarity search. I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to handle vector embeddings locally without the need for an actual (vector) database (at least when not considering scaling).&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While watching the Devtoberfest 2025 session on &lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvSrbsiIfmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Agentic Coding with CAP&lt;/A&gt; by &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/202584" target="_blank"&gt;David Kunz&lt;/A&gt;, I was intrigued to inspect the source code of the &lt;A href="https://github.com/cap-js/mcp-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CAP mcp-server&lt;/A&gt; that was talked about. Turns out, the &lt;CODE&gt;search_docs&lt;/CODE&gt; tool of the server is implemented using vector embeddings and a cosine similarity search. This sparked my interest to explore this topic further and see how the concept can be applied to other scenarios as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To start off, I will give you my understanding of vector embeddings (which might not be scientifically accurate, but is sufficient for applying the concept): Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data. Each vector has a lot of dimensions and a numerical value for each of the dimensions. The number of dimensions depends on the embedding model used. Data that has similar meaning, let's say "banana" and "apple", will also be closer to each other in the dimensional space than "banana" and "computer". It is important to note that you can only compare vectors that were created using the same embedding model, as a comparison requires the same number of dimensions with the same meaning. To create vector embeddings in a (CAP) Node.js application, this is all we need:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;import { pipeline } from "@xenova/transformers"
const embedder = await pipeline("feature-extraction", "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

const data = [
    {
        text: "banana"
    },
    {
        text: "apple"
    }
]

const createEmbeddings = async () =&amp;gt; {
    for (const item of data) {
        const embedding = await embedder(item.text, { pooling: "mean", normalize: true })
        item.embedding = JSON.stringify(Array.from(embedding.data))
    }
    return data
}

console.log(await createEmbeddings()) // [{ text: 'banana', embedding: '[-0.057455405592918396,0.03617725893855095 ...&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Going back to the original quest of implementing a semantic search, the next step is to compare the vector embedding of a user query with the vector embeddings of the existing items. For that, we use a cosine similarity search. The cosine similarity is a measure that calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. The result is a value between -1 and 1, where 1 means the vectors are identical, 0 means there is no similarity, and -1 means they are completely opposite. The principle here is that vectors that have a smaller angle between them (are closer to each other) are more similar in meaning. This concept is fundamental to how large-language models work. To calculate the cosine similarity between two vectors, we can use the following code:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;// see code sample above for creating embeddings

import cosineSimilarity from "cosine-similarity"

const search = "computer"
const searchEmbedding = await embedder(search, { pooling: "mean", normalize: true })
const results = data.map(item =&amp;gt; ({
    text: item.text,
    similarity: cosineSimilarity(Array.from(searchEmbedding.data), JSON.parse(item.embedding)).toFixed(4)
}))
console.log(results) // [ { text: 'banana', similarity: '0.4076' }, { text: 'apple', similarity: '0.5369' } ]&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosine-similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;cosine-similarity&lt;/A&gt; module essentially does all the heavy lifting for us. After creating the embedding for the search ("computer"), we compare it with each of the existing embeddings to get a similarity score. The higher the score, the similar the data is in meaning. As we can the in the logged result, "computer" is more similar to "apple" (0.5369) than to "banana" (0.4076) - for obvious reasons.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The next step is to integrate this search mechanism into a CAP application. I create a simple CAP service with a &lt;CODE&gt;Products&lt;/CODE&gt; entity, that also exposed a &lt;CODE&gt;semanticSearch&lt;/CODE&gt; function. In the handler for that function, we create the same logic as shown in the code sample above. The only difference is that we now fetch the existing items from the database (embeddings stored a string) and return the items sorted by their similarity to the search term. It is important to note that we create the embeddings not in the actual search handler, but during the initialization of the service - for obvious performance reasons.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;import { pipeline } from "@xenova/transformers"
import cosineSimilarity from "cosine-similarity"

export default async function catalog() {
    const products = this.entities["Products"]
    const data = await SELECT.from(products)
    const embedder = await pipeline("feature-extraction", "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    for (const item of data) {
        const embedding = await embedder(item.text, { pooling: "mean", normalize: true })
        await UPDATE(products, item.ID).with({ embedding: embedding.data })
    }

    this.on("semanticSearch", async (req) =&amp;gt; {
        const { search } = req.data
        const data = await SELECT.from(products)
        let results
        const searchEmbedding = await embedder(search, { pooling: "mean", normalize: true })
        results = data.map(item =&amp;gt; ({
            ...item,
            similarity: cosineSimilarity(Array.from(searchEmbedding.data), JSON.parse(item.embedding))
        }))
        results.sort((a, b) =&amp;gt; b.similarity - a.similarity)
        for (const result of results) {
            delete result.embedding
        }
        return results
    })
}&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please note that this sample won't scale for large datasets, as we are loading all items into memory for the search. Also, we are storing the embeddings in the database as strings, which is not ideal. For larger datasets, a vector database like SAP HANA Cloud would be more appropriate. However, for smaller applications or testing/learning purposes, this approach should work fine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can now test this semantic search by calling &lt;CODE&gt;&lt;A href="http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/catalog/semanticSearch(search='computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/catalog/semanticSearch(search='computer&lt;/A&gt;')&lt;/CODE&gt;, which returns the following data:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;{
    "@odata.context": "$metadata#Products",
        "value": [
            {
                "ID": 1,
                "text": "apple",
                "similarity": 0.5369198543970098
            },
            {
                "ID": 2,
                "text": "banana",
                "similarity": 0.40761179144643095
            }
        ]
}&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now let's the if customers would find the banane if they searched for &lt;CODE&gt;/semanticSearch(search='yellow fruit with curved shape')&lt;/CODE&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;CODE&gt;{
    "@odata.context": "$metadata#Products",
        "value": [
            {
                "ID": 2,
                "text": "banana",
                "similarity": 0.40374334839388043
            },
            {
                "ID": 1,
                "text": "apple",
                "similarity": 0.2445011304736103
            }
        ]
}&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;P&gt;And that's how we can implement a true semantic search in a CAP Node.js application! I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to create and handle vector embeddings locally without the need for an actual vector database (at least for smaller datasets). Also, we didn't need to rely on any external APIs to large-language models or the like, the embedding model runs completely locally.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope you like this and maybe learned something new - I certainly did.&lt;/P&gt;</content>
