    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-947607261"&gt;Summary&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;A really full month with lots to consider. Overall what I get from these reports is that the procurement and supply chain landscape for 2025 is characterized by significant shifts driven by geopolitical instability and technological advancements. Companies are moving away from traditional lowest-cost, fastest-delivery models towards more resilient supply chains&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Themes that I found from these reports were&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cost reduction was the top priority for CPOs, followed closely by third-party risk management and speed of execution&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Artificial intelligence adoption is surging, with 94% of procurement functions using generative AI weekly, and 70% open to implementing it across the value chain&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supplier relationship management (SRM) is gaining importance, with 46% of organizations reporting over 4% annual financial benefits from their SRM programs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Challenges persist in spend analysis, with 53% of organizations reporting lower-than-expected ROI from analytics solutions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These trends highlight the need for procurement leaders to adapt to a rapidly changing global landscape while leveraging new technologies to drive value and efficiency&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-751093756"&gt;BCG – Geopolitics and Global Sourcing&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GordonDonovan_0-1733468239062.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/199011i8FBBA6FD83EF14F4/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GordonDonovan_0-1733468239062.png" alt="GordonDonovan_0-1733468239062.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Last month I reviewed Gartner megatrends for procurement, and one of them was about the changing nature of global relationships. This article from &lt;A href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/geopolitics-changes-the-global-sourcing-equation" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;BC&lt;/A&gt;G takes this further and looks how Geopolitics changes the procurement equation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The article begins by recognising that for much of the past couple of decades, procurement has focussed on building procurement networks that focus on lowest cost with speediest deliveries, byt with the instability at geopolitical level this traditional approach which requires stability will no longer work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, companies must navigate an immensely more complex global landscape, one often unsettled by armed conflict, trade wars, sanctions, export controls, and other unexpected developments driven by geopolitics. As a result, companies are confronting a balancing act: how to reduce procurement costs at a time of high inflation, while at the same time improving access to key markets and ensuring that their supply chains are resilient in the face of geopolitical risk.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The article goes to describe ways to develop best value sourcing locations, (see image) including&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Costs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Delivery&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sustainability&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Risk&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Quality&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Innovation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;And then cross referencing these with differing regions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Producing a geopolitical heat risk map for the regions and products is also identified and as indicated by the economist study, scenario planning, for these key risks to identify signposts and trigger points.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All in in all a very interesting read, if you are thinking of re designing your supply chain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-554580251"&gt;Procurement Leaders – Strategic Planning Primer&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This &lt;A href="https://procurementleaders.com/content/strategic-planning-primer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt; gives us a view of what leading CPOS are thinking about for 2025.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Once again Cost savings is predicted to be the top priority for 2025, followed by third party risk and a new one, Speed of execution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;These will be enabled by evolution in operating models around business partnering, Category Management and Data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;30% identified risk management as a value driver for procurement with business interruptions, single sourced materials and at risk revenue being top areas of concern&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Speed of execution is a new entrant with supplier onboarding and sourcing cycle times being areas of measurement for improvement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-358066746"&gt;Procurement Leaders – CPO Compass 2025&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This &lt;A href="https://marketplace.procurementleaders.com/partners/ivalua/resources/cpo-compass-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt; is based on interviews with 8 experts across a range of fields (ie not just procurement) looking at the macro trends to identify some of the tensions that procurement leaders will need ot navigate to deliver value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigating the business Supercycle – The retreat from globalisation continues to redraw the world map, with procurement teams at the forefront of companies’ efforts to adjust. But as leaders continue to pivot at pace, they must develop their understanding of the wider forces driving this trend&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Balancing human and artificial intelligence - CPOs have considered talent to be the number one enabler of success for their functions. But with advances in AI potentially signalling a revolution in what work is done – and how it is accomplished – leaders must view capability development through the prism of technology&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Powering next level productivity - The imperative to do more, to do it faster and more efficiently has never been greater.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s a really great read with lots of insights and thought provokers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-161553241"&gt;Procurement Impact Report – Vertice&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This &lt;A href="https://cips-download.cips.org/expert-reports/the-procurement-impact-report?utm_campaign=2024.CIPS+Download+%7C+06%2F11%2F24+%28member+%2B+non+member%29+&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Wavecast" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/A&gt; of 300 global procurement leaders in the US and UK sought to understand the differing levels of maturity in procurement and how that translates to value and opportunity for their organisations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not surprisingly the more mature functions are were able to innovate faster, maintain compliance easier and control budgets better. This is aligned to introduction of procurement automation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What was interesting is that partially advanced procurement teams were more of a hinderance than a help, suggesting that the journey to maturity is a rocky one for the business to endure. Ion other words, change management is hard!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There was a clear split that procurement functions in the UK were more advanced in terms of maturity than their counterparts in the US. 67% of UK firms v 44% of US firms have reached advanced procurement maturity according to the report.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Worryingly, 37% of respondents say that procurement is not seen as a strategic priority and 35% say their organization is not willing to invest in the skills to tackle the issue.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Its an interesting report, with a link for a self-assessment included.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--34960264"&gt;Wharton Business School – AI Growing up&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;802 respondents in the US took this &lt;A href="https://ai.wharton.upenn.edu/focus-areas/human-technology-interaction/2024-ai-adoption-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/A&gt; earlier this year. Its not solely procurement but across business, and the goal was to take a pulse on where organisations are on their adoption of Gen Ai building from a survey the previous year.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The survey found that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;72% reported that they were using Gen AI once per week and that spending on Gen Ai had increased by 130% since 2023.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For procurement that number rises to 94% (from 50% 12 months ago) making procurement the highest function of all.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;“The biggest impact of Gen AI will be to augment my capabilities. [It will] automate routine tasks and provide 24/7 support to our customers, freeing me up to focus on [customer] empathy and more complex problem-solving.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Banking Leader, $100M - $250M Annual Revenue&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most leaders agree that its having a positive impact, within procurement 35% stated it was high, 41% stated it was medium and 18% said it was low. This was broadly in line with all other functions except IT (which was a higher, high impact).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Budgets were expected to rise in procurement for AI with the majority (58%) &amp;nbsp;suggesting between 1-10% increase over the next 2-5 years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s a great read which details the impact that Gen Ai is having and how it evolves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--231473769"&gt;AQPC Accounts Payable Practices&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href="https://www.apqc.org/resource-library/resource-collection/understanding-accounts-payable-benchmarks-and-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt; which surveyed 335 respondents, provides insights into accounts payable (AP) practices, focusing on process maturity, data standards, and technology implementation and highlights the growing trend towards automation, AI adoption, and cloud-based solutions in accounts payable processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Delivery Models&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;22% of respondents use an outsourced model for AP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;99% of respondents consider their delivery model effective, with 39% rating it as extremely effective&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI is being implemented across various P2P processes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;42% in procuring products and services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;37% in processing accounts payable&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;21% across the entire P2P process&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--427987274"&gt;State of Flux – SRM&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 16th annual Global SRM Research &lt;A href="https://srm.stateofflux.co.uk/2024-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Report&lt;/A&gt; emphasizes the critical role of supplier relationships in modern business, highlighting the shift from the Information Age to the Reputation and Relationship Age.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key Findings&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;46% of participants reported financial benefits above 4% per annum from their SRM programmes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;91% of Leaders monitor financial benefits beyond contracted spend for critical suppliers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Challenges&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Difficulty in capturing and reporting returns due to lack of accurate data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;19% said their company had no system in place to support contract lifecycle management (however, of Leaders, 82% do have a dedicated system).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;21% reported the systems they have to support performance management were ‘poor.’&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;23% said they had not yet developed a business case at all for supplier management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report underscores the transformative impact of strategic supplier management on organizational success but identified that there was a drop in organisations surveyed who qualified as leaders, which with the geopolitical changes happening is a concern due to the rising importance of supplier relationships and the changing of global supply chains.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--624500779"&gt;Everest CPO Agenda 2025&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This was taken from a &lt;A href="https://www2.everestgrp.com/reportaction/12Nov24-Webinar/Toc" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;webinar&lt;/A&gt; hosted by Everest earlier this month.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CPO Challenges and Priorities&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;External Challenges: Supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical events&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Internal Challenges: Budgetary constraints limiting ability to navigate external challenges&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Top Priorities for 2025:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cost reduction&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Minimizing supply chain disruptions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Improving operational efficiencies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Generative AI in Procurement&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;70% of respondents are open to implementing generative AI throughout the process value chain&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;52% are focusing on quick-win use cases&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The data points are sourced from Everests CPO report for 2024.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;As always reach out to discuss more, and always happy to hear your thoughts!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Dear everyone,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Given the date, I became curious about what has been written and predicted about next year, 2025, in terms of Procurement. I found some inspiration from 2-3 sources, which might have originated elsewhere (?), and decided to put it into a presentation for others (both internally and externally). When you think about it, the predictions probably won't come as big surprises. Technology is advancing rapidly, the world is turbulent in many ways, and we need to think about our future generations, all of which affect many things, including Procurement in 2025. I wish you all a fantastic New Year!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206184i238DCC28BFED4E44/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2.png" alt="2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206185iC76083C8C8A4251D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="3.png" alt="3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206186i7F1C8783A259AFAF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="4.png" alt="4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="5.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206187i0E401FB6B2CB5412/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5.png" alt="5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/206188i887DBF9FA9701651/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="6.png" alt="6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-950250073"&gt;Summary&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This month the reports emphasize the growing importance of supply chain visibility, with a particular focus on sub-tier risks and geopolitical concerns. It also discusses the transformative potential of AI in procurement, noting that over a third of organizations are already investing in this technology. Significant shifts in working capital management, the trend towards nearshoring and friendshoring in supply chains, and the expanding size of the global gig economy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-753736568"&gt;Procurement Leaders – Sub Tier Risks&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This &lt;A href="https://marketplace.procurementleaders.com/partners/gep/resources/new-approaches-uncovering-sub-tier-risks#new_tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt;, explores the evolving landscape of supply chain risk management and the increasing importance of sub-tier visibility for procurement and supply chain professionals. In the Economist Impact studies of the last few years Supply Chain Visibility has ranked at the top of priorities of risk, for procurement to focus on.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to the report there has been a significant change in the types of risks affecting supply chains. Low-probability, high-impact events (black swans) now account for 51% of past disruptions, compared to 27% in 2016. These risks manifest themselves around geopolitics. 27% of respondents identified geopolitics as their primary concern for the next 12 months, highlighting the need for improved supply chain tracing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;91% of survey respondents indicated limited or no confidence in their visibility of risks beyond the second tier with technology seen as essential for improving sub-tier visibility whilst 34% of respondents use supplier relationship management (SRM) and engagement initiatives to manage sub-tier risks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-557223063"&gt;&lt;A href="https://cips-download.cips.org/expert-reports/cips-ai-in-procurement-and-supply-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;CIPS AI in Procurement&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to the 2024 CIPS Global State of Procurement &amp;amp; Supply survey, over a third of organizations are already investing in AI, with 56.9% working towards greater automation. AI's potential to transform procurement is immense, from automating routine tasks to enhancing risk analysis and driving data-driven decision-making. However, the adoption of AI isn't without challenges, with only 30% of procurement professionals feeling prepared for its impact on their roles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI is expected to enhance productivity, allowing procurement teams to shift from time-consuming manual tasks to high-impact, strategic activities that drive innovation and align with organizational objectives. Data literacy, strategic thinking, analytical mindset, communication skills, and a commitment to continuous learning are crucial for success in the AI era. While some roles may be replaced by AI, new positions are emerging that combine data and technical expertise with traditional procurement skills&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-360709558"&gt;GEP Outlook 2025&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This &lt;A href="https://www.gep.com/research-report/gep-outlook-2025?utm_source=GDN&amp;amp;utm_medium=PMax_IH&amp;amp;utm_term=&amp;amp;utm_assetid=&amp;amp;utm_startdate=&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Branding_GLE_DS_PMax_GEP_IH_ANZ_AU_11283_Outlook_2025_Asset_6thJan%2725&amp;amp;utm_target=&amp;amp;utm_phyloc=1000286&amp;amp;utm_network=x&amp;amp;utm_device=c&amp;amp;utm_adposition=&amp;amp;utm_matchtype=&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAhP67BhAVEiwA2E_9gx74FOBOOh3hUkdZRIpQ5cJinWbWfjOVC3UeNMlzwLM9sIN7r63RRhoCQ08QAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt; looks at several transformative trends that will reshape procurement and supply chain management in the coming years. Unsurprisingly Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize operational models, moving from task automation to autonomous decision-making. AI-powered procurement orchestration tools will enable seamless self-service across the source-to-pay process, while AI agents will handle complex tasks like demand forecasting and risk monitoring. These advancements will allow procurement teams to focus on more strategic activities and drive greater value for their organizations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report also emphasizes a significant shift in how business value is defined in procurement. Cost savings are no longer the sole measure of success, with resilience, sustainability, regulatory compliance, and risk management becoming equally important. This evolution requires new metrics and KPIs to evaluate procurement performance, such as supply chain flexibility, carbon emissions reduction, and ethical compliance. Procurement leaders will need to communicate a more holistic view of value creation to their organizations, demonstrating how their decisions contribute to long-term business success beyond just cost savings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, the report underscores the changing global trade landscape and its impact on supply chains. Rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions are challenging traditional globalization models, prompting companies to consider strategies like friendshoring and nearshoring to enhance supply security&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-164196053"&gt;Hackett – Working Capital&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href="https://www.thehackettgroup.com/insights/2024-working-capital-survey-2408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;2024 Working Capital Survey&lt;/A&gt; by The Hackett Group reveals a concerning trend in the working capital management of the largest U.S. public companies. For the first time in a decade, these companies experienced simultaneous degradation across all major working capital metrics - days sales outstanding (DSO), days inventory outstanding (DIO), and days payables outstanding (DPO). This "triple threat" has led to a staggering $1.76 trillion in untapped working capital opportunity. The cash conversion cycle (CCC) of the top 1,000 companies increased by 4% from 36.4 days to 37.7 days, indicating a significant reversal of fortune in working capital performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The implications of these findings are significant for businesses. With persistently higher interest rates and DSO pushed to the limit, working capital improvements are more critical than ever. Finance executives need to take a proactive role in partnering with internal business partners to optimize working capital across the balance sheet. The report also emphasizes the potential of generative AI in transforming working capital management, particularly in areas such as accounts receivable processes, credit management, and supply chain optimization. Companies that can effectively leverage these technologies and implement robust working capital strategies will be better positioned to navigate volatile market conditions and unlock trapped liquidity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--32317452"&gt;KPMG – Proximity Premium&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the Economist Impact study last year, one of the longer term priorities identified for procurement was supplier diversification. This was due to the increasing geopolitical disruptions that many were expecting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This &lt;A href="https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2024/strategically-reshaping-supply-chains-in-the-americas.html?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=701cx000002UkVjAAK&amp;amp;utm_content=Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_id=96745&amp;amp;sfmc_id=00Q4W00001dPCdFUAW&amp;amp;subscriber_id=6612072" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt; identifies a significant shift in US supply chain strategies, with companies increasingly moving operations closer to home. According to the survey of 250 senior US executives, 69% of US-serving supply chains are expected to be based in the Americas within the next few years, up from 59% currently. This strategic shoring trend is driven by the need for greater agility, faster time to market, and better access to skills and talent. Companies are streamlining their supply chain routes within the Americas, with Mexico gaining prominence as the second-most popular country for US supply chains after the United States itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report highlights that while cost remains a primary consideration, companies are increasingly prioritizing long-term goals such as agility and sustainability in their supply chain strategies. This shift is expected to enhance the durability of business models in the face of disruptions. However, challenges remain, including navigating geopolitical risks, meeting sustainability targets, and managing the complexity of trade agreements and tax regulations. The research suggests that companies often struggle with these complexities, with tax expertise ranking as the second-most important area requiring improvement after data and analytics capabilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What this means is that organizations need to reassess their supply chain assumptions, harness the power of data and analytics for better decision-making, at the outset of supply chain decisions. The report emphasizes the importance of forging strong relationships with partners and suppliers, particularly those with local insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--228830957"&gt;Everest Group – Business Outcomes 2025&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This was a &lt;A href="https://www.everestgrp.com/webinars/mapping-the-next-key-priorities-for-2025-webinar.html#:~:text=This%20session%20spotlighted%20leaders'%20core,outsourcing%2C%20onshore%20vs." target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;webinar&lt;/A&gt; held toward the end of last year. The main points were the whilst organisations are optimistic about 2025 (80% somewhat or highly) cost and margin pressures remain at the top of biggest challenges. 61% of business identify enhancing profitability or cost optimisation, while 66% identified increased revenue growth as top priority. In a snap poll, 36% expected the political environment to have a negative impact to their business in 2025. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;As always reach out to discuss more, and always happy to hear your thoughts!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Chop up data insights and sprinkle in advanced digital tools. Mix well to ensure every decision is smarter and more efficient. This ingredient is key to setting a strong foundation for your procurement feast.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-815452735"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2: Sustainability Spice&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Next, add a pinch of Sustainability. This not only enhances the flavor but ensures your dish remains valuable for the long haul. Think of it as adding a blend of herbs and spices that bring out the best in your ingredients while keeping everything green and compliant with environmental standards.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-618939230"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3: Geopolitical Agility Zest&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For an extra kick, stir in some Geopolitical Agility.

These aromatics enhance your processes and reduce manual tasks, much like how garlic and onions elevate a dish’s aroma. Let the AI marinate in your processes, and watch how automation brings everything together seamlessly.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-225912220"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5: Supply Chain Resilience Robustness&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Finally, build the robustness of your dish with Supply Chain Resilience. This ingredient ensures your supply chain can withstand disruptions, much like a hearty stock that keeps a soup flavorful and consistent. Stir well to make sure every part of your procurement strategy is flexible and resilient.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-29398715"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Serving Your Procurement Masterpiece&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Serve your procurement strategy hot, garnished with success and efficiency.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A well-planned procurement process is essential for every successful buying organization. Think of it as a bustling marketplace where every transaction is meticulously planned to satisfy both buyers and suppliers. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Imagine a high-tech manufacturing company that needs to procure specialized components for their cutting-edge products. Their procurement team works diligently to identify the best suppliers, negotiate favorable terms, and ensure timely delivery. This meticulous process not only keeps the production line running smoothly, but also contributes to the company's reputation for quality and innovation. Thus, the procurement process is not just about buying goods and services, but about building relationships and creating value that drives the organization's success.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Spend Management Procurement Portfolio (4).jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/217535i92DB7926A93E4721/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Spend Management Procurement Portfolio (4).jpg" alt="Spend Management Procurement Portfolio (4).jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Nature of the Procurement Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The procurement process is inherently linear, following a step-by-step progression from identifying needs to performance evaluation. However, it is also cyclical and repetitive. Once the final stage of performance evaluation is completed, insights gained are fed back into the identification of needs for future procurement cycles. This continuous loop ensures that the process is dynamic and responsive to changing organizational requirements and market conditions. Essentially, the procurement process can be seen as an infinite cycle of improvement and adaptation, rather than a one-time event.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Importance of Communication via a Business Network&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensuring clear and consistent communication between the buyer and supplier is crucial for a successful procurement process. Effective communication helps in understanding needs, negotiating terms, and managing expectations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Providing timely updates on order status, delivery schedules, and any potential issues helps maintain transparency and trust. Business networks facilitate real-time communication, ensuring both parties are always informed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Quick resolution of any issues that arise during the procurement process is vital. Open channels of communication enable prompt identification and resolution of problems, minimizing disruptions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regular feedback from the buyer to the supplier and vice versa fosters continuous improvement. Constructive feedback helps suppliers refine their offerings and services, leading to better outcomes for both parties.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The procurement process is critical to a buying organization's success. By understanding and optimizing each stage, organizations achieve greater efficiency, cost savings, and strategic advantages. Best practices and technology enhance procurement effectiveness, contributing to growth and sustainability. As the business landscape evolves, a well-structured procurement process is key to long-term success.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1574520518"&gt;Summary&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reviewing this month’s reports, a narrative of transformation and adaptation emerges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the heart of this transformation is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence and digital technologies. Procurement teams are increasingly leveraging AI-powered platforms to automate routine tasks, freeing up valuable time for strategic decision-making. This shift is not without its challenges, as organizations grapple with implementation concerns and the need for upskilling their workforce.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cost reduction remains a cornerstone of procurement strategy, but it's no longer the sole focus. Teams are now expected to drive value creation across the business, balancing financial goals with sustainability and ethical sourcing. This expanded role has elevated procurement's strategic importance, with many teams now steering corporate strategy and collaborating closely with suppliers to fuel innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The geopolitical landscape continues to shape procurement priorities, with supply chain resilience taking center stage. Teams are bracing for potential "black swan" events, adapting their strategies to navigate inflation, sustainability regulations, and talent gaps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This focus on risk management has led to a shift in operating models, with many organizations centralizing their procurement functions and creating dedicated teams for supplier relationship management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technology investments are reshaping the procurement toolkit, with spend analytics, contract lifecycle management, and e-procurement solutions leading the way. The adoption of generative AI is accelerating, particularly in areas like contract management and risk analysis.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reviewing these reports its clear that the success of procurement teams will hinge on their ability to embrace these technological advancements, prioritize sustainability, and develop agile strategies to navigate an increasingly complex business environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1378007013"&gt;Procurious Next Level Procurement&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to the &lt;A href="https://www.procurious.com/procurement-news/next-level-procurement-embracing-genai-and-whatever-comes-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt; a study of 137 procurement leaders globally, Procurement’s future hinges on three pillars: tech adoption (especially AI), supplier collaboration, and strategic agility. As teams juggle cost pressures with ESG demands, the winners will be those using AI-powered platforms to automate grunt work and focus on big-picture value creation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report identifies that while 51% still prioritize cost reduction, teams are now steering corporate strategy, balancing sustainability with financial goals. Over half (54%) are doubling down on ethical sourcing, and 77% expect procurement to drive value creation across the business.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;60% of respondents say suppliers are their top stakeholders with the aim of building collaborative partnerships that fuel innovation and ESG wins. Half of procurement leaders plan to spend more time working directly with suppliers, especially as tariffs and geopolitical shifts force supply chain reshuffles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;45% of teams are already testing generative AI for tasks like contract management (44%) and risk analysis (57%). While 43% still hesitate about implementation, early adopters report efficiency boosts – 63% say it’s supercharging productivity. As one exec put it: “AI agents will fundamentally change how procurement pros spend their time.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With 81% bracing for another “black swan” event, resilience is non-negotiable. Top pressures include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Inflation (75%)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sustainability regulations (63%)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Talent gaps (58%)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most teams (74%) have overhauled strategies recently, but only 19% adapt quickly to sudden changes. The report suggests that the fix is more agile systems and tech investments that enable real-time pivots.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1181493508"&gt;Procureability – future proofing procurement&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to the &lt;A href="https://procureability.com/procurement-strategies-optimize-adapt-thrive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt;, Procurement’s role in 2025 hinges on cross-functional collaboration, AI adoption, and agile risk management. Teams that invest in upskilling, interoperable tech, and sustainability frameworks will drive measurable ROI while future-proofing operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI adoption is accelerating, with tools like contract clause analysis reducing cycle times by 30%&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;By 2027, 50% of organizations will use AI for supplier contract negotiations . Cybersecurity threats rose 30% in 2024 which procurement and organisations must seek to balance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cost reduction targets are increasing according to the paper, with hard savings targets of 7–10% which demand advanced strategies including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Deploy should-cost modelling and game theory negotiations .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Collaborate with finance to define clear savings metrics .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Embed ESG practices across Tier 2/3 suppliers to unlock long-term value .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-984980003"&gt;Amazon State of Procurement Data 2025&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to this &lt;A href="https://business.amazon.com/en/cp/state-of-procurement-data/thank-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/A&gt; of over 3000 respondents, (2500+ procurement – from all levels) and 650+ remaining c suite (non-procurement), Procurement’s evolution hinges on balancing cost efficiency with sustainability, technology, and collaboration. By embedding data-driven decision-making and advocating for strategic influence, leaders can cement procurement’s role as a growth catalyst.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Procurement is now a growth driver, with 59% of teams expecting budget increases. Yet, only 46% of decision-makers feel fully included in strategic forums. &amp;nbsp;64% of leaders prioritize AI and analytics to streamline operations, yet adoption lags—42% use AI for purchasing decisions (down 5% YoY).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supplier challenges surged, with 19% citing inadequate digital support (up 10% YoY). 65% of leaders prioritize talent retention, emphasizing skills in data analytics and strategic supplier management&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report suggests some interesting actions for procurement leaders including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Invest in AI-driven demand forecasting and spend analysis tools while upskilling teams to bridge the tech-talent gap&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Audit supplier capabilities and prioritize partners offering transparent communication, ESG compliance, and real-time inventory visibility&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Develop rotational programs to integrate procurement with cross-functional teams, fostering strategic thinking&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-788466498"&gt;Hackett – Key Issues Study&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This annual &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/dg/hackett-2025-procurement-key-issues-studies/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/A&gt;, which is highly anticipated within the procurement community (at least by myself anyway!) which is put together both through a survey and discussions with a wide range of procurement leaders and also wider organisational leaders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The future of procurement is digital, data-driven, and strategically aligned. Start preparing now to lead the charge in 2025 and beyond specifically:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Digital transformation is king: AI, automation, and real-time data visibility are set to revolutionize procurement. Embrace these technologies to stay competitive.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Skills gap alert: The procurement skill set is evolving. Invest in upskilling your team in areas like digital proficiency, data analytics, and sustainability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do more with less: Workloads are increasing, but budgets aren't keeping pace. Leverage technology to boost productivity and efficiency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Gen AI is here: Early adopters are already seeing benefits. Explore embedded Gen AI solutions in core procurement tools.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Operating model shake-up: Centralization is on the rise. Consider dedicated teams for supplier relationship management and risk management.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Analytics maturity matters: Most teams are stuck in descriptive analytics. Push towards predictive and prescriptive capabilities, especially in spend analytics.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sustainability takes center stage: ESG reporting is a top priority. Ensure your team can deliver on this growing demand.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-721035712"&gt;Priorities&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In terms of priorities spend cost reduction Remains the #1 priority as teams tackle economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures whilst Supply Continuity remains as the 2nd priority driven by geopolitical disruptions and shifting trade relations make securing supply chains a top focus.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Operating Model Transformation has risen to third place, this reflects the need to adapt to AI, stakeholder expectations, and process simplification and driving a digital transformation is 5th.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sustainability &amp;amp; ESG Integration driven by stakeholder demands for environmental and social accountability push sustainability to seventh place, up from ninth in 2024.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report identifies several areas for improvement as well, in areas including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Gen AI Implementation: Pilots in PO processing, spend analytics, and CLM show early promise, but concerns around data quality (73%) and IP leakage (48%) persist. Intelligent Automation: RPA and Gen AI lead deployments, with predictive AI and agile orchestration emerging as high-investment areas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Talent Upskilling was identified as a critical area as a growing skills gap in digital proficiency, analytics, and sustainability demands targeted training programs. Only 21% of organizations have dedicated procurement talent teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Operating Model Shifts, with 69% of resources are centralized, expected to rise to 71% by 2028, and dedicated teams building SRM, risk management, and COEs for analytics and supplier diversity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Analytics Maturity. Whilst most teams rely on descriptive analytics. Priority areas for growth should include predictive capabilities in spend analytics (56% plan upgrades) and prescriptive tools for ESG reporting&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-524522207"&gt;Technology&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When we look at the technology investment areas we can draw some good insights:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;60–74% of organizations already use end-to-end tools like spend analytics, CLM, and e-sourcing with planned investments being:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Spend analytics: 61% plan upgrades (highest priority) .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CLM: 54% aim to enhance contract lifecycle tools despite 30% of deployments underperforming expectations .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;E-procurement: 58% Favor embedded Gen AI solutions to streamline catalogue management .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Emerging technologies identified include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Category management: 49% adoption, with 37% planning upgrades.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sustainability/ESG tools: 40% adoption, but 43% report solutions fell short of goals.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supplier collaboration: Low ROI (38% underperformance) driving re-evaluation of investment strategies.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Gen AI deployment:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;PO processing: 26% already implemented, 47% using embedded solutions .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Spend analytics: 20% deployed, with 45% opting for custom-developed tools .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Investment focus:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Predictive AI: 56% plan new investments despite 33% underperformance .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;RPA: 50% adoption, but limited expansion plans .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report identifies that Organizations are doubling down on embedded Gen AI for CLM/e-procurement, custom analytics builds, and centralized operating models. Success hinges on addressing data quality gaps while scaling pilots in high-impact areas like spend analytics and supplier risk.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-198925983"&gt;RS/CIPS Indirect Procurement Study&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://uk.rs-online.com/web/content/mro/procurement-strategy/indirect-procurement-report?utm_campaign=2025.CIPS+Download+%7C+22%2F01%2F25+%7C+ROW&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Wavecast" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;The 2025 Indirect Procurement Report,&lt;/A&gt; produced by RS and CIPS, reveals a challenging landscape for procurement professionals. Inflation remains the top concern, with 62% of respondents identifying it as a major issue. Supply chain risk management and global political uncertainty are also significant challenges. Managing risk in the supply chain (47%) and global political uncertainty (37%) are significant challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The report highlights a growing focus on ESG initiatives, with 64% of respondents considering ESG important for company strategy. However, economic pressures have led to a decrease in willingness to pay premiums for sustainable products. Procurement teams are adopting strategies to improve efficiency, including supplier consolidation and driving value through partnerships.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The use of digital procurement systems is increasing, with 62% of professionals now using eProcurement or supplier punchout systems. MRO spend has increased by 20% over the past year, reflecting a trend towards maintaining rather than replacing equipment. The report also identifies areas for improvement, including a lack of knowledge about order processing costs and the need for better relationships with internal stakeholders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Overall, the findings suggest that procurement professionals must balance cost pressures with sustainability goals while leveraging technology and strategic partnerships to drive efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-2412478"&gt;Payments – Money Mobility Tracker&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Check fraud remains a significant threat to businesses and consumers, causing substantial financial losses despite advancements in digital payment technologies. The &lt;A href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/binance-tops-pymnts-provider-rankings-of-us-cryptocurrency-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt; emphasizes the critical need for businesses to transition from paper checks to digital payment methods.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Despite security vulnerabilities, 68% of U.S. companies still use checks for B2B payments, accounting for nearly 40% of all U.S. B2B payment volume. Nine in 10 bankers have experienced higher levels of check fraud in recent years, with 28% of banks noting an increase of more than 50% in the past three years. &amp;nbsp;Nearly 25% of small to midsized businesses (SMBs) fell victim to check fraud, compared to 15% of the general population&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Digital payments offer enhanced security features, including encryption, multi-factor authentication, and real-time transaction monitoring powered by AI. These advanced systems significantly reduce fraud risks, lower processing costs, and provide improved transaction visibility and operational efficiency. 77% of companies utilized instant payment technology in 2024, up from 62% the previous year. Almost all respondents reported that digital treasury processes improved cash flow forecasting (97%), enhanced financial visibility and control (96%), and boosted profits (91%)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--194101027"&gt;Beroe Category Forecast&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This comprehensive &lt;A href="https://www.beroeinc.com/resource-centre/insights/beroes-category-forecast-2025#:~:text=Beroe's%20Category%20Forecast%202025%20is,of%2016%20selected%20procurement%20categories." target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;report&lt;/A&gt; provides insights into key procurement categories for 2025, highlighting market trends, price forecasts, and strategic recommendations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-85722544"&gt;Engineering &amp;amp; Construction:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Global cement demand expected to increase by 3-4% in 2025&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Structural steel market projected to reach 253 MMT in 2025, with prices rising 10-14% in North America and Europe&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Modular construction market forecasted to hit $149.2 billion in 2025, growing 7.4% from 2024&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--110790961"&gt;Integrated Facilities Management:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;IFM services prices expected to increase 4-5% in 2025&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Key trends include focus on single-vendor partnerships, IoT integration, and Maintenance 4.0 adoption&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--307304466"&gt;Information Technology:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;IT services spending projected to grow 7-9% in 2025&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enterprise software spending expected to increase 10-12%&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Managed security services spending forecasted to grow 12-15%&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cloud computing costs predicted to rise 5-9% across various services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;IT hardware prices expected to increase 3-9% depending on the category&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--503817971"&gt;Labor:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Global staffing industry revenue projected to reach $675 billion in 2025, growing 6% annually&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;US temporary staffing market expected to hit $177.8 billion&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Salary increases forecasted at 3.9% in the US, 3.5-4% in EMEA, and 4-5% in APAC&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--700331476"&gt;Logistics:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Road freight operating costs expected to rise 1-2% in North America, Europe, and Asia, but up to 30% in Latin America&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Driver wages and fuel remain primary cost elements in road freight&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key trends across categories include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Increasing adoption of AI and automation technologies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Growing focus on sustainability and green initiatives&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Rising labor costs and skills shortages&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Geopolitical tensions impacting supply chains and pricing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Regulatory changes affecting various industries&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To navigate these challenges, procurement professionals should focus on:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Diversifying supplier bases&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Investing in technology and data analytics&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Prioritizing sustainability in sourcing decisions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Developing flexible and resilient supply chain strategies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enhancing workforce skills and adopting innovative hiring practices&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As we move into 2025, organizations must stay agile and informed to effectively manage costs, mitigate risks, and capitalize on emerging opportunities across these critical procurement categories.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;As always reach out to discuss more, and always happy to hear your thoughts!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This fourth post in my series gives an overview of latest UX innovations in &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass, products for managing your spend (procurement) and external workforce&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;. For SAP Ariba: the new Intake Management application and news for Category Management. For SAP Fieldglass, the highlight is the new Home Page, but we’ll also look at further UX improvements.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1574554088"&gt;SAP Ariba&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The recent UX innovations I’d like to present here are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The new SAP Ariba Intake Management application, with its great UX.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;UX enhancements in Category Management: Initiatives Overview and allowing category managers to store attachments.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1507123302"&gt;SAP Ariba Intake Management&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rather than having to go to many different systems to manage small and large procurement needs, from simple purchase requests to onboarding new service providers, SAP Ariba Intake Management gives you your “one stop shop” for all of a purchasers procurement requests. It provides a fast, simple, and intuitive single front door for all procurement requests, streamlining processes and shielding users from system complexity. This saves time, and avoids the frustration of dealing with multiple systems for ordering and tracking status.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule is also at hand to guide users, making it even easier.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: SAP Ariba Intake Management.

    <title>Embracing the Future: Chatbots, Copilots, and Agents in Procurement</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;One of my earliest memories of advanced technology involves voice recognition software. I was home from college, getting ready to fly back to school, when I overheard my dad on the phone. He was struggling to communicate with the airline’s automated system. He repeated my airline's name twice, carefully enunciated my flight number, and then, in frustration, shouted "Operator!" multiple times.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since then, we’ve moved from automated systems through the phone to in-home virtual assistants like Siri, Google or Alexa. These advancements have made our lives significantly easier, and they continue to evolve.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technology has grown by leaps and bounds – and it’s not just limited to voice recognition. It’s also playing a crucial role in simplifying complex procurement processes and enhancing user experiences. Today, voice recognition is just one of the many tools helping to automate and streamline operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Among the most transformative technologies are AI-assisted chatbots, copilots, and agents, which are revolutionizing how procurement professionals interact with systems and data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Chatbots&lt;/STRONG&gt; have been around for a while. They started off by handling basic queries, but their capabilities have expanded significantly with the advent of generative AI (GenAI). Now, chatbots can understand and process natural language, which makes each interaction more intuitive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Copilots&lt;/STRONG&gt; offer sophisticated, conversational capabilities. They act as &lt;SPAN&gt;strategic assistants &lt;/SPAN&gt;and help procurement professionals navigate complex workflows and make informed decisions based on business context.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agents&lt;/STRONG&gt; are designed to autonomously perform complex, multistep workflows. They use AI to plan, reason, and execute tasks, allowing procurement teams to increase activity levels while also focusing on strategic objectives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How You Can Use Chatbots and Copilots &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In procurement, chatbots can guide users through procurement processes with predefined rules. They often provide standard responses to frequently asked questions on policies, processes, and procedures.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP's copilot, Joule, integrates seamlessly across SAP applications, including SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass solutions, to enhance procurement operations and leverage business context with historical data to guide users conversationally. Joule can also help with tasks like approvals, running reports, and answering questions like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Which suppliers have responded to our sourcing event?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Where are the time sheets I need to approve?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Who is the final approver for my high-profile project?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition to improving productivity, these technologies offer multiple benefits for procurement, such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced user experience. &lt;/STRONG&gt;Intelligence is directly embedded into the user interface, ensuring interactions are part of everyday activities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Streamlined processes. &lt;/STRONG&gt;Automation of tedious and complex tasks like generating RFxs makes it easier to ensure compliance and maximize efficiency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Better supplier management.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Advanced insights help teams manage supplier performance data to reduce risks and strengthen critical relationships.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Future of Agents&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In many ways, the frustration my dad experienced with that early voice recognition system feels like a &lt;SPAN&gt;distant memory. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;T&lt;/SPAN&gt;oday, we have numerous apps to help track flights. However, in some ways, the frustrations still feel relevant because some of these systems remain a work in progress. Regardless, it’s clear that technology is advancing with a focus on making it more intuitive and user-friendly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agents will revolutionize procurement by autonomously executing complex, multistep workflows and &lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2025/02/joule-sap-uniquely-delivers-ai-agents/?source=social-Brand_Story-Tier_1_Event-Video-Awareness-Global-N%2FA-Artificial_Intelligence-SAP_Business_Data_Cloud-SAP_Business_Suite-SAP_Business_Unleashed-SAP_News&amp;amp;campaigncode=CRM-YA23-SMS-1941768&amp;amp;sprinklrid=16126567562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;accelerating cross-functional operations&lt;/A&gt;, which will continuously run and ultimately free up resources. These agents will work alongside you and your colleagues, ensuring collaboration and oversight while enhancing efficiency and accuracy in procurement processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As these technologies evolve, they will transform procurement from a process-driven function to a strategic enabler.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Take the Next Step&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Learn more about how these innovations are shaping the future of procurement.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hi Friends, let us look at some of the exciting features in purchase requisitions for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2502.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Order Acknowledgment and Advance Shipping Notification for a Purchase Requisition Item&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using the app&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;My Purchase Requisitions - New&lt;/STRONG&gt;, in the context of central requisitioning, you can now view the follow-on documents for a purchase requisition item such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Order Acknowledgment&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which is a confirmation from a supplier to deliver specified quantities of products at specified prices within specified times, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advance Shipping Notification&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which contains information provided by the supplier about times of issue and receipt for specific quantities of ordered materials.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As an employee, in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;My Purchase Requisitions – New&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;app, you can now view the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Order Acknowledgment&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advance Shipping Notification&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Status Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the purchase requisition item.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For service items or enhanced limit, the order acknowledgment and advance shipping notification document is not supported and will not appear in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Status Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;View Parked Invoice in the Status Details of a Purchase Requisition Item&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using the app,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;My Purchase Requisitions – New&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;app, you can now view the parked invoice as a follow-on document for the purchase requisition item.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It can be viewed in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Status Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the purchase requisition item. The parked invoice is a type of supplier invoice, where the already entered data is retained until the required information to post the invoice document is obtained.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Support of Advanced Purchase Order Scenarios in Process Purchase Requisitions (V2)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can now create purchase orders for purchase requisitions with advanced fields from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Process Purchase Requisition (V2)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For instance, when you are creating a purchase order for a purchase requisition with purchase requisition item category&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;U&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;(stock transfer PR) or purchase requisition document type&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;UB&lt;SPAN&gt;, a message is displayed with simulation check performed for&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Manage Purchase Orders&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, then the purchase order is automatically created and you are navigated to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Display Purchase Order - Advanced&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;app to view the purchase order.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Process Purchase Requisitions&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This app is deprecated and will be removed from the SAP Fiori Launchpad in a future release. We recommend that you switch to the successor app&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Process Purchase Requisitions (V2)&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;at your earliest convenience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;CDS Views in Purchase Requisition&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the CDS view, &lt;STRONG&gt;I_PurchaseRequisitionItemAPI01&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the following fields are now available&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I_Purchaserequisitionitem.IsPurReqnCmplt&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I_Purchaserequisitionitem.PurReqnItemBlockingReasonText&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I_Purchaserequisitionitem.InventorySpecialStockType&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I_Purchaserequisitionitem.QuotaArrangement&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I_Purchaserequisitionitem.QuotaArrangementItem&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;OData V2 API:&amp;nbsp;Purchase Requisition&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The API service&amp;nbsp;API_PURCHASEREQ_PROCESS_SRV&amp;nbsp;is deprecated with the release&amp;nbsp;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2402. We recommend you switch to the successor API service&amp;nbsp;API_PURCHASEREQUISITION_2&amp;nbsp;as soon as possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Identity and Access Management &lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following changes to identity and access management (IAM) objects have been delivered for Purchase Requisitions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Name of IAM Object&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Object Type&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Changes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Relevant Scope Items&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Materials Management - Purchase Requisition Completion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(SAP_MM_BC_PR_COMPLETION_PC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Materials Management - Advanced Purchase Requisitions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(SAP_MM_BC_PR_MANAGE_PC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Materials Management - Purchasing Document Display&lt;/STRONG&gt;(SAP_MM_BC_PURCH_DOC_DSP_PC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Materials Management - Employee Self Services V2&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(SAP_MM_BC_SSPPR_MANAGE_PC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business Catalog&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Removal of Phase In&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;The phase in is removed and restriction is now enforced for the authorization object&amp;nbsp;PROJ_BILLG.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;18J (Requisitioning), O8J (Requisitioning), BMD (Purchase Contract), BNX (Consumable Purchasing), 1XI (Central Requisitioning)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Materials Management - Purchase Requisitions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;(SAP_MM_BC_PR_PROCESS_MC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business Catalog&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enable restriction for&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;F4&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Read&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;The restriction types AUART (Sales Document Type), AUFART_WERKS (Order Type/Plant), BEGRU_MAT (Authorization Group for Product) and BEGRU_MATKL (Authorization Group for Product Group) are updated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;18J (Requisitioning)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Materials Management - Purchase Requisitions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;(SAP_MM_BC_PR_PROCESS_MC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business Catalog&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enable restriction for&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;F4&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;The restriction types AUTYP (Order Category), BEGRU_MTART (Authorization Group for Product Type), and S4PPM_PR1 (Enterprise Project) are updated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;18J (Requisitioning)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Materials Management - Purchase Requisitions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(SAP_MM_BC_PR_PROCESS_MC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business Catalog&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enable restriction for&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Read&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;The restriction types PP_MRP_CTRLR (MRP Controller), BEGRU_LFA1 (Authorization Group for Suppliers), KTOPL (Chart of Accounts) and KTOKK (Supplier Account Group), are updated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;18J (Requisitioning)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Guided Buying for Central Procurement with SAP Ariba Buying (3EN)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this feature, the street fields,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Street 2&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Street 3&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the 3EN (&lt;STRONG&gt;Guided Buying for Central Procurement with SAP Ariba Buying&lt;/STRONG&gt;) purchase requisition are replicated and are available in the central system purchase requisition.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This blog post explains how to provision users to SAP Ariba using the SAP Cloud Identity Services—Identity Provisioning Service (IPS). Typically, you can create and provision new users to SAP Ariba through various methods such as:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Self-registration&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CSV file upload&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Provisioning via IPS from existing user stores (e.g., Microsoft AD, AS ABAP, SAP SuccessFactors)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;More information about&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integrating&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP Ariba&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;with SAP Cloud Identity Services can be found on &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity/system-integration-guide/sap-ariba-integration-scenario" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt; While there are multiple options, this post focuses on using SAP Identity Provisioning to provision users from SAP Cloud Identity Service (Identity Authentication).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: For guidance on integrating Cloud Identity Services with SAP Ariba (for Single Sign-On and identity federation), see the blog post here:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/identity-federation-sap-ariba-sso-with-sap-cloud-identity-services-identity/ba-p/13666666" target="_blank"&gt;Identity Federation &amp;amp; SAP Ariba SSO with SAP Cloud Identity Services&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1834658699"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use-Case Scenario&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Integrating Cloud Identity Services with SAP Ariba is just one example of how enterprises can unify identity management across various SAP solutions (e.g., SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Business Network, SAP Category Management, SAP Fieldglass). Centralizing identities in SAP Cloud Identity Service is an essential part of an enterprise-wide identity strategy. It also aligns with future SAP initiatives such as SAP Task Center and Joule, which rely on users being managed in Cloud Identity Service.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Identity Authentication and Identity Provisioning play a critical role in integrating SAP Ariba and other SAP BTP applications. They enable the use of a Global User ID—an attribute that uniquely identifies a user across the system landscape—serving as a prerequisite for adopting tools like SAP Task Center.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1638145194"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Architecture Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The architecture diagram for this scenario primarily highlights how to provision identities to SAP Ariba via Identity Provisioning. Similar concepts can also apply to other SAP Ariba SaaS solutions such as SAP Business Network, SAP Category Management, and SAP Fieldglass.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Blank diagram (2).png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/238045i13BDBFEF34ADF8E2/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Blank diagram (2).png" alt="Blank diagram (2).png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we will cover:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creating Ariba users in SAP Cloud Identity Service using both ODM and a custom Ariba schema.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Setting up SAP Ariba as the target system and Identity Authentication as the source system.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configuring the IPS transformation file to map Identity Authentication user attributes to SAP Ariba user attributes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configuring IPS jobs to provision users to SAP Ariba.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Planning the migration from the custom Ariba Cloud Identity Service schema to the standard SAP Ariba schema (once released).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1312548970"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create Ariba Users in SAP Cloud Identity Service Using ODM and a Custom Ariba Schema&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond the standard/core user attributes in SAP Cloud Identity Service, SAP Ariba requires additional attributes (such as purchasing unit, purchasing organization, plant, etc.). To handle these, two extension schemas come into play:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ODM Schema&lt;/STRONG&gt;: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:sap.odm:2.0:User&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Ariba Schema&lt;/STRONG&gt;: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:sap:ariba:2.0:User&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Service has recently released&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Open Domain Model (ODM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; schema support, enabling additional business attributes (e.g., companyCode, purchasingOrganization) in the Cloud Identity Service user profile. The ODM schema and attributes can be found under &lt;STRONG&gt;Users &amp;amp; Authentication&lt;/STRONG&gt; → &lt;STRONG&gt;Schemas&lt;/STRONG&gt; in your Cloud Identity Service.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 9.08.53 PM.png" style="width: 565px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/238046iA8F0521400DF1C86/image-dimensions/565x192?v=v2" width="565" height="192" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 9.08.53 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 9.08.53 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 9.13.07 PM.png" style="width: 561px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/238047i13255248A93F6653/image-dimensions/561x308?v=v2" width="561" height="308" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 9.13.07 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-19 at 9.13.07 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: As of this writing, the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Ariba Schema&lt;/STRONG&gt; (urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:sap:ariba:2.0:User) is planned for release in Q2 2025&lt;FONT size="2"&gt; (&lt;EM&gt;subject to change based on the SAP Cloud Identity Service product roadmap&lt;/EM&gt;)&lt;/FONT&gt;. In the interim, a custom schema must be created, which you will later migrate to the standard SAP Ariba schema once it becomes available.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1245118184"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Steps to Create a Custom SAP Ariba Schema&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can create the custom schema either via Postman or directly in the Cloud Identity Service interface. Below are the steps for creating it through the Cloud Identity Service UI:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigate to Schemas&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the Cloud Identity Service console, go to &lt;STRONG&gt;Users &amp;amp; Authorizations&lt;/STRONG&gt; → &lt;STRONG&gt;Schemas&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create New Schema&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click &lt;STRONG&gt;Create&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;Add&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and enter a name for your custom schema.&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 4.07.35 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/238049i5A2CDD10B704139F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 4.07.35 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 4.07.35 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Important&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The custom schema name (&lt;STRONG&gt;urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:vendor:ariba:2.0:User&lt;/STRONG&gt;) must be different from the future standard schema name (&lt;STRONG&gt;urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:sap:ariba:2.0:User&lt;/STRONG&gt;) to avoid conflicts once the standard schema is released.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 4.10.45 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/238820i9FF73297B996F75B/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 4.10.45 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 4.10.45 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Define Schema Attributes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Add the additional attributes (e.g., currency, deliverTo, passwordAdapter, addresses).&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 4.16.11 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/238823i5305EBE1AA5A060F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 4.16.11 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-24 at 4.16.11 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1048604679"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create an Ariba User Using ODM and the Custom Ariba Schema in Cloud Identity Service&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create a System User&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the Cloud Identity Service console, go to &lt;STRONG&gt;Users &amp;amp; Authorizations&lt;/STRONG&gt; → &lt;STRONG&gt;Administrators&lt;/STRONG&gt; → &lt;STRONG&gt;Add System&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Generate the Client ID and Client Secret, ensuring you have &lt;STRONG&gt;Manage Users&lt;/STRONG&gt; permissions&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.

Once SAP releases it (currently planned for Q2 2025&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;(&lt;EM&gt;subject to change based on the SAP Cloud Identity Service product roadmap&lt;/EM&gt;)&lt;/FONT&gt;), follow these steps to migrate from your custom schema:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Update Existing Users&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Perform an &lt;STRONG&gt;Update&lt;/STRONG&gt; operation on all Ariba users in Cloud Identity Service, replacing the custom schema (urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:&lt;STRONG&gt;vendor:ariba&lt;/STRONG&gt;:2.0:User) with the standard schema (urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:&lt;STRONG&gt;sap:ariba&lt;/STRONG&gt;:2.0:User).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Populate Attributes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Confirm that attributes are correctly mapped and populated in the new standard schema.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adjust Source and Target Transformation Files&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Replace all references to the custom schema with the standard Ariba schema.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Run IPS Jobs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Execute your IPS provisioning jobs again to ensure the updated schema references are correct and that data syncs as expected.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-133467940"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;By following the steps outlined in this blog, you can successfully create and manage SAP Ariba users through SAP Cloud Identity Service, leveraging both the ODM schema and a custom Ariba schema (until the standard one is released). Identity Provisioning Service streamlines the process, allowing you to filter and transform user data from Identity Authentication into SAP Ariba. Once SAP releases the standard SAP Ariba schema, you can seamlessly migrate your custom Ariba schema, further simplifying your identity landscape and supporting broader initiatives like SAP Task Center and Joule.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;By Lisa Heinrich, Senior Solution Value Advisor, Finance and Spend Management, SAP&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I recently tuned in to the Procurement Leaders’ session, “Leveraging AI for Category Management,” featuring Nouh Abed Assad, COO of SAP’s Global Procurement Organization, hosted by Ian Lawless from Procurement Leaders and joined by Barri Horn, SAP’s Director of Product Marketing. I have to say—it was one of the most energizing and eye-opening sessions I’ve attended in a while.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What made it so compelling? It wasn’t a sales pitch. It was SAP pulling back the curtain on how we’re using our own SAP Ariba Category Management tools to transform procurement from the inside out. The honesty, the detail, and the practical insights captured and held my interest from beginning to end.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nouh shared SAP’s journey methodically and with clarity, showing how a category-driven model supported by AI is helping SAP’s business shift from tactical execution to strategic impact. What resonated most with me was his emphasis on category management as a “living, breathing process”—not just a one-time exercise. It’s about aligning with business goals, understanding market shifts, and tracking outcomes that matter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any strong sourcing and procurement organization should have a category plan. But when Nouh described how AI-powered tools like generative segmentation and market dynamics analysis are now part of SAP’s daily procurement playbook, I got excited. These tools aren’t just flashy extras. They help category managers challenge assumptions, spot opportunities, and build smarter, faster strategies that they can share with their stakeholders. As Nouh put it perfectly: “Savings come from doing the right work; AI just helps us do it smarter.”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;He also underscored a critical point relevant to adopting new tools: planning, change management, and procurement best practices are non-negotiables. Without structure and team buy-in, even the best tools often fail to gain traction with business users. His advice? “You should have implemented it yesterday.” That one stuck with me—I’ve wanted to say that to so many customers I’ve worked with over the years. Honestly, I’ve even thought about putting it on a bumper sticker!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As someone in SAP’s Solution Value Advisory team, I work closely with customers every day help them get the most out of SAP Ariba solutions to drive adoption. Seeing the very strategies and tools I champion brought to life within SAP itself was incredibly validating. Whether I’m leading workshops or helping businesses define their solution value road map, I often point to SAP Ariba Category Management as a critical addition for long-term procurement success.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Category management—especially when powered by AI—isn’t just about cost savings. It’s about unlocking long-term value, supporting sustainability goals, and strengthening collaboration across the business. This session reinforced how real that value is and how accessible it can be when strategy, technology, and people align.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’re pondering where to begin, these tips may help:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Standardize your approach.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Invest in change management.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Start small—but start NOW.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP’s story isn’t just a vision—it’s already a rapidly evolving reality. And after watching this session, I’m more energized than ever to help others get there, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now it’s your turn! &lt;A href="https://www.bigmarker.com/procurement-leaders/leveraging-ai-for-category-management?utm_bmcr_source=PLwebsiteOnDemand" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Register here&lt;/A&gt; today to watch this informative session on demand.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;At SAP, we practice what we preach. Our Global Procurement Office (GPO) leads by example, embracing our own innovative solutions. The GPO has fully integrated SAP Ariba solutions – including our AI-assisted SAP&amp;nbsp;Ariba Category Management solution – into SAP’s procurement processes from start to finish. By using our own tools, we're not just talking about innovation – we're living&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In a recent webinar with Procurement Leaders on best practices for leveraging AI in category management, Nouh Abed Asaad, Chief Operating Officer at SAP's GPO, discussed why he and his team are proactively implementing digital tools across procurement, with an emphasis on AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Exploiting Technology to Streamline Processes and Meet Corporate Objectives &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The GPO uses SAP technology to expedite procurement processes, foster close collaboration with stakeholders, and ensure alignment with corporate objectives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Throughout the webinar, Asaad highlighted the power of digital tools to help break down data silos and build bridges across the organization. "In the past, everyone had their PowerPoint presentation, Excel files, emails, and his or her own story,” he said. “With our implementation of SAP Ariba Category Management, our goal was to bring everything to one standard to show the business units what they get when they work with procurement."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This unified approach isn't just about consolidation; it's about enhancing the decision-making process. Asaad explained, "We're bringing actionable insights and additional data to our category strategy definition, not only connecting our own data and making sure it's accurate and correct but also enriching it with external market data to make better decisions to improve our category."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Asaad also emphasized how procurement plays a crucial role in meeting real-world business needs, particularly in sustainability efforts. "We have a clear commitment toour net-zero strategy,” he said. “Our scope 3 emissions are 70-75% of our total emissions. Without procurement, you will never meet your sustainability targets."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP technology has been pivotal in helping the GPO achieve key corporate objectives, from data-driven decision-making to sustainability goals.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Ariba Category Management with AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The GPO operates in three regional hubs – the Americas, EMEA, and APJ – across 40 locations worldwide, overseeing the purchase of a wide range of products and services for SAP. &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Whether procuring IT hardware or automobiles for the car fleet, the team uses SAP’s suite of procurement solutions, including SAP Ariba Category Management with AI, and often serves as an early adopter of new technology.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Category management is implemented by sourcing champions who play a critical role in optimizing spend and driving value. This approach delivers benefits across four main areas, helping to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduce system disruptions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support data-driven decision-making&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensure transparency and buy-in&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review progress against objectives&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Ariba Category Management transforms the team’s ability to collect and analyze operational data, enrich it with external market information, and use built-in frameworks to strengthen recommendations for budget owners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Asaad explains, "I’ve always made decisions based on my expertise, but the Category Management tool allows me to support these decisions with Porter's 5 Forces and the Kraljic Matrix. I know what I'm doing, but my budget owner needs to see that. The tool shows them the deep-dive analysis of the spend and the breakdown with the Kraljic Matrix, along with the market analysis using Porter's Five Forces. I've defined an initiative to help you, the budget owner, get better value for your money. With that you will get better stakeholder buy in, really showing how professionally we can optimize their spend and drive value."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The team tracks success and progress through KPIs like cost savings and supplier performance. By measuring and reporting on these metrics, they demonstrate procurement's impact on the bottom line and justify continued investment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Implementation and Change Management Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The GPO’s journey demonstrates the power of thoughtful implementation and execution. From the initial three- to four-month rollout to ongoing usage, they've seen firsthand how strategic planning can drive transformative change.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To enhance awareness and adoption of the new solution, the team hosted several training sessions and worked closely with key stakeholders and budget owners. "We started category days where we brought the GPO organization together with key stakeholders, and each category presented their key strategy,” Asaad says. “Since then, we have done this on a six-month basis, showing the changes over time for each category and getting everybody onboard."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Through SAP Ariba Category Management with AI, the GPO can easily:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Connect processes, data, and user experiences across systems&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Share recommendations based on supplier fragmentation, price variances, tail spend, supplier diversity, and more&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make data-driven decisions with actionable insights and enriched supplier data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensure transparency and stakeholder buy-in to manage change proactively&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review progress against key objectives and clear metrics&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI enhances the team’s efficiency in understanding market dynamics and supporting optimal pricing strategies with key suppliers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adopting AI: Strategic Considerations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many practitioners are hesitant to adopt AI due to lack of understanding or trust in the technology. "In my organization, 90% are really afraid of the solution and 10% are absolutely excited,” Asaad says. “It's changing the way we have to think in the future. The earlier you adopt, the better you will manage it."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And regarding whether organizations should implement AI solutions now or wait, Asaad advises, "You should have implemented it yesterday. If you wait until the tool is more mature, the challenges of adopting AI will increase. At this point, we're still smarter than the AI advancements and recommendations, so we can correct, interact, and learn and grow with the tool. If we wait, it will overwhelm us."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By starting now, teams can gradually develop AI expertise and help shape how the technology is integrated into key processes within the organization. Delaying adoption may result in a steeper learning curve and less control or understanding for how AI works.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By using SAP solutions, the GPO is not only optimizing procurement processes but also sharing valuable insights that drive product development and enhance customer value. This “SAP Runs SAP” approach demonstrates the real-world impact of our AI-powered procurement solutions and sets a high bar for excellence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Listen to the Procurement Leaders webinar on demand to learn more about, &lt;A href="https://www.bigmarker.com/procurement-leaders/leveraging-ai-for-category-management?utm_bmcr_source=PLwebsiteOnDemand" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Leveraging AI for Category Management.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1581193445"&gt;Definition&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Category management in procurement is a strategic approach that organizes procurement resources to focus on specific areas of spend. This method divides products and services into categories which are managed as a whole, rather than individually.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By grouping similar items, organizations can streamline processes and develop targeted strategies for each category. It fosters a deeper understanding of procurement needs, supplier relationships, and market trends, resulting in a more efficient and effective procurement process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1384679940"&gt;Why Is It Important?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transitioning from the definition, it is essential to understand the unique advantages that category management offers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1317249154"&gt;Cost Savings&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Category management enables organizations to leverage their buying power by consolidating purchases within specific categories. This strategic approach helps in negotiating better prices and terms with suppliers, leading to significant cost savings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Companies can identify and eliminate inefficiencies, reduce waste, and achieve more favorable pricing structures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, according to a Deloitte Global CPO Survey, organizations implementing category management have reported cost reductions of up to 15% (Deloitte, 2023).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1120735649"&gt;Improved Supplier Relationships&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Focusing on specific categories allows procurement professionals to develop closer and more collaborative relationships with key suppliers. This fosters trust and cooperation, leading to improved quality, reliability, and innovation. Strong supplier relationships also provide the opportunity for joint problem-solving and long-term partnerships, enhancing overall supply chain performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a real-time example, consider the automotive industry. According to a study conducted by McKinsey &amp;amp; Company, companies that implemented category management strategies reported a 12% improvement in supplier reliability and an 8% increase in innovation through collaborative efforts (McKinsey, 2022). These numbers highlight the significant impact that focusing on specific categories can have on supplier relationships and overall industry performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-924222144"&gt;Enhanced Market Insights&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Category management involves thorough market analysis and understanding of industry trends, which helps organizations stay ahead of the curve. By continuously monitoring the market, companies can identify emerging opportunities, mitigate risks, and adapt to changes more effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This proactive approach enables better decision-making and strategic planning. Market intelligence gathered through category management supports organizations in responding swiftly to market shifts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a real-time example, consider the retail industry. According to a study conducted by KPMG in 2021, companies that implemented category management reported a 10% increase in market responsiveness and a 7% reduction in risks associated with supplier partnerships. These figures highlight the substantial impact of market insights gained through category management on overall business performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-727708639"&gt;Additional Reasons&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Risk Management:&lt;/STRONG&gt; By having a comprehensive view of each category, organizations can better assess and manage risks associated with suppliers and market fluctuations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Efficiency:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Streamlining procurement processes within categories leads to more efficient operations, reducing time and resources spent on managing individual transactions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Compliance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Ensuring that all procurement activities within categories adhere to regulatory requirements and company policies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Innovation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Encouraging suppliers to bring innovative solutions and ideas by fostering strategic partnerships.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sustainability:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Promoting sustainable practices and sourcing by focusing on specific categories and collaborating with suppliers who adhere to environmental standards.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-402112415"&gt;Who Is the Target Group?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Understanding the target audience for category management within a procurement organization is crucial for ensuring successful implementation and achieving the desired benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Both primary and secondary audiences play significant roles in driving the initiative forward. Recognizing these audiences helps tailor communication and training e@orts, which is essential for organizational alignment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-334681629"&gt;Primary Audience&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Chief Procurement O0icers (CPOs):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Responsible for overall procurement strategy and performance, CPOs benefit from category management by gaining a streamlined approach to procurement, enabling better decision-making, and achieving significant cost savings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Category Managers:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They directly manage specific categories of spend. Category management empowers them with deeper market insights, better supplier relationships, and improved negotiation power, allowing them to deliver enhanced value to the organization. By equipping category managers with robust analytical tools and frameworks, organizations enable more strategic sourcing and supplier management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Procurement Analysts:&lt;/STRONG&gt; These professionals analyze data and trends to support procurement decisions. With category management, they can focus their analyses on specific spend areas, leading to more accurate and actionable insights. This specialization enhances their ability to identify cost-saving opportunities and drive process improvements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-138168124"&gt;Secondary Audience&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance Teams: &lt;/STRONG&gt;They benefit from the cost savings and budget predictability that category management offers, assisting in more accurate financial planning and reporting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Operations Managers:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Operations benefit from improved procurement processes and supplier reliability, leading to smoother operations and reduced disruptions in the supply chain.&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IT Departments:&lt;/STRONG&gt; As procurement increasingly leverages technology, IT departments support the infrastructure and tools needed for effective category management. They benefit from clearly defined procurement categories that align with organizational goals. Their involvement ensures that digital solutions are tailored to procurement’s evolving needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In summary, category management in procurement is a strategic initiative that benefits various stakeholders within an organization. By understanding the needs and roles of both primary and secondary audiences, procurement professionals can ensure successful implementation and maximize the advantages of this approach. This interconnectedness is crucial for building a resilient and agile procurement function.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="IMG_3714.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/260854i64DB6349CE9162C3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="IMG_3714.jpeg" alt="IMG_3714.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Joule is the SAP AI copilot - a virtual assistant that uses a conversational interface to help users of SAP business applications complete tasks more efficiently.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The conversational interface is brought to life with the help of these 4 interaction patterns:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;With &lt;STRONG&gt;informational interactions &lt;/STRONG&gt;we are providing our users knowledge-based results. All SAP applications in which Joule is available make their knowledge-base available via Joule, e.g. SAP Help Documentation. This is managed by SAP and offered to every Joule user out of the box.&lt;BR /&gt;We‘re also bringing in Document Grounding with which we enable our customers to upload their customer-owned content, e.g. HR-policies, travel-policies, FAQs, and others, so that their users can ask questions based on these documents.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigational Pattern&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Easily &lt;STRONG&gt;navigate&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP applications by simply asking via natural language. Joule offers you a navigational link which opens the respective application and UI in a new browser tab. In the destination, a user can open Joule again and continue where they have left with the same conversation history.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Trans&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;actional interactions &lt;/STRONG&gt;provide our users with a direct entry point to the backend system. Triggering and influencing business processes with the power of natural language and AI. E.g. purchase orders which need to be reviewed and approved, job positions which are created or any other CRUD-interaction (create, read, update, delete) within SAP cloud applications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And a 4th, &lt;STRONG&gt;Analytical pattern&lt;/STRONG&gt; to enable analytical interactions based on JustAsk and SAP Analytics Cloud, enabling customers to leverage Joule for analytical queries. &lt;EM&gt;This is currently not implemented in Ariba.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;With the Q3 2025 release, Joule is being made available in the SAP Ariba applications of Guided Buying, Guided Sourcing and Supplier Management.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please note that AI copilot Joule in the aforementioned products will be in Early Access until September 19th, 2025 at which time it will be made generally available to customers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below is the complete list of Transactional and Navigational Joule skills which are available per application area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1.

Supplier Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Available Transactional Joule Skills&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Show Primary Contact Information of Supplier – Displays contact details of Supplier&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;List Suppliers ‘In Registration’ status - Displays a list of suppliers that have started the registration process but haven't submitted questionnaires for a specific number of days.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;List Suppliers ‘Invited’ status – Displays a list of the Suppliers that have been invited to register but haven’t responded to the invitation for a specific number of days&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Available Navigational Joule Skills&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigate to get Suppliers in Registration status&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigate to get Suppliers in Invited status&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, the Informational pattern is also available for the 3 applications which means Joule can assist users with your product-related questions by finding answers in the product documentation published on the SAP Help Portal. Along with an excerpt, it provides direct links to the relevant source documents, allowing you to explore the details further.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;COSTING&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All the above mentioned Joule skills are part of Joule base, which means you will not be charged any AI units for these.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;You should have enabled either of the below Joule SKUs from SAP store&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule Base SKU: 8019544&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule Premium SKU (includes AI Units): 8019164&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule will be able to understand and respond to queries in the following languages - English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, Greek, Polish.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;PREREQUISITES&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule leverages the SAP Business Technology Platform to simplify complex integration landscapes. So the very first prerequisite is a BTP account.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. SAP Ariba applications license :&lt;/STRONG&gt; You have a license for one or more of the aforementioned SAP Ariba applications in one of the supported data centers supported by Joule, as&amp;nbsp;Joule&amp;nbsp;is an embedded application that is integrated with SAP products. The currently supported data centers are listed &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/serviceguide/data-centers-supported-by-joule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. SAP BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt; : Joule leverages the SAP Business Technology Platform to simplify complex integration landscapes, which makes it the next prerequisite. You should have an enterprise global account on&amp;nbsp;SAP BTP. If you already have a global account in&amp;nbsp;SAP BTP, Joule entitlements can be added in the same global account.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To activate or setup Joule, you need to have the following BTP services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. SAP Cloud Identity Services&lt;/STRONG&gt; : SAP Cloud Identity Services are a group of services of SAP BTP which enable you to handle provision and integrate identity and access management between systems, providing you a seamless SSO experience across systems with the security. SAP Cloud Identity Services&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;bundled with an SAP cloud solution, which means you are entitled to one productive and one test tenant preconfigured with the SAP cloud solution (&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/tenant-model-and-licensing?q=bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Refer this link&lt;/A&gt;). You should have integrated the SAP Ariba application with Identity Authentication as Joule leverages the IAS setup of the SAP product for user login. (Refer this blog for details on &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/overview-sap-ariba-sso-with-sap-cloud-identity-services-identity/ba-p/13665483" target="_self"&gt;SAP Ariba SSO with SAP Cloud Identity Services&lt;/A&gt;.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. SAP Build Work Zone, Standard Edition&lt;/STRONG&gt; : To support navigation to different applications from&amp;nbsp;Joule&amp;nbsp;and handle role based access scenarios, you need to configure the navigation service of SAP Build Work Zone.&amp;nbsp;Joule&amp;nbsp;uses the navigation service component of SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition to resolve intent based navigation targets and configure additional content providers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;5. You have created a subaccount in your global account using the&amp;nbsp;SAP BTP&amp;nbsp;cockpit for provisioning Joule. A single Joule subscription can be integrated into multiple SAP products like SAP SuccessFactors, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition, or SAP Build Work Zone. However, one subscription of the Joule application can only be integrated with one tenant of an SAP product. This means you cannot include multiple systems of the same product in one Joule formation. You must ensure that there is one IAS tenant per single independent entity and operate every single independent entity from its own dedicated SAP BTP sub-account.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;LIMITATIONS AS OF Q3 2025 RELEASE&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Buyer Parent-Child MERP (Multi-ERP) realm setup issue in Guided Buying&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Joule does not currently support multi-tenant consolidation. To overcome this limitation Customers must run Joule Booster in every child realm. This also means there will be no data consolidation across the realms&lt;/P&gt;</content>

All SAP applications in which Joule is available make their knowledge-base available via Joule, e.g. SAP Help Documentation. This is managed by SAP and offered to every Joule user out of the box.&lt;BR /&gt;We're also bringing in Document Grounding with which we enable our customers to upload their customer-owned content, e.g. HR-policies, travel-policies, FAQs, and others, so that their users can ask questions based on these documents.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigational Pattern&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;- Easily&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;navigate&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;SAP applications by simply asking via natural language. Joule offers you a navigational link which opens the respective application and UI in a new browser tab. In the destination, a user can open Joule again and continue where they have left with the same conversation history.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Trans&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;actional interactions&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;provide our users with a direct entry point to the backend system. Triggering and influencing business processes with the power of natural language and AI. E.g. purchase orders which need to be reviewed and approved, job positions which are created or any other CRUD-interaction (create, read, update, delete) within SAP cloud applications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And a 4th,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analytical pattern&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;to enable analytical interactions based on JustAsk and SAP Analytics Cloud, enabling customers to leverage Joule for analytical queries.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This is currently not implemented in Ariba.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;With the Q3 2025 release, Joule is being made available in the SAP Ariba applications of Guided Buying, Guided Sourcing and Supplier Management.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please note that AI copilot Joule in the aforementioned products will be in Early Access until September 19th, 2025 at which time it will be made generally available to customers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For a&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;complete list of Transactional and Navigational Joule skills which are available per application area&lt;/SPAN&gt;, view our new blog:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/blogs/blogworkflowpage/blog-id/spend-management-blog-sap/article-id/2650" target="_blank"&gt;Joule 2508 Release Key Innovations&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1600384537"&gt;SAP Ariba Category Management Highlights&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ability to Set an Initiative as Obsolete in SAP Ariba Category Management (ARBCATA-463)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keeping your workspace organized is essential for focus and efficiency. With this feature you can now manually mark outdated initiatives as obsolete, easily closing those that are no longer relevant. This means your team will see only initiatives that matter, reducing clutter and helping everyone prioritize more effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="JesG_5-1753439334794.png" style="width: 457px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/291428iB3F85FC0945E6BB4/image-dimensions/457x274?v=v2" width="457" height="274" role="button" title="JesG_5-1753439334794.png" alt="JesG_5-1753439334794.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, the Initiatives Overview page now allows you to filter by multiple phases—including the Obsolete phase—so you can quickly get the view you need and keep data clean and actionable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="JesG_6-1753439334841.png" style="width: 594px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/291429i4B070A9869232CD5/image-dimensions/594x141?v=v2" width="594" height="141" role="button" title="JesG_6-1753439334841.png" alt="JesG_6-1753439334841.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standardized and Detailed Category Risk Assessment (ARBCATA-489)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Risk management is fundamental to strong category strategies.

With our latest release, we’re streamlining this process even further.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Within the invoice list you can use the Adapt Filters button to add several new filters to the filter bar. For additional information on how to adapt filters in the invoice list, see Adapting Filters and Creating Variants. The following filters are now available:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Company Code Country/Region&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supplier Country/Region&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Purchase Order&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new filters allow you to search the invoice list more precisely and accurately as seen in the image below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="JesG_3-1753439118799.png" style="width: 733px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/291426i8B6D863AAEA4FED1/image-dimensions/733x407?v=v2" width="733" height="407" role="button" title="JesG_3-1753439118799.png" alt="JesG_3-1753439118799.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Posting Date Automatically Updated During Automatic Processing (CIM-2920)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For organizations that use automatic processing for invoices in SAP Ariba, you likely set a default posting date—often the current date—when invoices are automatically submitted. With our new enhancement, if you have defined the default posting date as the current date, the system now dynamically updates the posting date to the exact current date right before the invoice is submitted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We understand that sometimes, there may be a delay between when automatic processing starts and when an invoice is actually submitted. In the past, this gap meant an invoice could end up with a posting date that was out of alignment with the real submission time, potentially causing confusion or even issues with financial reporting or compliance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the new enhancement, the posting date will always reflect the true date of submission—even if the process experiences minor delays. This change can have a major impact for finance and accounting teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="JesG_4-1753439118522.png" style="width: 492px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/291425i30C32A51A91044A5/image-dimensions/492x102?v=v2" width="492" height="102" role="button" title="JesG_4-1753439118522.png" alt="JesG_4-1753439118522.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Submission of Invoices Enriched by Data Attribute Recommendation (CIM-2965)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this feature, changes have been made to the automatic submission process for invoices enriched by data attribute recommendation. Now, when the confidence threshold for fields enriched by data attribute recommendation is between 0.5 and 0.7, the automatic submission is stopped, and you can review the fields within the invoice on the invoice detail page. You can then manually submit the invoice or adjust the invoice before submitting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data attribute recommendation can automatically enrich and complete the following fields in draft invoices:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;G/L Account&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost Center&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;WBS Element&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data attribute recommendation is a machine learning service that is trained with a set of invoices that you select. Once data attribute recommendation is trained and activated,&amp;nbsp;SAP Ariba CIM&amp;nbsp;can automatically complete missing fields in draft invoices using the data learned during the training.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For further details on these innovations and more, view our blog: &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/blogs/blogworkflowpage/blog-id/spend-management-blog-sap/article-id/2659" target="_blank"&gt;Central Invoice Management 2508 Release Key Innovations&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1012855384" id="toc-hId-488734293"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#333399"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Highlights from Supplier Management &amp;amp; Risk&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supplier Management Integration with WalkMe (SLP-2265)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This feature integrates SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance and SAP Ariba Supplier Information and Performance Management (new architecture) with WalkMe Digital Adoption Platform.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Gordon Donovan's, Global Vice President Research, Procurement &amp;amp; External Workforce at SAP, recent conversations with the Procurement Leaders, clearly states that we are currently living in a world of "Polycrisis" - a mix of geopolitical, environment and macroeconomics risks, where Procurement is right on the front lines. Instead of just focusing on cost savings, the role of procurement has become one of Risk Management and Strategic Value Creation and AI plays a critical role in making this shift possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These conversations emphasis that AI is a not a buzz word but is a critical tool for facing today's reality. The procurement leaders have pointed out the few key areas where AI plays a major role:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enhanced Risk Management and Resilience&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Strategic Decision-Making and Optimization&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automation and Productivity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data-Driven Supplier Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ultimately, Donovan's discussions show that AI is not just about efficiency; it's about giving procurement leaders the intelligence and agility they need to thrive in a world full of interconnected risks. The real power of AI lies in its ability to transform procurement into a function that can anticipate and respond to change, rather than simply reacting to it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We have the McKinsey's 2024-2025 research which supports these conversations.&amp;nbsp; AI is set to drive and redefine how the procurement operates, arrive at decisions and deliver value in an Organization. Their findings show that organizations where AI has been adopted early, they are seeing:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Up to 30% faster sourcing cycles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;5–10% reductions in spend&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Over 20% improvements in contract compliance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Significant reduction in manual exception handling&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These Research also identifies four important areas where adopting AI can make a major impact:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Spend analysis and bundling strategies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supplier performance evaluation and ESG monitoring&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Automated RFP creation and negotiation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reducing value leakage across the Source-to-Pay cycle&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Source (&lt;A href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/revolutionizing-procurement-leveraging-data-and-ai-for-strategic-advantage" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/revolutionizing-procurement-leveraging-data-and-ai-for-strategic-advantage&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/where-is-procurement-heading-in-the-next-ten-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/where-is-procurement-heading-in-the-next-ten-years&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/procurement-2025-reimagining-the-function-for-success" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/procurement-2025-reimagining-the-function-for-success&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Ariba's embedded capabilities align closely with these areas, and it goes beyond when supported by SAP Joule and the Business AI Accelerator Service in Preferred Success.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Where AI Is Already Delivering Value in SAP Ariba&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Ariba was already into the AI Journey before generative AI became the focus in the technology world. The Solution was enabling meaningful automation through traditional Machine Learning AI. The functionalities are already live and in use today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Guided Sourcing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Smart Event Creation&lt;/STRONG&gt; helps sourcing leads get started faster by recommending event templates based on historical data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supplier Recommendations&lt;/STRONG&gt; suggest relevant, qualified suppliers using profile matching and past performance insights&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The result: shorter sourcing cycles, better supplier outcomes, and more informed decisions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Guided Buying&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Personalized Product Recommendations&lt;/STRONG&gt; surface the most relevant items for each user based on behaviors and role&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Catalog Item Matching&lt;/STRONG&gt; offers compliant alternatives when users search for off-catalog or non-preferred items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The result: increased compliance, reduced maverick spend, and a better buying experience overall.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These use cases represent just a portion of what’s possible.
