    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1658565480"&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Introducing the State of the Art&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The current state of virtualization of real-world processes in different industries is characterized by domain-specific solutions, single-siloed approaches and therefore shows a splintered and fragmented landscape across domains. Although virtualization is used everywhere but not harmonized, the discussion of actual technologies and the value of holistic integration of those virtualization technologies into a future generation of Digital Twins is intended to boost the application of those Digital Twins and is therefore considered to be key to real value generation. Diverging streams of activity in research, industrial trends and standardization efforts result in slow adoption. Those diverging streams lead to a higher perceived risk for today’s offerings as well as fear of missing out on future offerings and with that ultimately to slower adoption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The outlined hypothesis here is that autonomy needs to reach a threshold level together with a harmonized approach of integration and autonomy to provide real value to process optimization. Key objectives are the meta structure of a holistic digital twin and the achievable improvements by integration for several realistic industrial scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not within scope of this paper are the implications of this concept for the technologies and applications relevant for the holistic digital twin. Further analysis will be required to understand the impact on runtime environments, platforms, and networks. We address the actual situation by taking different viewpoints on the topic and further identify the challenges with the traditional approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1591134694"&gt;a.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Digital Twins and their interaction with other functional elements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;How do elements of a future digital twin concept support today relevant functionalities of control and interaction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The article examines the combination and application of AI, Generative AI, and Digital Twins in the context of process management. It specifically focuses on the development of Agentic AI components and the "Data as a Product" philosophy. Figure 1 illustrates the current state: AI as well as generative AI, and digital twin technologies coexist and operate side-by-side without true integration and orchestration, which is the starting point of our evaluation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arminpue_9-1767625258110.png" style="width: 737px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358215i54EB21E069FA35F0/image-dimensions/737x232/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="737" height="232" role="button" title="arminpue_9-1767625258110.png" alt="arminpue_9-1767625258110.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 1 AI, GenAI, and Digital Twin components&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Agentic AI and human collaboration&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agentic AI enabled software sees the start of early market introduction according to Gardner&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;[1]&lt;/SPAN&gt; and other sources.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Topics of human and agent collaboration like control, interaction, and directives are addressed by research as well as software industry to focus on specific value creation and to fulfill requirements by the EU AI Act. (see [14])&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We understand that research postulates (see [8]) the active digital twin empowered by agentic technologies. This can be considered as important first step to reach a much higher level of functionality for Digital Twins.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1394621189"&gt;b.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Digital Twins and their semantic descriptions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Publications are available to describe the general concepts of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), its different types, and their implications&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;[2]&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Platform Industry 4.0&amp;nbsp;[3] had started the development and standardization efforts many years ago and has initiated and accompanied the foundation of the Industrial Digital Twin Association [4] as user organization to execute standardization in international organizations (e.g., International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)) as well as to promote the technology in different industries. Resulting from this work, the AAS has been included in the IEC series of&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Promoting Digital Twin technology by software companies and by automation industry is closely related to driving internal standardization. This is motivated by enablement of common semantics and effective information exchange between applications within their respective portfolio. Those industry driven custom standards are vendor specific, for internal use only, and seldom accessible via public interfaces (see [15] in example).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Developments in research focus more on how to extend the capabilities of Digital Twins. Data integration, real-time analytics, interoperability and artificial intelligence are the key words here. Standardization is not a real focus of academic research.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As of today, we see an unbalanced approach between academic and industry. The limited cooperation focuses mainly on cooperation in publicly funded projects and organizations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Additionally, we see regionally different approaches in research: While research in North America is targeted at the full simulation of the physical object, there is a strong focus on semantics and standardization in Europe (see [15] which highlights the use case perspective of digital twin technology vs. [3] and [4] which focus on providing public standards and motivate to apply those standards to the portfolio of asset providers).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This leaves the supplier and operator sides in manufacturing with open questions: How to create the required Digital Twins? Do we make them or buy them? How to create tangible value by implementing and using them?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In favor of all said above, the market size for Digital Twins is estimated to reach USD 110.1 billion by 2028 with at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61.3%&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;[5]&lt;/SPAN&gt;. So there is enough reason to act now and drive the evolution of Digital Twins to create real industrial manufacturing benefits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1198107684"&gt;c.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Industrial processes&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and Digital Twins&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Process optimization is mainly referred to as IT-supported optimization of business processes. But what about technical processes which are fundamental that is, part of the core process of manufacturing, and are optimized with engineering- and maintenance-based applications and tools?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These two types of processes have not yet been considered in the same context. Namely, how can a Digital Twin optimize across business and technical processes?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We see value in having a more aligned approach between these two types.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Business Processes&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business Process Management (BPM) supports digital transformation in a static manner and provides expertise on existing process landscapes. Adaption and optimizing business processes is up to now a human or “manual” task and with limited focus on new or emerging technologies where efficiency is driving the product roadmap rather than innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agentic optimization of business processes is rather a research related task with first commercial initiatives in the open-source community [5], [6].&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Technical Processes&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technical processes are governed and maintained by process engineering with limited IT support and more human based experiences and skill sets.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The technical process contains process descriptions like BPM but in addition requires specific recipes, quality management guidelines, and regulations. Representation of those additional information is well understood by research and proven and well-established (e.g., by Colored Petri Nets (CPN), Systems Theory etc.).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1001594179"&gt;d.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Challenges&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for virtualization with Digital Twins &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, the separated approach to those different process types above result in low adoption and lead to major roadblocks in intercompany collaboration or, in the best case, to adapting Digital Twin technology only for the main product strategies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Local adoption, that is in manufacturing, might lead to local optima and might only push any bottleneck further down the process chain. In addition, Digital Twin technology so far has no importance in the context of digital transformation, which is primarily seen as a predictive and deterministic exercise on value chains. But these value chains are more and more based on processes which cross the borders of a single corporation and require a networked implementation in between companies - internally for cooperations and externally for business networks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The financial view of Digital Twins represents the asset as a capital expenditure (CAPEX) object in financial reporting and the respective financial platform. This is still an isolated topic and not considered in the context of process optimization, but assets need to be integrated with their financial representation as well, in order to represent a holistic view of the full business value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In summary, current Digital Twin initiatives are fragmented on one side across domains (technical vs. business processes) and on the other side fragmented between research vs. industry vs. standardization efforts, leading to slow adoption and suboptimal value generation. This underlines the need for a holistic integration,which we address next.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-675997955"&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Proposed Holistic Digital Twin Framework&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;To address the lack of integration between business and technical processes, the HDT combines both process types in a single model. To enable autonomy, which will address the need for a certain threshold of autonomy mentioned earlier, we incorporate Agentic AI components. To deal with semantic interoperability issues, we leverage the Asset Administration Shell standard within the HDT for common data descriptions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, we present here a generalized model of a next-generation holistic Digital Twin system, which addresses the open gaps and challenges outlined before. This model shall describe Digital Twins relevant for technical as well as business processes. This model is then validated in several real-worlds scenarios from different industries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We follow a conceptual approach by first defining the principles of an HDT Architecture, then evaluating this approach against three distinct real-world scenarios taken from the fields of manufacturing, pharmaceutical production and inter-company business networks, in order to illustrate its applicability and benefits. Here we identify the desired achievements with this conceptual approach. The Holistic Digital Twin (HDT) system is based on paradigms and will need further innovation on topics we will clarify here.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The holistic paradigm&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We talk about something being “holistic”, if the elements are designed in such a way that the total collection will be able to exceed the individual performances of the respective elements of the entire collection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The next generation of Digital Twins are Holistic Digital Twins (HDTs), which include data, control, sensors, and actuators and therefore will be able to generate intelligence &lt;EM&gt;and&lt;/EM&gt; behavior within a defined scenario.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The self-similarity paradigm&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The HDT composes system elements which exposes three characteristics: asset, capability, and replication and are self-similar with respect to these three characteristics. Self-similarity will lead us to less hierarchical technical systems, as they will turn into heterarchical&lt;A href="#_ftn4" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[4]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; systems with higher adaptability and autonomy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-608567169"&gt;a.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Components and structure&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We outline the major components and elements involved in this conceptual approach and highlight the interaction and collaboration with external elements of the software landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Being self-similar requires covering three elements:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The description of the asset&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The description of its capabilities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The description of the capability to replicate this very asset&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These elements characterize a Digital Twin of the next or second generation. The actual technology for Digital Twins is always based on physical assets which are connected to a virtual description. The next generation of Digital Twins will have the capability to exist without a physical asset and can generate physical assets based on their inherent descriptions and capabilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It deemed important to outline that the HDT as representative of a 2nd generation of digital twins provides capabilities to generate a 3rd generation of digital twins, where autonomy and interaction between 3rd generation twins create autonomous behaviour of a swarm representing many digital twins.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arminpue_10-1767625387832.png" style="width: 547px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358216i44563287AC6E26E5/image-dimensions/547x224/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="547" height="224" role="button" title="arminpue_10-1767625387832.png" alt="arminpue_10-1767625387832.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 2 The next generations of Digital Twins&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Holistic Digital Twin (HDT) as outlined here represents the second generation for following reasons:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The term process here also includes technical processes. Therefore, a plant HDT can produce a product HDT.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The capabilities generate such replication based on self-similarity. A production plant consists of assets and process descriptions. The resulting asset “product” itself consists of the asset description as well as the complete description how to produce it.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Production systems consist of products which in turn are produced on other production systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This picture illustrates why it is important to understand technical and business processes both as processes and describe them in same methodology of self-similarity) (see Figure 3 Self-similarity of assets as requirement for self-replication.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arminpue_11-1767625450422.png" style="width: 578px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358217i7DA40CA8F749DDFC/image-dimensions/578x237/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="578" height="237" role="button" title="arminpue_11-1767625450422.png" alt="arminpue_11-1767625450422.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 3 Self-similarity of assets as requirement for self-replication&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A real holistic system evolves when all key capabilities are bundled, are identified as one object, and can communicate amongst each other with focus on their domain of interest. Therefore, we suggest a Holistic Digital Twin Framework as outlined in the next chapters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arminpue_12-1767625555805.png" style="width: 656px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358218iD420EC9B2D6FFB8D/image-dimensions/656x471/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="656" height="471" role="button" title="arminpue_12-1767625555805.png" alt="arminpue_12-1767625555805.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 4 : A Holistic Digital Twin (HDT) – Architecture showing the core components of the HDT (e.g., User Interface, AI Engine, Data Integration, Process Management)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;User Interaction and Interfaces&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Visibility into the HDT must be ensured to understand workflow and actions inside of the HDT, implemented by using dashboards. Control of the HDT is a must to secure against misuse, understand hallucination and bias, and prevent wrong outcomes. Control is tightly connected to the security and governance layer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;API-encapsulted capabilities implement two different scopes. One scope deals with access to tool landscapes which are important to enable the HDT to act within a given frame and to invoke applications. The other scope deals with standard API functionality which enables the HDT to interact within the IT landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Digital Twin Core&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data models deal with the traditional efforts of semantic standardization. The Industry 4.0 Platform initiated the development of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as semantic standard which is maintained by the International Digital Twin Association (IDTA) (see [2]and [4]). Important are also custom specific semantic standards which are defined, often as proprietary standard, by individual companies. A discussion of standardization is contained in chapter 4.b below as one of the main drivers for market penetration with Digital Twin technology.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Simulation models are at the core of generative AI and allow to affect future actions of the HDT based on learning and prediction. Results are stored in dedicated and persistent storage of the HDT.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Both data and simulation model work hand in hand. Data models extend the accessible data foundation and simulation models improve the quality of data models.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The synchronization engine is essential to handle the different elements of technical process descriptions, which range from formalized elements like process notations or recipes to informal elements like GXP. Those regulations are defined by different national and international regulation bodies, where we refer to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA (&lt;A href="http://www.fda.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;www.fda.gov&lt;/A&gt;) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA, &lt;A href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/homepage&lt;/A&gt; )&amp;nbsp; for pharmaceutical processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Data Ingestion and Integration Layer&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any information about the real world and the informational world needs to be collected as raw data and passed through infrastructure like edge devices or edge software and finally distributed in middleware layers before the digital twin core can digest and execute this information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Important to mention is that this refers to a production environment where IoT data is key to understand the real world as well as to information technology where data contained in business applications is computed before transmitted to higher levels of the architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;AI and Analytics Engine&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Machine learning, Large Language Models (LLM), and decision logic provide the intelligence to perform the critical tasks of the HDT:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Break down a function into different tasks&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Analyze the available information&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Develop a solution strategy&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Learn from execution &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Support persistency to improve the function&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The degree of autonomy of the HDT and the communication via user interfaces are controlled here based on user regulations and rules.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Such alignment needs interaction between different elements of the HDT like the AI and Analytics Engine, the Synchronization Engine, and the Access Control of the Security and Governance Layer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Process Management and BPMN 2.0 Integration&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This element of the HDT is the second most important one (besides AI and Analytics Engine) as it interprets, harmonizes, and generates a common view on technical processes as well as business processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The capability to understand business process notations, to maintain a set of best practice processes, and to generate and communicate modified and new business processes is based on today’s standard notations with Business Process Management Notation (BPMN) 2.0 [12].&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The capability to describe technical processes needs to include the description of the asset itself, the processes related to this particular asset and the terms and regulations being relevant for the asset&lt;A href="#_ftn6" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[6]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further research needs to be done to define a common machine-readable semantic for both types of process descriptions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Access Control as part of the overall control of this Agentic-AI-driven HDT is required to ensure validated and protected data access. Access Control implements data policies and provides protection against hostile attacks towards the HDT.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Encryption is relevant to ensure data protection and secure transmission of information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Logging and Audits are important to prevent cybercrimes, support forensic analysis on ongoing or past attacks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The security and governance layer in its entirety suggests considering compliance and to be the foundation for implementation of AI ethics in accordance with the EU AI Act regulations. The focus needs to be the risk evaluation of the potential use of the HDT.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-412053664"&gt;b.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Expected Contributions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We identify here what contributions this approach will provide for the future architectural landscape of industries. We discuss its potential implications, applications, and how to further advance understanding and drive deployment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Integrated Value proposition &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We expect to contribute with value propositions on different levels or layers which are compiled in this &amp;nbsp;Figure 5 :&amp;nbsp; Integrated Value Proposition for Digital Twin Technology in Process Automation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Those layers are not necessarily architectural layers but individual topics being put in a holistic frame. All layers represent a value chain in itself and are based on core technologies. Layer 1 enables a data lifecycle which is enabled by the HDT holding the relevant data for each product. In Layer 2 cooperation between research and standardization bodies will be put on a new foundation by integrating the processes of real-world applications. On layer 3 autonomy will be introduced in a more safe manner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arminpue_13-1767625673246.png" style="width: 686px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358222i1440832FD55209E0/image-dimensions/686x504/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="686" height="504" role="button" title="arminpue_13-1767625673246.png" alt="arminpue_13-1767625673246.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 5 :&amp;nbsp; Integrated Value Proposition for Digital Twin Technology in Process Automation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Point of View – Autonomous behavior and human control&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Point of View - The balance between Research, standardization and real-world application.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The HDT conceptual approach of a Digital Twin has the capability to describe Digital Twins for all three initiatives. Find more in chapter 4.b with further explanations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Point of View – Data with a Product Lifecycle&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is mandatory to define a data foundation, where lifecycle management of the desired data products can be established. This is already provided today in concepts like data fabric, but the HDT will be able to really unfold the value of this foundation. This follows the holistic paradigm as described in chapter . Find more in 4.a with further explanations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Point of View – the Central Core: The Integration Model&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The holistic approach of HDT will drive the application of standardization efforts like AAS (or other related standards) as semantic standards by adding the Agentic AI capabilities and a rule-based system to achieve autonomy and supervision for the scenarios of operator-type customers in their industries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The meta-model of HDT encompasses also the internal standardizations of supplier-type companies, because the Large Language Models (LLM) as implementation of models allow to adapt to all kind of semantic standards.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Point of View – the Ethical Aspect: The European AI Act&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We consider here the ethical discussion in the light of how to provide or deploy in accordance with the EU AI Act.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fundamental for the EU AI Act is the risk assessment, where high-risk AI systems (HRAIS) need to be either excluded or clearly indicated as such by provider and deployer with obligations for both. The HDT is derived in its nature from an asset, which usage in the context of this paper is likely to be non-high risk related. Nevertheless, all elements marked as “Controlled Interaction” in the picture Automation serve the purpose of fulfilling requirements of risk management, transparency, documentation and human governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Autonomy of the HDT is a key differentiator from other software systems in accordance with the EU AI Act. Therefore, it must be controlled through user interaction (governance, transparency, and documentation).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In HDT, the intended usage as required by the EU AI ​​Act is virtually enforced through the risk assessment by embedding the AI ​​system and the analytics engine, since the entire HDT is not general purpose but serves to describe and create a specific asset (thus supporting well-defined risk management).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Redefined Modularity and Composability&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The HDT is basically a meta model to describe actual Digital Twin approaches. It exceeds actual state of the art with the holistic paradigm which collects and describes all relevant intelligence within the frame of HDT to fulfill a real-world scenario and redefines the concept of modularity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, the traditional horizontal approach in architecture design will be extended or even replaced by such meta model and a related composable architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-86457440"&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Impact to Process Automation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We summarize here the illustrative scenario analyses of our thought leadership approach. It is important to highlight that this is a theoretical evaluation of the concept. With reference to the industrial scenarios, we highlight how the Holistic Digital Twin concept improves our view on process optimization and open doors to the next generation of holistic digital twins. Highlighting significant conceptual patterns will be based on diverse point of views.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-19026654"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;a.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Application in real-world scenarios&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We will evaluate now the capabilities of an HDT based architecture in different industrial processes scenarios to illustrate its versatility and benefits&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Scenario - Modular production in manufacturing industries&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Main characteristics of modular production are similar or at best equal to production modules with a shift of intelligence from higher levels of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Maintenance Executions Systems (MES) into the production module itself. The term module applies to the actual manufacturing steps (cutting, welding, assembling, etc.) as well as to the enabling logistics components like Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV)&lt;A href="#_ftn7" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[7]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; or logistic controls. Manual reworks stations will follow this same principle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This definition of the term modular production is taken from a real implementation in 2024:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The organizational form of modular production is characterized by three central basic principles: decoupled stations, a self-organized production system and an integrated overall system. [6]&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On an abstraction level a modular production could look as in Figure &lt;STRONG&gt;6&lt;/STRONG&gt; : Automation components to implement a modular production . A characteristic is the the capability of each element to serve multiple purposes like producing or transporting a variance of different products. : This is combined with a clear separation between transport of material and manufacturing of material, all connected with the external production by inbound and outbound logistics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arminpue_14-1767625808298.png" style="width: 570px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358224iD9DC048851F82612/image-dimensions/570x328/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="570" height="328" role="button" title="arminpue_14-1767625808298.png" alt="arminpue_14-1767625808298.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 6 : Automation components to implement a modular production&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The main characteristic of modular production is to enable higher flexibility in variant production by balancing demand and capacity with decentralized intelligence on the involved modules.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are representing each of these modules as a HDT and will evaluate the advantages of HDT compared to the actual still centralized intelligence implemented by logistic control and by work order management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We anticipate the existence of one HDT for each of the elements in modular production like one HDT representing one of the modules and one of the AGVs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If we look at the processes required to execute this modular production we take for example the actual manufacturing-related processes, as described in Figure &lt;STRONG&gt;7&lt;/STRONG&gt; : Manufacturing Processes in Modular Production. Supporting processes are the manufacturing control, Quality Assurance and Control and Maintenance &amp;amp; Repair. These processes are suggested here to be executed by each module, which requires capabilities of autonomy and intelligence, which will be enabled by the HDT.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arminpue_15-1767625870647.png" style="width: 852px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358227iD3DD7CAEF4369712/image-dimensions/852x365/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="852" height="365" role="button" title="arminpue_15-1767625870647.png" alt="arminpue_15-1767625870647.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 7 : Manufacturing Processes in Modular Production&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some processes require execution by the matrix module, others require that the matrix module needs to contribute (with information), and for some processes the matrix module itself requires information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This will significantly reduce the complexity of supporting applications like MES and optimize usage of production system by improving white space management&lt;A href="#_ftn8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[8]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This will require multiplication of intelligence to the different Module x, but will reduce complexity since the concept requires the very same intelligence on all module x.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The same logic will be applied to the material transportation units AGV x.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, this approach allows the HDT embedded intelligence to predict the production capacities and provide a forecast on produced units per time unit. This is relevant as modular production is sometimes criticized for being behind linear production in capacity targets, although more advanced in adaptability to varying demands.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No central control system is required with an HDT based production planning, which reduces overall cost and increases flexibility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The value proposition of a HDT for a matrix module is positive only under the condition, that the HDT-Matrix Module can execute the indicated parts of the three business processes, manufacturing, quality assurance &amp;amp; control, and maintenance &amp;amp; repair. The guidance and orchestration of the Matrix Module is provided by the production planning &amp;amp; scheduling process. The key value proposition is the direct execution of sales orders, the real time-based Inventory and order management resulting in faster customer value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This scenario demonstrates how distributing intelligence via HDTs to each component like modules or AGVs can eliminate the need for central control efforts and reduce the overall complexity of the production system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Scenario - Low volume production &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The pharma production in life science industries tends to outsource production of active pharma ingredients (API) to Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMO) as third parties. This requires a gap analysis between the required technical processes to produce the API and the technical capabilities of the CDMO plant. This gap analysis includes technical solutions (processes like lithiations or cryogenic processing to mention a few) as well as chemistries (chemicals like acid chlorides, bromination, nitration etc.).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This gap analysis can be improved by HDTs which represents the APIs on one side by including also recipes and technical process requirements and on the other sides HDTs representing the capabilities of the production system owned by the CDMO and exemplarily shows self-similarity in real life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Self-similarity of HDTs is a pre-condition to efficiently execute this gap analysis. The HDTs shall be able to support the decision if a defined technical process can be executed on a given production asset and to maintain the information during the life cycle of product and production.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another benefit of the HDT framework here is that the pharmaceutical industry can also provide simulations about what would have happened if an intervention would not have happened (e.g., a process change would not have been implemented, or a medication would not have been taken); this might come in particularly handy to demonstrate progress/success if not easily visible (e.g., treatment that can’t cure an illness, only slow it down etc., so adherence to the therapy is crucial (e.g., Alzheimer)).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This matching of requirements to capabilities can up to now just be done as a manual work which depends on the knowledge of those doing it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The key door opener is the self-similarity paradigm which enforces on a meta level the one-to-one comparison of two different HDTs representing the product and the production system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Both are being compared on asset and on process level. This will drive efficiency in selecting CDMO for the major stake holders in pharmaceutical industries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This shows the power of the HDTs self-similarity paradigm in matching process requirements to production capabilities, a task that currently is manually executed and therefore often inefficient.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Scenario - Business network data exchange&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business becomes networked business between companies which is based on decentralized business networks, where control, decision-making, and resources across multiple participants is distributed rather than controlled by a single authority.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The exchange of data requires up to now a major implementation effort for participating companies regarding the topics of usage, transfer, validity, and ownership.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data as a self-explaining and self-authorizing data product can be implemented as a HDT. This HDT can be exchanged between decentral networks and contain all relevant processes to validate their usage. With data completely described via HDT, Data-as-an-Asset will help create real and transparent data marketplaces and overcome the asymmetric interest in data between data holders, data users etc&amp;nbsp;. (see [23]).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Interoperability between open industry specific data spaces is under development&lt;A href="#_ftn9" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[9]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; (see [27]). Those business networks are supported by external standardization efforts for semantics like the Asset Administration Shell (AAS). The critical topic for those decentralized networks is governance of such network. The data being exchanged between different network members contains so far just data, rules of usage and indications of ownership.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The critical question under discussion is the semantics of the data and the governance of the entire business network.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The HDT has the capability to exchange “Data as a Product“, where each of those products is represented as a HDT. The advantage is that no central governance of a network is required because the HDT provides governance all by itself. No business network is required anymore, as the HDT has the capability to carry with it all the necessary metadata, usage rules, and verification mechanisms.The holistic paradigm of the HDT allows the receiving business partner to evaluate the HDT represented data product and to evaluate its usage and fitness for purpose&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, the semantic standard being used with this “Data as a Product” is part of the capabilities descriptions. Understanding the content of the data product will be supported by all the efforts of external and internal standardization as described in the chapter Re-balancing standardization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since this scenario requires the clearest “Data as a Product” approach, we highlight in more detail how the HDT support this scenario.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arminpue_16-1767625934174.png" style="width: 744px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358229i772BF03EED681C0A/image-dimensions/744x329/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="744" height="329" role="button" title="arminpue_16-1767625934174.png" alt="arminpue_16-1767625934174.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 8 : The lifecycle of “Data as a product” in AI, Generative AI and Digital Twins Integration with a HDT&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We anticipate that the entire data lifecycle is covered from data creation, data curation and management to data packaging and distribution. All these steps are supported by HDTs through a semantic rule-based system which provides access to a common set of meta data and documentation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This scenario highlights the potential of HDTs to enable trust-worthy data sharing without a central broker, by encapsulating data and its governance within the Data-as-a-Product digital twin.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-169767506"&gt;b.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Re-balancing standardization&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standardization is a precondition for any interoperability of HDTs provided by the same or different suppliers. Therefore, this is relevant for all three considered real-world scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We see the different efforts on semantic standardization for Digital Twins of generation 1 being drifting apart on the supplier side as well as on the side of international standardization bodies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Major companies representing the supplier side are driving the Digital Twin technology by laying an internal semantic foundation to promote Digital Twin technology and accept these semantic standards and solutions only to be-used within their own portfolio.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;External standardization as common effort by many companies is organized by standardization bodies and organizations. They need to identify the common agreements on mainly semantic details and therefore will always be in such development behind the market requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These both streams of technological developments need to be in balance in order create real progress in digital process optimization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="arminpue_17-1767626011434.png" style="width: 639px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358230i6124DA234A2ED786/image-dimensions/639x294/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="639" height="294" role="button" title="arminpue_17-1767626011434.png" alt="arminpue_17-1767626011434.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 9 : Illustrative positioning of HDT in balancing research, standardization, and practical deployment&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This entanglement of internal standardization with external portfolio growth (in terms of market share) hinders the operator-side companies in driving their digital transformation based on a solid data foundation and intelligent use of AI technologies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The concept of the HDT as proposed here supports both types of standardization efforts by following a holistic and self-similarity-based approach. This is driving the development of both types of standardization and will push forward adoption of digital twin technology. Operator-side companies will benefit from this new approach of standardization by releasing the obstacles for their digital transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-266657008"&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;Conclusion and Outlook&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on the evaluation of the scenarios, we review the results in the context of actual ongoing developments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This paper introduces a concept for a next generation Holistic Digital Twin, which provides a meta-model to depict actual concepts for Digital Twins and open doors to new functionalities and business opportunities in virtualization. It also provides a solid base to enable environments and platforms for holistic – and autonomous – digital twins of second and third generation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Holistic Digital Twin model eliminates the conflict between semantic standardization and the impressing business potential for virtualization with Digital Twin technology. This will enable process optimization for networked inter-company as well as cross-company collaboration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Combining intelligence with information is the underlying idea of the HDT and makes the HDT independent and autonomous. This is in accordance with the holistic paradigm. Value creation of such strong capabilities happens by following self-similarity paradigm, which removes hindering separations between products, assets, and intellectual properties. Actual developments in the open-source community already show how to combine capabilities by crossing the border between different applications. Further subject of research will be how to implement and create the next generation of HDT´s to enable intelligent systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Within the scope of this article, we focused on the entire conceptual picture. Understanding how to adapt existing technologies and applications would provide valuable insights. Validation within prototypes and real-world scenarios will remain scope of future work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Future architectures will be built upon modular, autonomous, and agentic software, thus the Holistic Digital Twin will provide the optimal foundation for such software.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-70143503"&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;References&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[1]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; IEC 63278-1 ED1 project "Asset administration shell for industrial applications - Part 1: Administration shell structure"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[2]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; IEC TC65 WG24&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="#_ftnref3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[3]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; See &lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="#_ftnref4" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[4]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; Heterarchy describes a decentralized organizational model in which the various subunits of an organization are not in a relationship of superiority or subordination to one another but are largely equal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="#_ftnref5" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;[5]&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt; GxP is a collective term for a set of "good practice" guidelines and regulations used in the life sciences industry to ensure the quality and safety of products such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and food.

It has become the standard architecture for bringing enterprise data to Large Language Models (LLMs). The pattern is simple: chunk your documents, create vector embeddings, and perform a similarity search.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But as we move from "Proof of Concept" to production, we are hitting a ceiling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard Vector RAG is excellent at finding things that "sound like" your query (semantic similarity), but it struggles with &lt;STRONG&gt;structure&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;reasoning&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It can tell you that "Alice works at SAP," but it often fails at multi-hop questions like "Who works in the same department as the person who wrote the Q3 report?"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where &lt;STRONG&gt;GraphRAG&lt;/STRONG&gt; enters the picture. And the best part? If you are on SAP BTP, you already have one of the most powerful engines for this architecture: &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1394617345"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Limitations of "Flat" Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In a standard Vector Store, your data is essentially a pile of isolated chunks. When you search, you grab the top 5 chunks from the pile. You lose the context of how those chunks relate to one another.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This becomes even more critical when dealing with &lt;STRONG&gt;Multimodal Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Real-world enterprise documents aren't just text; they are PDFs containing diagrams, flowcharts, and architecture schematics. In a standard vector process, these images are often ignored or separated from the text that explains them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1198103840"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Solution: Hybrid GraphRAG&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The next evolution of AI on SAP BTP isn't about choosing between Vector Search or Knowledge Graphs. It is about using &lt;STRONG&gt;both&lt;/STRONG&gt;. I have been exploring a "Hybrid" approach where we use:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Vector Engine&lt;/STRONG&gt; (built into SAP HANA Cloud) for fuzzy, semantic search.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Graph Engine&lt;/STRONG&gt; (RDF/SPARQL in SAP HANA Cloud) for precise, structured relationships.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine SAP HANA Cloud as a "Super Librarian." It has a messy pile of fuzzy ideas (Vectors) and a neat corkboard of connected facts (The Knowledge Graph). To answer a complex business question, the system checks the fuzzy pile to understand the &lt;I&gt;intent&lt;/I&gt;, but validates the answer against the corkboard to ensure &lt;I&gt;factual accuracy&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1001590335"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multimodal RAG: Keeping Context Intact&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most exciting capabilities of this hybrid approach is handling mixed media.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_a8g428a8g428a8g4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358044i5A20DB269351B91F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Gemini_Generated_Image_a8g428a8g428a8g4.png" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_a8g428a8g428a8g4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When processing complex documentation (like technical manuals or financial reports), we can use the graph to create &lt;STRONG&gt;structural links&lt;/STRONG&gt;. We can index a diagram or an image not just by what is inside it, but by &lt;I&gt;where it sits in the document&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By modeling the document structure in the Knowledge Graph (e.g., &lt;CODE&gt;TextChunk A&lt;/CODE&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;CODE&gt;ADJACENT_TO&lt;/CODE&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;CODE&gt;Image B&lt;/CODE&gt;), we ensure that when an LLM retrieves the text explanation, it automatically pulls the relevant diagram along with it. This creates a true Multimodal RAG experience that "sees" the document the way a human does.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-805076830"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why SAP HANA Cloud?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Usually, building this architecture requires a complex stack: a vector database (like Pinecone), a graph database (like Neo4j), and a relational database to glue them together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP HANA Cloud is unique because it is truly &lt;STRONG&gt;multi-model &lt;/STRONG&gt;(yes it's also multimodal with this library). You can store your vectors, your RDF triples, and your relational metadata all in the same persistence layer. This simplifies the architecture immensely and reduces data movement, which is critical for enterprise security and latency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-608563325"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A New Framework for SAP Developers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To prove this concept, I have developed a TypeScript framework designed specifically for Node.js environments on SAP BTP. It acts as a bridge, orchestrating the interaction between the LLM (via LiteLLM) and SAP HANA Cloud’s dual engines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The framework handles:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Schema-Guided Extraction:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Using LLMs to turn unstructured text into clean Knowledge Graph entities (Nodes and Edges).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hybrid Retrieval:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Performing a vector search and then traversing the graph to find related context (including images).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Unified Storage:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Managing both the &lt;CODE&gt;REAL_VECTOR&lt;/CODE&gt; data and RDF Triples in a single connection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-412049820"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Learn More&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are interested in building the next generation of context-aware AI agents on SAP BTP, I invite you to read the full technical breakdown here (collaboration on the repo welcome!):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://medium.com/@techandfun/beyond-vectors-building-powerful-graph-rag-on-sap-btp-with-hana-cloud-50da841bb31f" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Read the full article on Medium: Beyond Vectors - Building Powerful Graph RAG on SAP BTP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s move beyond simple similarity search and start building AI that truly understands the structure of our enterprise data.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

We are going to focus on service scenarios in BTP Integraton Suite that also reach out to external carbon-based solutions, for example MuleSoft, Bomi, SnapLogic and Solace but also SAP BTP API Management, Advanced Event Mesh and SAP Integration Advisor&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This is a sort of &lt;STRONG&gt;"is what I have leaned over the years"&lt;/STRONG&gt; type of discussion, as opposed to having been produced just for the purposes of microscope slide making (or framework development).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In this blog series, I want to make some experiences available as developer since SAP XI/PI/PO/CPI longterm. Here are three I need to play with that should do the trick for the community devs to get their heads around:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Also, as an SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultant, I encourage you to dream big and express what you think. Once you have this deep understanding of what is possible with the SAP BTP Integration Suite, not only SAP CPI, you’ll be able to stand as equal with architects in a conversation and shape what that effective environment should look like.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let have this thrilling journey together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1591134760"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How I saw some Frankenstein architectures being born: three real cases&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In my long career, I have seen plenty of tools that offered to alleviate such complexity only to introduce complexity where none was warranted. One thing to keep in mind is that every tool or company, such as SAP, but also any other vendor has their pros and cons. But the benefits of normalizing these architectures are hard to ignore: less customization, better support, and more cohesive teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523703974"&gt;Case 1: Wasted Potential&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;When I started performing in this one “As sort of a fresh consultant with SAP BTP Integration Suite” working essentially as SAP PI/PO/CPI Consultant and my role was to glue the pieces i.e. boxes and mappings back again. I did not have the experience or courage to communicate my views back then, I believe that also led to suboptimal results. However, this was also a learning experience for the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The project was well-structured with explicit rules, standards, APIs and development models. Yet the external architects at the beginning of a migration to S/4HANA hadn’t considered implementations that already existed. … Even if SAP BTP (SAP Integration Suite – APIM and CPI) was there, they threw away this investment and capability on leveraging more strategic decisions and using the minimum as possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Consequently, no usage of the APIM was allowed at all and SAP CPI could only be classified as vanilla-prepackaged with as few adjustements. A second vendor took over the entire APIM infrastructure and bespoke integrations. The result was the undercutting of what had been a winning game plan.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1327190469"&gt;Case 2: Application of External Architecture Patterns&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In that case I was similarly unable to remember granular details about APIM and Events Management. The Iflow were my concern and here I spotted a considerable design issue, lets call it flaw: that the payload being kept in datastore is nothing more than an output of a mapping logic making it futile.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This was a “three layer design – Intelligence Layer, Processing/Routing Layer and the Delivery Layer” that was enforced on top of SAP CPI, which came from an entirely different area all together. To preserve this false structure, the solution became rather complex chain of hundreds JMS queues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1130676964"&gt;Case 3: Scattered teams and technologies&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;I am not going to discuss in depth about APIM and Events with other vendors. One organization did adopt BTP in piecemeal via Events/API but SAP CPI were the only service that came together and was used appropriately. Duties were separated into teams that didn't talk to each other. In the end, this lack of coordination resulted in higher costs and complexity – which is breaking the very synergy SAP BTP Integration Suite was designed for: SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-675998021"&gt;The Emergence Of “Frankenstein” Architectures And Why Decoupled Integration Does Not Succeed&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Organizations have the tendency to spend millions in SAP BTP without fully leveraging its strategic capabilities. But what we end up with is &lt;STRONG&gt;"Frankenstein Architectures"&lt;/STRONG&gt; – a collection of parts cut and sewn into a jumble of ill-formed systems. The linked parts may be powerful, but the ecosystem is inherently weak.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These are hardly ever genuine technical constraints. Rather, they emerge from:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Architectural Bigotry:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Choices created by management who don’t really understanding the SAP integration terrain.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lack of Trend Following:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Excessive focus on the latest buzzwords, without considering the merits of having a complete ecosystem.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Siloed communication:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; A gap between high-level architects and the developers working with SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;With SAP at the core of your backend, be it ECC or S/4HANA then BTP is something else altogether on a different level, and I mean because that’s where its roots are from. Despite the necessity of third-party integrations, there comes a point when the trade-off between “market-trending” external tools and native connectors actually incurs a technical debt that negates the end customer’s requirement for stability. Different systems can live together side by side, but nothing comes close to the level of integration offered in SAP world with SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767600837094.png" style="width: 862px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358079i07775F446E0FF613/image-dimensions/862x572/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="862" height="572" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767600837094.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767600837094.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 1: Frankenstein Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-479484516"&gt;The Trap of the “Legacy Mindset”: The Real Barrier to True Innovation&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Although we can critique tools, vendors and platforms till the cows come home, on some level our constraints are not technological at all. The greatest hindrance to a successful innovation experience is habit, accumulated over years of dependence on legacy systems. Such statements as “we won’t touch it, it’s working,” “the developer already is not with a project” and “there are no any docs” belong to the type that depends on stable but inflexible architecture. This leads to known experiences that do not evolve, led by a strong fear of the new.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;There are many that still operate under the paradigm of on-premise integration landscapes from a decade ago. This oldskool attitude results in a frustration tainted with fear of the new, or unfamiliar paradigms and perhaps more often than not, a mis-appreciation of what today's platforms are capable of.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;A real innovation requires to think differently. The question should not be “How do I generate this map?” a closer look: “Is this a map? Should it be an event? An API? Or whether it should exist at all in its current version?”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Without such a crucial change, old habits can die hard for companies looking more innocently to roll the past forward without realizing it is in danger of imposing historical limitations on new opportunities and tools. Thus, the result is not genuine modernization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-282971011"&gt;The Voice of the SAP Integration Suite Consultant: You’re the Strategic Bridge&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;A highly experience Integration Consultant—either in a senior role or that of an expert one—needs to have full knowledge of the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) integration suite Event Mesh (EM), Enterprise Assessment Management (EAM), API Management (APIM), Integration Assessment (IA) and Cloud Integration (CPI). But such technical proficiency is only the beginning. If you want to add value, then we need to do more than just drive “tickets” or be used as a “delivery“ service, not only SAP CPI developer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What you think about SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultant ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-86457506"&gt;Apart from SAP PO: Migration to SAP CPI or Migrating the Legacy (Snap Logic, Boomi, MuleSoft, Informatica, Microsoft etc.)&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;With middleware, many companies find themselves managing a hodgepodge of technologies. The 1,000 interfaces that need to be migrated from the likes of Snap Logic, MuleSoft, Informatica, Dell Boomi or webMethods to SAP BTP – SAP Integration Suite is not simply a question of technical mapping; it’s actually a functional exercise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Think of migration from SAP PI/PO to CPI. How many of you've seen flows with mapping layers having tons of UDF's, field-field mappings assigning to lots of standard functions (remove context, collapse context &amp;amp; rely on it), Conditional operators and Java mapping (as well) or Adapter module performing entirely different job.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;When dealing with such intricate mappings and modules, typically when you run the SAP Migration Assessment your migration status may be "non-migratable." Another point of consideration is that even if a&amp;nbsp; integration consultant has the skills to migrate these interfaces, do you really want them reverse engineering extracting prodcution payloads and manually testing for so long just to validate the results?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Furthermore, where is the documentation? Is the developer of this interface already gone?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Instead of looking at migration exclusively, it perhaps makes more sense to look rebuilding and examining the interfaces using native capabilities within SAP Integration Suite. Some of them could be transformed to events, others may become simple APIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;If the move from SAP PI/PO to SAP CPI is daunting, it’s even trickier when you have third-party interfaces in the mix. The details of such migrations can certainly complicate matters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_1-1767872347932.png" style="width: 863px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359363iA47D0ADBC315C97E/image-dimensions/863x574/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="863" height="574" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1767872347932.png" alt="rhviana_1-1767872347932.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 2: SAP Integration Consultants&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-19026720"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dismantling the Frankenstein Architecture in case of Multiples Platforms&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Int4 Suite (previously known as Int4 IFTT/Shield) is a test automation and service virtualization tool designed specifically for SAP ecosystems. It acts as an “accelerator” to dismantle the Frankenstein architecture and simplify complex migrations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767876653433.png" style="width: 852px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359417i8A394215EBA945BC/image-dimensions/852x564/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="852" height="564" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767876653433.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767876653433.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 3 – Dismantling the Frankenstein Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Functional regression is the biggest challenge when changing from SAP PI/PO to BTP. Testing convoluted, undocumented legacy mappings may appear to be testing hell—but it need not be.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Virtualization: Test Without Limits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Int4 Shield "feels" the behaviour of external systems from within APIM itself. And since this is possible, you guessed it also can we make against SAP BTP E2E full flows, even if the backend does not yet exist.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No More Reverse Engineering&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Quit spending weekends trying to decode obsolescent Java mappings, User Defined Functions (UDFs) with no documentation. Instead of building these factors by hand, Int4 Shield uses the Comparison Approach:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automated Extraction :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Securely captures real production messages to make a "test case repository."&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Parallel Execution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The old PI/PO mapping and the new BTP mapping are executed in parallel by this tool.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatic comparison:&lt;/STRONG&gt; for a penny or to the last character – Int4 shield checks each single difference and shows where logic diverges.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Massive Resource Savings&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The demand of manual testing is also greatly decreased by comparing with the real-world data as ground truth.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduce manual testing efforts up to 80%.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Test hundreds of scenarios in minutes, not weeks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Remove paperwork barriers: If the output matches, the logic works.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-169767572"&gt;Take apart the Frankenstein SAP PI/PO mappings and others&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The tool Figaf has these integration challenges in mind. The Figaf DevOps Suite, especially the Migration Edition, is built for the integration layer and has become the favored option when it comes to moving off SAP PI/PO and into the SAP Integration Suite (BTP).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;It is not a "generic" migration tool for all non-SAP external systems, like legacy databases and non-SAP ERP systems), but it supp (where integration flows connect those external systems with the SAP world).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767860556941.png" style="width: 834px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359268i158111B621741754/image-dimensions/834x542/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="834" height="542" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767860556941.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767860556941.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 4 - Figaf migration SAP PI/PO&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--26745933"&gt;Figaf: Focus and Capabilities&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figaf is a key component to DevOps and migration projects beyond the simple movement of code, as legacy logic is transformed into the modern Business Technology Platform (BTP) environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatic Migration&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The system automatically migrates PI/PO ICOs to iFlows, making the migration easy and allowing you to execute the migration flexibly with respect to architecture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Translation to Predicate Logic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Figaf skillfully converts complex Java and Mapping User-Defined Functions (UDFs) into Groovy scripts that adhere to BTP guidelines, so that legacy system functionalities are maintained in the transition to novel environments.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lifecycle Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: The set of tools consists of transport management, Git versioning and automatic documentation that covers the missing parts in the standard SAP BTP service.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Focus:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Figaf is designed for SAP PI/PO, the SAP Integration Suite (CPI) and API Management which provides a clear focus on integration problems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-70143569"&gt;RISE with SAP and Clean Core: Integration Must Not Be Forgotten&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;RISE with SAP is about more than transitioning to S/4HANA; it’s a fantastic time to eliminate historical sources of waste.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Classic Clean Core approach as it has been seen until now, for the most part only attacking the backend and identifying archived code that uses older ABAP "Z" code combined with customer modifications. This is necessary, but only a part of the meta-morphosis. Refining the backend result without the integration layer is a partial transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--419772943"&gt;Why "Clean Integration" Matters:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Suite as a Filter:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP BTP – which includes API Management, Event Mesh, Integration Advisor and Cloud Integration - is designed to keep your core stable. This suite helps put the ugliness in its place - far away from your backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Not Embracing the “Frankenstein” Anti-Pattern : Depending on miscellaneous external tools to enrich the inbuilt capability violates the ethos of a Clean Core. These are the sorts of practices that drive "borrowed architectures" which gradually acquire technical debt over time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to Future-Proof Your Systems:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A standard core demands a standard connection. If you don’t Integrate Clean, you’re likely just putting off big problems for another day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A Clean Core and a Messy Integration Layer cannot both exist. That’s crucial no matter how you currently are reevaluating 20 to 30 years of ECC custom code; it is just as necessary for the manner through which your systems will get linked.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_1-1767606669435.png" style="width: 802px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358119iD5533A3972D0A8F5/image-dimensions/802x534/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="802" height="534" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1767606669435.png" alt="rhviana_1-1767606669435.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 5 – Rise and Clean core backend plus Integration refactoring&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--616286448"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The intention of this post was to start a conversation between integration developers such as me. Note – this is not a discussion around the various other systems that help you run-the-business. Rather, my interest lies purely with the type of features that SAP BTP Integration Suite has relative to other industry-leading platforms in a similar space.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;I wanted to take a deeper look, with closer readers at trade-offs from within the space of API Management (APIM), Event Management (EM), Application Event Management (AEM), SAP Integration Advisor ( IA ) and Cloud Platform Integration (CPI).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This study is conducted to expand our knowledge and understanding of how overlapping functionalities should be addressed in a modern, homogeneous integration architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the end the decision is from the Integration Architecture responsable, because he must make all the checks between the plataforms and see what can be done with SAP BTP Integration Suite against others plataforms overlapping the services where you can focous in the homogeneos landscape with SAP BTP IS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Viana.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Accessing SAP Cloud Integration (SAP CI)&amp;nbsp;information programmatically has become quite common today.&lt;BR /&gt;Whether it’s iFlows, message processing logs, or deployed artifacts, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CI OData APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt; make this information easily available, all we need is &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;technical user&lt;/STRONG&gt; with the right roles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This convenience often raises a natural question:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2045868504"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Can we do the same for SAP BTP as well?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Can we programmatically access:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP BTP account details ?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Subaccounts and entitlements ?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Services and runtime information ?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The answer is &lt;STRONG&gt;Yes,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;but unlike SAP CI, the authentication and access model for &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Core Services&lt;/STRONG&gt; is fundamentally different.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1720272280"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why SAP BTP Is Different from SAP CI?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;When accessing &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CI OData APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, authentication is straightforward:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use an SAP CI technical user&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Assign the required roles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Call the OData endpoint&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, SAP BTP Core Services APIs (Accounts, Entitlements, Directories, etc.) do not work this way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;cannot&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use SAP CI technical users&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use basic authentication&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Directly call these APIs without a management service&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;SAP BTP protects these APIs using OAuth 2.0 and requires a dedicated management service to act as a trusted client.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;And this is exactly where the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Management Service (CIS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; comes into play.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523758775"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introducing SAP Cloud Management Service (CIS)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To access &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Core Services APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP mandates the use of: &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Management Service – CIS plan&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CIS acts as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;An authorized OAuth client&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A secure gateway to SAP BTP management APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The mechanism through which access tokens are issued for Core Services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once CIS is configured, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;can securely access SAP BTP Core Services APIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1327245270"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create SAP Cloud Management Service Instance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;BTP Cockpit --&amp;gt;

follow a different and more secure access model. These APIs are protected using OAuth 2.0 and require the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Management Service (CIS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; as the authorized gateway.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once CIS is configured, consuming SAP BTP Core Services APIs from SAP Cloud Integration becomes seamless, enabling automation, governance, and platform-level insights. Understanding this distinction is essential for designing robust and future-ready integration scenarios on SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cheers,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Punith&lt;/P&gt;</content>

No theory overload. Just usable guidance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’ll also look at familiar scenarios: converting SAP Analytics Cloud or SAP Datasphere customers, modernizing SAP BW, and positioning SAP BDC within SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition or the broader SAP Business Suite. The goal? &amp;nbsp;Help you move faster and sell with confidence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you work in sales, presales, or solution design, this session will save you time—and a few headaches—on your next deal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt; Register now and secure your spot.&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/education/psd/2025/jul/e_oe_te_w_PSD_WEB_00010688.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/education/psd/2025/jul/e_oe_te_w_PSD_WEB_00010688.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;#SAP #SAPBTP #SAPPartners #SAPBusinessDataCloud #SAPSales #SAPEcosystem&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Welcome to my second post in the series for ABAPers venturing into the wild world of BTP!&lt;BR /&gt;If you missed the first one, check it out here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/git-grit-giggle-and-no-rest-my-sap-learning-curve-with-bumps/ba-p/14270971" target="_blank"&gt;Git, Grit, Giggle and no REST: My SAP Learning Curve (with Bumps!)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you’re learning something new, teachers (or native speakers) love to say:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“Don’t use translations when learning a language”&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;“Don’t rely on stickers to learn piano notes”&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Easy for them to say!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When I started learning a second language, I translated everything — and it helped me big time. Now, after years of practice, I don’t need it anymore, and yes, I agree translation isn’t ideal. But that’s now, after years of fluency (and since my second language is English, feel free to judge me).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then I started learning piano… and guess what? I cannot do it without stickers. They guide me, make things easier, and slowly my brain gets used to not needing them. Imagine hearing a sound and magically knowing where you are when you just started? Laughable! It comes with time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So yes, I think of BTP like ABAP. Sue me! I make silly analogies — baking cakes for new technology, comparing tools to houses it helps me SO MUCH. And I’m here to share them with you, in case your brain works like mine. Tip: I always ask AI to give me analogies when I can’t understand something.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-container"&gt;&lt;a class="lia-spoiler-link" href="#" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;noscript&gt; (Highlight to read)&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-border"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-content"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/STRONG&gt; So far, I’ve only used a bit of BTP and created a foreground app. This post won’t cover everything, just the key concepts that matter to me so far.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-container"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-content"&gt;DISCLAIMER: So far, I’ve only used a bit of BTP and created a foreground app. This post won’t cover everything, just the key concepts that matter to me so far.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s start with the analogies and new tools!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1787710912"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BTP World in House Terms&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;TABLE width="929px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tool&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is it?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Think of it as…&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new world&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of BTP as the entire infrastructure of a city. Roads, electricity, water — everything that makes life possible. It’s not just one thing; it’s the platform where all your services, connectivity, and solutions live. Without BTP, nothing else exists. It’s the foundation of your new cloud life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BAS&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your new home&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where you’ll spend most of your time. BAS (Business Application Studio) is your cozy new home for development. It comes with tools, templates, and wizards that &lt;EM&gt;pretend&lt;/EM&gt; to make life easier (spoiler: they will, but not on day one). At first, you’ll feel like you moved into a smart home with lots of buttons and no manual.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Eclipse&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your old house&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The old house you still visit because you haven’t fully moved yet. It’s familiar, it works, but it’s not cloud-connected and definitely not the future. You’ll keep it around for a while, like that old sofa you can’t throw away yet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Approuter&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Gate and Reception&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine a fancy gated community. Approuter is the gatekeeper, &amp;nbsp;it welcomes guests, checks their identity, and directs them to the right place. No unauthorized visitors allowed. It’s all about routing and security.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;XSUAA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Security system&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of XSUAA as your smart alarm system. It makes sure strangers don’t get in and your house stays safe. Authentication and authorization? That’s its job.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HTML5 App&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The living room&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where the family gathers. Your users will spend time here, interacting with the app in harmony (hopefully). It’s the visible part of your home — the UI that everyone sees.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The kitchen&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’re Latin, you know the kitchen is the heart of the house. It’s where the magic happens — the backend logic, the database connections, the heavy lifting. Guests don’t see the mess; they just enjoy the delicious food (your app’s features). CAP is that kitchen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MTAR file&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The moving truck&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you move houses, you need a truck to carry everything. MTAR is that truck. It bundles all parts of your app and delivers them to the new place so users can consume it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;RAP app&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The futuristic building&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Picture a modern glass building with IoT gadgets everywhere — that’s RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming Model). It’s sleek, cloud-ready, and the future of ABAP development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1591197407"&gt;And now the ABAP analogies&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;TABLE width="921px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tool&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is it?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;In ABAP or analogy&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;MVC&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Model&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;View&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Controller&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Models – In BTP, this is your data layer. In ABAP, think internal tables and SELECT statements — the place where data lives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;View – Easy — the screen. Dynpro, ALV, or even a SmartForm. What the user sees.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Controller – The logic that glues it all together. In ABAP reports, that’s your event blocks like START-OF-SELECTION and END-OF-SELECTION. In OO ABAP, it’s your methods orchestrating the flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Manifest.json&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The route&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This file is the brain of your app. It tells where to go, when, and how.&lt;BR /&gt;In ABAP terms? Think of the master program in a Function Group — the one that knows all the paths and controls the flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;CSS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Styles&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP doesn’t really have CSS (oh, the UX pain we’ve endured!). The closest thing? Smart Styles in SmartForms but easier.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;I18N&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Translation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;In BTP, I18N handles translations. In ABAP, that’s like text elements or the language-dependent texts you maintain for reports and screens.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Package.json&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;List of dependencies&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This file lists all the libraries and modules your app needs.&lt;BR /&gt;In ABAP, the closest analogy is the where-used list or even the package structure that shows dependencies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;YAML&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Destination&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;YAML files define destinations and connectivity in BTP.&lt;BR /&gt;In ABAP, think RFC destinations in SM59 — the way you tell the system where to connect.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;GitHub and GitLab&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Versioning&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;In ABAP, that’s like transport requests. And if you use CHARM? Even better — Git feels like CHARM on steroids. You commit (save), push (release)…&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’re an ABAPer stepping into BTP, I hope these analogies make things a little less scary and a lot more fun. They work for me because my brain loves shortcuts and silly comparisons — maybe yours does too.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Of course, this is just scratching the surface. It’s only the beginning of the journey. I’m still learning. I will get there, someway, somehow. I hope!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since I am learning I would love your feedback! Did I get it right? Anything to add or change? Drop your thoughts in the comments — let’s make this cloud adventure easier together!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Let's take a quick look through the highlights. But before we do, let's check out the new FEATURE STATUS BADGES that are appearing more and more - in fact, there are a few in the notes for this release.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As we all know our Greek alphabet, we can correctly surmise that while BETA features are post-experimental and still possibly subject to change ... GAMMA features, not to be confused with the type of radiation that created The Incredible Hulk, are pretty much finalised and ready to use &amp;amp; test thoroughly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;00;44;22 - 00;01;19;15&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Two such features that are at GAMMA level in this release are Status-Transition Flows and Declarative Constraints.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;We covered Status-Transition Flows in a previous news item for the previous release, and there's an overview in this blog post we have for you.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;So let's instead take a brief look at the super exciting Declarative Constraints. There are new possibilities with the @assert annotation to define complex constraints, in your CDS model.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;01;19;18 - 00;01;50;01&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That's right, declaratively. We should always strive to PUSH outwards, pushing logic up into the declarative model, and queries &amp;amp; data manipulation down to the database, which goes hand in hand with CAP’s axiom WHAT NOT HOW.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The conditions are expressed in another domain specific language in CDS - CXL - CDS Expression Language.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;01;50;01 - 00;02;19;07&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And, almost as if we'd planned it, there’s a new Hands-on SAP Dev live stream series on CXL starting Friday next week, with me and one of the fab members of the CAP compiler team, Patrice. Don't miss it!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;CAP’s support for hierarchical tree views has just become a lot more streamlined, with a new @hierarchy annotation replacing a ton of OData specific ones.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;02;19;08 - 00;02;46;26&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now that's what I call simple reuse, and cap is an incredibly important idea and a best practice to add in that context. There's a new command CDS export, with which you can create API client packages from your CDS service. Definitions. The output is a full featured cap reuse package that can be published to and pulled from npm registries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;02;46;29 - 00;03;15;23&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now that’s what I call simple.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Reuse in CAP is an incredibly important idea, and best practice too, and in that context, there’s a new command cds export with which you can create API client packages from your CDS service definitions; the output is a full-featured CAP reuse package that can be published to and pulled from NPM registries. If exporting via EDMX is the lossy MP3 audio format, then cds export gives us a lossless transfer, more like FLAC.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By the way, if you're interested to learn more about reuse in CAP, with NPM packages, we've a new blog post series Modules, modularity &amp;amp; reuse in CDS models which you might be interested in, with parts 1 and 2 already published.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;03;15;26 - 00;03;45;29&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the CDS Language &amp;amp; Compiler topic, there's an enhancement that will appeal to those of you who develop and serve multiple frontends from the app/ directory. Now CDS file content from all ./app/* subdirectories will be fetched and loaded (say, with cds build or cds serve) instead of just from the app/ directory itself. This means we don't have to use an index.cds file in the app/ directory to import what we need.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;03;46;01 - 00;04;19;26&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Staying in the CDS Language &amp;amp; Compiler area, there's another enhancement that allows us to use symbols not only for enums defined in CDS, but now also for enums in OData annotations. The example in the release notes in Capire is great, because not only does it illustrate the enhancement, but it also causes the curious amongst us to use our brains and go to find out where the relation between 1 and Readonly, and between 7 and Mandatory, is defined.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;04;19;26 - 00;04;51;01&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And of course it's in OData's “Common” vocabulary, contributed by SAP.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the Node.js runtime topic, it is now possible to make direct CRUD requests on draft-enabled entities; for example, instead of the EDIT-PATCH-SAVE sequence, you can now just send a direct UPDATE request.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Also, event queue processing has been consolidated into a default queue ... and custom queues, and there has been a change to the db-related guarantee, from ‘at least once’ to ‘exactly once’.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;04;51;01 - 00;05;23;03&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Related guarantee from at least once to exactly once. Finally, in the NodeJS runtime topic, there has been some cleanup of the model reflection APIs. Some function uses have been deprecated and the text entities are now available in a text property of the corresponding localized entity. Moving to the Java runtime topic, there are some important changes related to deep updates for draft enabled entities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;05;23;06 - 00;05;52;09&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally in the Node.js runtime topic, there has been some clean up of the model reflection APIs. Some function usages have been deprecated, and the .texts entities are now available in a texts property of the corresponding localised entity.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the Java runtime, there are some important changes related to deep updates for draft-enabled entities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;05;52;11 - 00;06;23;25&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, as well as support for active entities, there’s also deep update support for inactive entities too, as long as the keys are included.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Additionally, there’s a new as(String alias) method on the CqnValue interface; with that, it’s possible to create aliased values directly, making it easier to build queries with aliased values.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the Tools topic, there’s a Kyma convenience now for the cds up command; if your project contains Helm deployment resources, and no mta.yaml file, then you don't need to specify the --to k8s option explicitly any more.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;And last but not least, in the Plugins topic, the Node.js plugin &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1862993"&gt;@SAP&lt;/a&gt;/cds-rfc now supports multitenancy.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There are links to everything I've mentioned, and more ... in the description.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;06;23;27 - 00;06;45;04&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post, Simona reflects on how 2025 laid the groundwork for AI powered ABAP development and gives us a clear line of sight into where things are going in 2026. One big highlight from the blogpost is that Joule for developers will remain free for another year, giving us more time to explore AI assisted coding in real projects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;06;45;07 - 00;07;15;00&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The blog post walks us through the evolution of AI last year and what's to come. Smart tooling with the AI workflow, deeper integration with VS code, and a renowned focus on custom code migration using AI, all designed to help developers be more productive and modernize their code bases. And that's really the strategy going into 2020. Shipping early, scaling smart, and keeping the ABAP core clean in 2025 is about unlocking what I can do.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;07;15;07 - 00;07;22;12&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then 2026 will make ABAP AI the core of AI about development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;07;22;15 - 00;07;54;05&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Q4 2025 release of SAP HANA Cloud brings many updates designed to streamline your workflow and unlock new possibilities. Let’s dive into what’s new.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Let's start with SAP HANA Cloud Central, which now supports background processing for long-running SQL statements that continue even after closing your browser. A new consolidated view of HDI schemas and containers provides quick access to HDI artifacts and their metadata.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;07;54;08 - 00;08;36;26&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business Data Cloud integration is streamlined—data products are automatically exposed as virtual tables, reducing manual setup and accelerating data reuse.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Calculation view modeling adds column lineage via SQL table functions, dynamic input parameters for MDS cube conversions, and runtime-evaluated restricted columns. Joins are enhanced with support for left outer joins in star joins.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This release introduces the ability to transform property graphs into semantic knowledge graphs without requiring redesign of data models, enabling flexible switching between paradigms on the same data for your use cases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;08;36;28 - 00;09;10;09&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For developers and data scientists, AI and machine learning capabilities have undergone significant enhancements. The new Unified Time Series procedure provides a consistent interface across algorithms, simplifying development. Text embedding models have been improved to reduce output dimensions without sacrificing accuracy, and the new cross and convert model. In an NLP service ensures more precise search results. Ranking with the Hana Experiment Monitor user interface.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;09;10;11 - 00;09;34;05&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The final SAP CodeJam of 2025 took place in Istanbul, with a focus on AI in SAP HANA Cloud. The next one will happen in February in Berlin, and rest assured, it will be updated with some of these cool new enhancements. You can request this CodeJam topic in your location also!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;09;34;08 - 00;09;38;22&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also see all the.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;09;38;25 - 00;10;08;14&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why not start the year off right? With the cleanest, safest applications you can. That's what the new application vulnerability report service for on SAP. BTP focuses on Cloud Foundry applications. Is exactly for this new service. Now in beta will allow you to scan your running applications on SAP, BTP on a regular basis and look for critical vulnerabilities. Don't wait until something happens to one of your applications to find out that there's a vulnerability in it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;10;08;16 - 00;10;31;19&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Be proactive and find out in advance. So I encourage you to check out this brand new service. I'll put the link to the blog post that describes it, as well as goes through the setup process. It's very easy to use and you can start getting your reports today, so I would encourage you to do so.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;10;31;22 - 00;11;00;19&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So my bedroom. So I hear that there were the two of us and have got a special leftovers right, to work with the community that long. You know what you want, right? Nope. There was kind of a learning journey that you did. Yeah. Our bosses always incentive us to look forward. And WhatsApp has to offer. Even if we don't do work on it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;11;00;21 - 00;11;22;13&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's not right. But if you know it, and that exists once the opportunity arrives, you already know it, then you can hit the ground running. Yeah. That's fantastic. So basically, as part of this learning journey, studying your cell phone, it's a party that you took part in. Definitely. Yeah. So what was your favorite aspect of that for week?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;11;22;15 - 00;11;52;13&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yeah. I think, seeing the videos, making the quizzes, I was amazed with Joe. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. That's really cool. So did you manage to attend any of the videos live, or are you watching? Sort of, recording? Nope. I had done both. That's dedication. That's real dedication. The journey was only, to learn. We have, a few months just learning and doing things.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;11;52;15 - 00;12;18;14&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yeah. Yeah. But in terms of, you know, what? What motivates you to keep doing. What is it? What's the secret? I think I'm a person that really wants to know more every time and keep searching and work for we can do. And, how can we automate our work? The aims, I think the I think it was all about that shit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;12;18;15 - 00;12;31;06&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oh, yeah. Yeah. How can we make our develop life better? Easier? And also curiosity driving. We got to learn. That's why I think that's the best definition of what developed. Yeah. Pedro, thanks very much. Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

But here’s the reality.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;if they don’t work together, your architecture is going to break sooner or later.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Growth is uncomfortable, moving away from just "configure adapters, fixing errors and create mappings" to actually thinking about strategy is tough, but you have to do it if you don't want to get stuck in the "trap" mindset.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Carl Jung once said: “Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakens.”&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the world of SAP BTP Integration Suite, if you only look at the "outside" - All they perceive is an illusion of integration you are merely dreaming of a perfect integration, but that dream won't survive longer with the digital integration transformation to truly &lt;STRONG&gt;"awaken"&lt;/STRONG&gt; as an SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultants, you must look &lt;STRONG&gt;inside&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;at integrations and the components they join in a more profound level. This in-depth knowledge results in more consistent and less brittle integrations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523730816"&gt;The "General" vs. The "Soldier" (A quick story)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me show you a imaginare conversation conversation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The following dialogue illustrates a common situation in integration projects when API Management is treated as an afterthought instead of an architectural capability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767912334527.png" style="width: 183px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359548iA864F83C5F738CDA/image-dimensions/183x251/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="183" height="251" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767912334527.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767912334527.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We need to migrate 40 APIs from an old platform to SAP BTP APIM, after deep analyses of polices and others comparing with other vendors. we are good to go.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;How should we handle this ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_1-1767912334528.png" style="width: 209px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359549iE7FF3CA1096A18B4/image-dimensions/209x242/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="209" height="242" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1767912334528.png" alt="rhviana_1-1767912334528.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI Developer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Easy. I’ll just build the iFlows in CPI, set up the HTTPS endpoints, and maybe throw in some Basic Auth or OAuth inside the flow. If something fails, I’ll set up an email alert.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_2-1767912334529.png" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359550iB8BD7732D366185B/image-dimensions/200x275/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="200" height="275" role="button" title="rhviana_2-1767912334529.png" alt="rhviana_2-1767912334529.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Okay... but what if a partner starts spamming our endpoint with 10x more traffic by mistake?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is CPI going to tank that hit directly?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Who’s controlling the gate?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Response - (Awkward silence)&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_3-1767912334530.png" style="width: 220px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359551i974EDDB2B48B02E3/image-dimensions/220x272/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="220" height="272" role="button" title="rhviana_3-1767912334530.png" alt="rhviana_3-1767912334530.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP - Integration Suite Consultant&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Hold on. We are not trading URLs here; we need to position SAP APIM as the defense in depth. It is our immune defense.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We will control the rate limiting and security policy within APIM so no request will get into CPI if not satisfy our requirements.

In a clean integration setup, APIM helps control &lt;STRONG&gt;who can access APIs, how traffic is handled, and how contracts are defined&lt;/STRONG&gt;, protecting SAP CPI and backend systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Going beyond a CPI-only mindset does not mean changing your role overnight. It means &lt;STRONG&gt;understanding where each tool fits&lt;/STRONG&gt; and using the right capability for the right responsibility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP API Management is not about copying URLs from one platform to another. It is about &lt;STRONG&gt;setting clear boundaries&lt;/STRONG&gt; so SAP CPI can focus on integration logic, while APIM takes care of security and traffic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;STRONG&gt;Part II&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we will move to&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/sap-btp-is-how-to-become-a-sap-integration-suite-consultant-beyond-sap-cpi/ba-p/14303996" target="_self"&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;event-driven integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Viana.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-19053562"&gt;References to study&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--417011600"&gt;References links compilation:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/group.cp-apim-code-1.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Get Started with API Management&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/developing-with-sap-integration-suite" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Developing with SAP Integration Suite -

Today we are going to talk about&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)&lt;/STRONG&gt; using &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Event Mesh (EM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced Event Mesh (AEM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This is the first of four posts (the last one a summary because I will not explain SAP CPI, I'm expect that you know already), and we will navigate you through how to stop being “SAP CPI Developer” and become an SAP Integration Suite Consultant - "Generals".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Second we will start with&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Event Mesh (EM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced Event Mesh (AEM).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sun Tzu once said: "In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity."&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In our world, logistics is how we handle data flow. If you are simply connecting dots, you are creating disorder. But when you leverage the synergy of the entire Suite—especially the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp;Event Mesh (EM/AEM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;—you finally bring order to the chaos or stantard events or custom events over the event-driven architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1720281121"&gt;The "General" vs. The "Soldier" (A quick story)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me show you a imaginare conversation conversation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The following dialogue illustrates a common situation in integration projects when SAP BTP EM/AEM is treated as an afterthought instead of an architectural capability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" style="width: 158px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359438iB6A2E203DD0429E3/image-dimensions/158x218/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="158" height="218" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our client is already using SAP standard events and custom events for others process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For critical processes, we can’t afford to lose messages or have the S/4HANA tied up during maintenance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We need a clean, resilient design.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How do we test this with SAP Event Mesh and SAP Advanced Event Mesh before moving to custom events?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767914540473.png" style="width: 193px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359556iF175B063638C8669/image-dimensions/193x232/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="193" height="232" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767914540473.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767914540473.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI Developer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Honestly... I’m a bit scared of that. I don't really get how Pub-Sub or Topics work. EDA sounds way too complex. Can’t we just keep it simple? The partner calls my CPI endpoint via HTTPS, I try to post to SAP, and if it fails, I’ll just trigger an error email or a basic retry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" style="width: 162px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359438iB6A2E203DD0429E3/image-dimensions/162x223/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="162" height="223" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;I get the fear. But in an event-driven world, control doesn’t disappear—it just shifts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Event Mesh becomes our safety net. The partner publishes, the broker holds the message, and CPI/S4 only consumes it when they’re ready. If S/4 is offline, the message doesn't die.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We don't kill the CPI with retries..&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;(Awkward silence)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_3-1767880643166.png" style="width: 187px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359448iCBE9CECA4DED323F/image-dimensions/187x231/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="187" height="231" role="button" title="rhviana_3-1767880643166.png" alt="rhviana_3-1767880643166.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP - Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;I get the concern, but in an event-driven world, control doesn’t disappear—it shifts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Event Mesh becomes our safety net. The partner publishes, the broker holds the message, and CPI/S4 only consumes it when ready.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;If S/4 is offline, the message doesn't die. We stop killing the CPI with retries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Let’s run a PoC with standard events first to prove the resilience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523767616"&gt;Final Proposal: SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you move to Event Mesh, you aren't just changing an endpoint. You’re redefining where the "safety" happens.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standard SAP Events → SAP Event Mesh:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Native, simple, and perfect for the SAP ecosystem.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom/Multi-platform Events → Advanced Event Mesh (AEM):&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is for the heavy lifting—more protocols, more capacity, and massive decoupling.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stop guessing with Pub-Sub:&lt;/STRONG&gt; We don't throw messages into the dark. The producer publishes, the broker saves it, and CPI subscribes only when it’s ready.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Kill the fear of losing data:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In a synchronous world, a crash kills the message. With AEM (AMQP), that message sits there safely until it's processed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1001621087" id="toc-hId-1327254111"&gt;Charting New Responsibilities on the possible migration from external vendors: Who Does What?&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;To witness the transformation from Soldier - SAP CPI&amp;nbsp;to General - SAP BTP Integration Suite Developer, one must reconfigure their mindset, gain governance experience, and, most importantly, understand the clear boundaries of authority for each role.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1130740606"&gt;Integration Architect&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the person who draws the "road map." When migrating from an external broker, they ensure the architecture isn't just a "copy and paste" job.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Messaging Patterns:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Decides how to translate patterns from the old broker to SAP (e.g., transforming a RabbitMQ "Exchange" into "Topics" and "Queues" in AEM).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Topic Strategy:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defines the Topic Hierarchy (Taxonomy). In AEM, this is vital for enabling intelligent routing and message filtering.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Payload Definition (CloudEvents):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Encourages the use of the &lt;STRONG&gt;CloudEvents&lt;/STRONG&gt; standard so that events remain platform-agnostic, facilitating future scalability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Global Error Handling:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defines the &lt;STRONG&gt;Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)&lt;/STRONG&gt; policy. If an event fails within SAP, where does it go? How is it reprocessed?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-934227101"&gt;Solution Architect&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Solution Architect doesn't just look at the code; they look at how the broker fits into the corporate ecosystem and the budget.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tool Selection (EM vs. AEM):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Decides whether the scenario requires the standard &lt;STRONG&gt;Event Mesh&lt;/STRONG&gt; (native, simple, S/4HANA events) or &lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced Event Mesh&lt;/STRONG&gt; (high volume, multi-cloud, complex protocols like MQTT/Solace).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Continuity:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defines SLAs. If the previous broker offered global redundancy, they ensure AEM delivers the same level of resilience.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TCO Analysis (Total Cost of Ownership):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Evaluates the cost of data egress from external brokers versus the savings of keeping traffic within the SAP BTP backbone.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security &amp;amp; Governance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defines how identities (OAuth, certificates) will be migrated to ensure only authorized systems publish or subscribe to events.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-737713596"&gt;SAP BTP Integration Consultant&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the person with hands-on expertise (EM, AEM) who ensures the data flow never stops.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Protocol Mapping:&lt;/STRONG&gt; If the legacy broker used JMS and SAP EM uses REST/AMQP, they configure the adapters and protocol bridges.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Event Mesh/AEM Configuration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Creates the Queues, Topic Subscriptions, and manages the Bridges between different data centers or clouds.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consumer Implementation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Within SAP Integration Suite (CPI), they configure iFlows to be "Event-Driven." Instead of polling for data, they set up Webhooks or AMQP senders to react instantly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Performance &amp;amp; Throttling:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Ensures the flow from AEM doesn't "overwhelm" the S/4HANA backend by configuring concurrency limits and backpressure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Migration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Executes the Cutover plan. They handle moving pending messages from the old broker to the new one without loss or duplication.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

pro means knowing that &lt;STRONG&gt;CPI is not a shock absorber.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Using Event Mesh or AEM is how you build a system that can actually handle the "real world events" (where systems go offline and things break).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the next part III, we’ll talk about the monst complex one, we are going to speak with T-REX

Today, we’re going deeper into &lt;/SPAN&gt;are going to talk about &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Advisor.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This is the third of four posts (the last one a summary because I will not explain SAP CPI, I'm expect that you know already), and we will navigate you through how to stop being “SAP CPI Developer” and become an SAP Integration Suite Consultant - "Generals".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Isaac Asimov once said: "The self-evident is that which is not seen until someone expresses it simply."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the world of B2B EDI, we have spent years overcomplicating the obvious with endless manual mappings. The SAP Integration Advisor is what finally expresses that complexity with simplicity. A "General" does not waste time redesigning what has already been standardized; instead, they leverage collective intelligence to focus on what truly matters: business strategy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1720302010"&gt;The "General" vs. The "Soldier" (A quick story)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me show you a imaginare conversation conversation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The following dialogue illustrates a common situation in integration projects when SAP BTP Integration Advisor is treated as an afterthought instead of an architectural capability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_8-1767907321493.png" style="width: 143px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359539i58825F304639EF1D/image-dimensions/143x197/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="143" height="197" role="button" title="rhviana_8-1767907321493.png" alt="rhviana_8-1767907321493.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our next big challenge is B2B EDI migration from external platform on a global scale. We are dealing with 50 international partners using a literal 'alphabet soup' of standards:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;specific variants of EDIFACT, ANSI X12, VDA for the automotive sector, and even RosettaNet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How do you plan to maintain governance over these mappings and ensure the support team doesn't get lost in a labyrinth of custom code and outdated Excel mapping sheets?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767954099415.png" style="width: 189px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359707i14B408B311DE298D/image-dimensions/189x282/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="189" height="282" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767954099415.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767954099415.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI Developer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Well, it's a manual grind. I’ll open the CPI graphical editor for each partner and start 'connecting the strings' (mapping). If a global rule changes, I’ll go into every single iFlow and update them manually. It’s complex and tedious, but that’s how I’ve always done it in CPI.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_10-1767907321495.png" style="width: 174px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359542iC851D492F3413F0C/image-dimensions/174x240/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="174" height="240" role="button" title="rhviana_10-1767907321495.png" alt="rhviana_10-1767907321495.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Manual only SAP CPI Iflows ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;That’s a compliance nightmare.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;What about documentation?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;What about industry standards ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;If you leave the project tomorrow, how will the next developer understand why field X was mapped to field Y specifically for partner number 32?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We can't scale a business on 'tribal knowledge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;(Awkward silence)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_11-1767907321496.png" style="width: 193px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359544i93575778C9F4462F/image-dimensions/193x238/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="193" height="238" role="button" title="rhviana_11-1767907321496.png" alt="rhviana_11-1767907321496.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP - Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;You’re right. CPI alone wasn't built to manage &lt;STRONG&gt;business semantics&lt;/STRONG&gt; at scale.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is exactly where the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Advisor (IA)&lt;/STRONG&gt; comes in.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We stop acting like 'manual mappers' and start acting like architects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By using IA, we leverage crowd-sourced AI to generate MIG's automated Mapping Guidelines (MAGs) that are standardized, the EDI contract in the TPM and self-documenting, and easy to maintain across all 50 partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523788505"&gt;Final Proposal: SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governance via MIGs (Message Implementation Guidelines):&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is where business semantics become law. Instead of the developer arbitrarily deciding what a field represents, we create &lt;STRONG&gt;MIGs&lt;/STRONG&gt; under the Architect’s supervision. The Architect defines the company’s &lt;STRONG&gt;'Golden Standard'&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensuring standardized fields and precise semantic descriptions. Structural governance is centralized within the Advisor library, rather than being scattered across 50 different iFlows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Power of MAGs (Mapping Guidelines):&lt;/STRONG&gt; As a consultant, I use the Integration Advisor to generate &lt;STRONG&gt;MAGs&lt;/STRONG&gt; powered by Machine Learning. The IA suggests mappings based on collective intelligence—what the global ecosystem has already validated. This reduces manual effort by over 60%, ensuring that the "Golden Rule" comes from the official SAP library, not technical guesswork.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TPM (Trading Partner Management) as the Controller:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is the true game-changer. The Architect acts as the &lt;STRONG&gt;Controller&lt;/STRONG&gt;, managing all partners within the &lt;STRONG&gt;TPM&lt;/STRONG&gt; portal. This is where we centralize contract registries, B2B agreements, and security certificates. In CPI, the developer simply consumes what has been governed in the TPM, ensuring total compliance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI as the Execution Middleware:&lt;/STRONG&gt; CPI acts as the engine that processes SAP’s &lt;STRONG&gt;Standard Pre-packaged Content (iFlows)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. To ensure the architecture is both resilient and extensible, we use CPI’s power for &lt;STRONG&gt;PRE or POST-mapping&lt;/STRONG&gt; manipulations. Whenever a MAG reaches its limits with complex mapping requirements, we intervene with &lt;STRONG&gt;Groovy scripts or XSLT&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

In a migration from external vendors of B2B EDI, success depends on knowing how SAP Integration Advisor works and how to import and configure the stantard Iflows for this type of integration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1130740606" id="toc-hId-1130761495"&gt;Integration Architect&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology Analysis:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They evaluate the technical fit from external platform provides for EDI integration vs&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Advisor&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Communication Standards:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They check and analise the possibles protocols used for EDI's&amp;nbsp; (AMQP, MQTT, REST, AS2,AS4,VAN,API,OFTP2) and ensure they align with the SAP APIM e SAP CPI possibilities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-934247990"&gt;Solution Architect&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Migration Roadmap:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They define the phases of the migration and the ROI of moving to SAP BTP Integration Advisor + SAP CPI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Risk Management:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They verify if the migration complies with industry regulations and internal security policies.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Final Approval:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They authorize the "Golden Standards" that will be used across the entire suite.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-866817204"&gt;SAP BTP Integration Consultant&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is the person with hands-on expertise SAP Integration Advisor to support the bussiness on the creation of MIG and MAG's&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Execution (The Scope):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Their primary responsibility is the creation and optimization of &lt;STRONG&gt;MAGs (Mapping Guidelines)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensuring the engine (CPI) runs the business logic perfectly through iFlows if need extra logic apply groovy, or XSLT in duty of restrictions in MAG for complex logics&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Boundaries (Out of Scope):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; To maintain the integrity of the role, the following are &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;NOT&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; the sole responsibility of the Consultant, but rather corporate governance assets provided by the Architects:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governance Policies:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defining the overall rules of engagement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIG Creation &amp;amp; Semantic Definitions:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The "Business Language" must be defined by the Architect/Business Owner.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Naming Conventions:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Global standards must be established at the architectural level.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TPM Registration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Managing trading partner contracts and legal agreements is a business/governance function, not a developer task.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_1-1767950931242.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359668iA2CC79255F26C022/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1767950931242.png" alt="rhviana_1-1767950931242.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 1 - SAP Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-541220980"&gt;Conclusion — Part III&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Being a "General" means realizing that &lt;STRONG&gt;standardization is your best weapon.&lt;/STRONG&gt; With the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Advisor&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you stop being a slave to manual mapping and start leading with architectural intelligence.

It is where traffic is controlled, abuse is blocked, and contracts are enforced.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;APIM is where:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Traffic is controlled&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Abuse is blocked&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Contracts are enforced&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP CPI is protected from becoming a firewall&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key realization:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;If garbage reaches CPI, the architecture has already failed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/sap-btp-is-how-to-become-a-sap-integration-suite-consultant-beyond-sap-cpi/ba-p/14302203" target="_self"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Read Part I — SAP API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP BTP - IS - How to become a SAP Integration Suite Consultant beyond SAP CPI - SAP EM/AEM Part II&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We moved into Event-Driven Architecture.

It was about mastering the full capacity of the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Integration Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt; and understanding how to orchestrate its platforms to drive better definitions, smarter configurations, and clearer responsibilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In any point of this series I mean that you are going to be Senior in APIM,EM,AEM,IS also, it's depends 100% of you cross this way.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1652874237"&gt;From General to Commander: The Mastery&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In this series we discussed the &lt;STRONG&gt;"General"&lt;/STRONG&gt; mindset—the ability to look at the integration battlefield (the SAP BTP Integration Suite Landscape) and understand where each unit (APIM, Event Mesh, IA, CPI) belongs, but there is a rank beyond the General:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Commander&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;If a General understands the integration strategy, the Commander owns the full execution of that strategy using all componentes in its deepest, most complex forms. This transition isn't granted by a SAP certification; it is forged through high-stakes exposure and relentless curiosity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1456360732"&gt;The Evolution of Skill -&amp;nbsp;General to Commander&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;The transition from a General to a Commander isn't about learning new tools; it is about changing your relationship with the ones you already have. It is the move from strategic oversight to tactical mastery.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1259847227"&gt;API Management (APIM)&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The General:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Focuses on the basics—setting up proxies, managing API Keys, and configuring standard OpenAPI/Swagger files to expose services.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Commander&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Architects "Intelligence Gateways." They treat Swagger as the absolute law, using custom JavaScript to shape complex traffic and governing AI/OpenAI integrations with the precision of a master tactician.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1063333722"&gt;Event-Driven Architecture (EM/AEM)&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The General&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Understands the value of Pub/Sub+ and knows how to avoid the trap of point-to-point connections.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TheCommander:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Orchestrates the "Neural System" of the enterprise. They master the nuances of cross-cloud event bridges, implement sophisticated queue sharding for massive scale, and design bulletproof Dead Letter Office (DLO) strategies to ensure zero data loss.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-866820217"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integration Advisor (IA)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The General:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Now how to uses MIGs and MAGs primarily to accelerate the speed of message mapping.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Commander:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Evolves into a Functional Architect. They master the "DNA of Business," enforcing global semantic standards across MIG the landscape and using TPM to govern partner ecosystems and MAG for mapping ensuring the data model remains a "Source of Truth" rather than a library of chaos.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-670306712"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Problem Solving&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The General: &lt;/STRONG&gt;Responds to incidents by finding the error and fixing the iFlow so the message can pass.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Commander:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Stops "fixing" bugs and starts "eliminating" them and just create Iflows to connect the systems.They redesign the integration architecture to be inherently resilient, exception mechanism, retry mechanism, re-engineering the integration landscape so that once a specific failure occurs, it becomes physically impossible for it to repeat.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-473793207"&gt;Mastery is Not a Badge or Certification&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;You cannot "study" your way to becoming a Commander. You must be "exposed" to it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Project Exposure:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A Commander is someone who has seen an Event Mesh collapse under a million messages and knew how to tune the back-pressure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Independent Exploration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They don't wait for a client requirement or your company look for course for you, be prohactive. They break the tool in a trial account on a Saturday just to see where the boundaries are.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Certification Trap:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Let’s be honest—&lt;STRONG&gt;there is no single certification that proves you are a Senior in APIM, EM/AEM &lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Advisor simultaneously&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the SAP HANA Cloud 2025 Q3 release, several new embedded Machine Learning / AI functions&amp;nbsp;have been released with the SAP HANA Cloud Predictive Analysis Library (PAL) and the Automated Predictive Library (APL). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An enhancement summary is available in the What’s new document for &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/whats-new/2495b34492334456a49084831c2bea4e?Category=Predictive+Analysis+Library&amp;amp;Valid_as_Of=2025-09-01:2025-09-30&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP HANA Cloud database 2025.28 (QRC 3/2025)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1787736735"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1591223230"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Time series analysis and forecasting function enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Threshold support in timeseries outlier detection &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In time series, an outlier is a data point that is different from the general behavior of remaining data points.&amp;nbsp; In the PAL &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;time series outlier detection&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; function, the outlier detection task is divided into two steps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In step 1 the residual values are derived from the original series, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In step 2, the outliers are detected from the residual values.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Multiple methods are available to evaluate a data point to be an outlier or not. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Including Z1 score, Z2 score, IIQR score, MAD score, IsolationForest, DBSCAN&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If used in combination, outlier voting can be applied for a combined evaluation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now, &lt;STRONG&gt;new&lt;/STRONG&gt; and in addition, &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;thresholds values for outlier scores&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; are supported&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New parameter OUTPUT_OUTLIER_THRESHOLD &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Based on the given threshold value, if the time series value is beyond the (upper and lower) outlier threshold for the time series, the corresponding data point as an outlier.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Only valid when outlier_method = 'iqr', 'isolationforest', 'mad', 'z1', 'z2'.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ChristophMorgen_0-1767958753257.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359750iE20F7716FF87FA07/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ChristophMorgen_0-1767958753257.jpeg" alt="ChristophMorgen_0-1767958753257.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1394709725"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Classification and regression function enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Corset sampling support with SVM models&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Coreset sampling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a machine learning technique to&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;select a small, representative subset (the "coreset") from larger datasets,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;enabling faster, more efficient training and processing while maintaining similar model accuracy as using the full data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It works by identifying the most "informative" samples, filtering out redundant or noisy data, and allowing complex algorithms to run on a manageable dataset sizes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Support Vector Machine (SVM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;model training is computationally expensive, and computational costs are specifically sensitive to the number of training points, which makes SVM models often impractical for large datasets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Therefore SVM in the Predictive Analysis Library has been enhanced and now&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;offers&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;embedded coreset sampling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;capabilities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;enabled with the new parameters USE_CORESET and CORESET_SCALE as the &lt;SPAN&gt;sampling ratio when constructing coreset&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This enhancement significantly reduces SVM training time with minimal impact on accuracy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ChristophMorgen_1-1767958753264.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359751iDA955B4D29D2C3A9/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ChristophMorgen_1-1767958753264.png" alt="ChristophMorgen_1-1767958753264.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1198196220"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AutoML and pipeline function enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Target encoding support in&amp;nbsp;AutoML&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The PAL AutoML framework introduces a new pipeline operator for target encoding of categorial features&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Categorical data is often required to be preprocessed and required to get converted from non-numerical features into formats suitable for the respective machine learning algorithm, i.e. numeric values&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Examples features: text labels (e.g., “red,” “blue”) or discrete categories (e.g., “high,” “medium,” “low”)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;One-hot encoding converts each categorial feature value &amp;nbsp;into a binary column (0 or 1), which works well for features with a limited number of unique values. PAL already applies an optimized one-hot encoding method aggregating very low frequent values.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Target encoding replaces the categorial values with the mean of the target / label column for high-cardinality features, which avoids to create large and sparse one-hot encoded feature matrices&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Example of a high cardinality feature: “city” column with hundreds-thousands of unique values, postal code, product IDs etc.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The PAL AutoML engine will analyze the input feature cardinality and then automatically decide if to apply target encoding or another encoding method. For medium to high cardinality categorial features, target encoding may improve the performance significantly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By automating target encoding, the PAL AutoML engine aims to improve model performance and generalization, especially when dealing with complex, high-cardinality categorical features, without requiring manual intervention.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, the AutoML and pipeline function now also support columns of type half precision vector.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1001682715"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-805169210"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Misc. Machine Learning and statistics function enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;High-dimensional feature data reduction using UMAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm used to simplify complex, high-dimensional feature spaces, while preserving its essential structure. It is widely considered the modern gold standard for visualizing targeted dimension reduction of large-scale datasets, because it balances computational speed with the ability to maintain both local and global relationships.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It reduces thousands of variables (dimensions) into 2D or 3D scatter plots that humans can easily interpret.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Unlike comparable methods like t-SNE, UMAP is better at preserving global structure, meaning the relative positions between different clusters remain more meaningful.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than t-SNE, capable of processing datasets with millions of points in a reasonable timeframe.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It can be used as a "transformer" preprocessing step in Machine Learning scenarios to reduce large feature spaces before applying clustering (e.g., k-means, HDBSCAN) or classification models, often improving their performance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The following new functions are introduced&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;_SYS_AFL.PAL_UMAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;​ with the most important &lt;SPAN&gt;parameters N_NEIGHBORS, MIN_DIST, N_COMPONENTS, DISTANCE_LEVEL&lt;/SPAN&gt;​&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;_SYS_AFL.PAL_TRUSTWORTHINESS&lt;/SPAN&gt;​, u&lt;SPAN&gt;sed to measure the structure similarity between original high dimensional space and embedded low dimensional space based on K nearest neighbors.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Calculating pairwise distances&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Many algorithms, for example clustering algorithms utilize distance matrixes as a preprocessing step, often inbuild to the functions. While often there is the wish to decouple though the distance matrix calculation from the follow-up task like the actual clustering. Moreover, if decoupled custom calculated matrixes can be fed into algorithms as input.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Most PAL clustering functions support to feed-in a pre-calculated similarity matrix&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now, a dedicated &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-predictive-analysis-library/distance-md?version=LATEST&amp;amp;q=distance&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pairwise distance calculation&lt;/A&gt; function is provided &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It supports distance metrics like &lt;EM&gt;Manhattan, Euclidien, Minkowski, Chebyshey&lt;/EM&gt; as well as &lt;STRONG&gt;Levenshtein&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Levenshtein distance&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; (or “edit distance”) is a distance metric specifically targeting distance between text-columns. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one word into another, acting as a measure of their similarity. A lower distance indicates a higher similarity.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Applicable use cases&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is useful in data cleaning, table column similarity analysis between columns of the same data type.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After calculating the column similarity across all data types, clustering like K-Means can be applied to group similar fields and propose mappings for fields within the same cluster&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Real Vector data type support&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following PAL functions have been enhanced to support columns of type real vector&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Spectral Clustering&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cluster Assignment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Decision tree&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sampling&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition the AutoML and pipeline function now also support columns of type half precision vector.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-608655705"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Creating Vector Embeddings enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP HANA Database Vector Engine function VECTOR_EMBEDDING()&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;has added support for remote, SAP AI Core exposed embedding models.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello SAP Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My name is Pierre, and I'm 62 yo.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I worked as a Senior Director, Product Communications at SAP, first for &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP%2520Intelligent%2520Robotic%2520Process%2520Automation/pd-p/73554900100800002142" target="_self"&gt;SAP Intelligent RPA&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;as Head of Communications then for &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP%2520Build/pd-p/73555000100700001491" target="_self"&gt;SAP Build&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;as the oldest member, by far &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;, of the Product Communications and Enablement Team, with wonderful colleagues that I miss. 🩵&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since April 2025, I'm not actively working for SAP anymore, as I was lucky enough to be &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/so-this-is-it-i-m-verped/ba-p/14068989" target="_self"&gt;eligible for the Voluntary Early Retiring Plan&lt;/A&gt; launched by SAP in 2024. On one side I really miss the wonderful colleagues I was working with, but on the other side I'm very happy to have more time for my hobbies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;I’d like to share a bit about my hobbies as a part of the &amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/community-corner-blog-posts/bg-p/Coffee-Cornerblog-board/label-name/hobbies" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Community Hobbies series&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1658620262"&gt;First hobby: building Legos&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I have always loved building things with Lego: my brother Jean-François and I got our first Lego set when I was 5, and throughout our childhood we played Lego a lot, with our father guiding us. We built houses, castles, and also vehicles with the electric motor etc.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Then in 1978, at age 15, I discovered the first microcomputers, and I turned away a bit from Lego to code my first computer programs.&lt;BR /&gt;You will find more about my beginnings as a progammer in the blog post &lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/blog-it-forward-pierre-col/ba-p/13449598" target="_blank"&gt;Blog it Forward – Pierre Col&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;I published exactly 6 years ago.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It's also because I love building from scratch that I was very happy to work for &lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP%2520Build/pd-p/73555000100700001491" target="_self"&gt;SAP Build&lt;/A&gt;: this low-code + pro-code solution allows business users and developers to very easily build applications, automated processes, and websites.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For Christmas 2024, my youngest daughter offered me the &lt;A href="https://www.lego.com/fr-fr/product/porsche-911-10295" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lego Porsche 911 set&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;: 1458 parts, to build either a Turbo or a Targa. I have completed the building in a few months:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="legos.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359847i48F79D0643C5F11F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="legos.jpg" alt="legos.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I like this activity very much, because building Legos really helps me relaxing.&lt;BR /&gt;To be continued!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1462106757"&gt;Second hobby: riding my vintage bikes&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;You will understand that I'm a petrolhead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, I have always been into motorbikes, because my father was a biker.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1394675971"&gt;From Norton...&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 1973, when I was 10 yo, he sold the Norton 88 I've ever seen in the garage to buy a magnificent&amp;nbsp; '1970 Norton Commando.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And every morning he was driving me to the high school, on the way to his work. You can easily imagine how proud I was...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My father always kept this bike in his garage, riding it until he was 75 yo. When I was visiting my parents, I regularly did some small tours on the Norton to keep it up and running.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="IMG_20230112_103713_081.jpg" style="width: 701px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359095iC9F548A231A2D9FE/image-dimensions/701x709/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="701" height="709" role="button" title="IMG_20230112_103713_081.jpg" alt="IMG_20230112_103713_081.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When my father passed, almost 4 years ago, in accordance with my brother I inherited his bike. I did not ride it since then, and I will spend some time this Spring to restart it and ride it again in the countryside around Lyon...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="IMG_20230318_150528_031.jpg" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359096iCC9C19E645E76697/image-dimensions/640x386/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="640" height="386" role="button" title="IMG_20230318_150528_031.jpg" alt="IMG_20230318_150528_031.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can hear the wonderful sound of the Norton Twin roaring&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://soundcloud.com/pierrecol/norton-750-commando" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1198162466"&gt;&lt;A href="https://soundcloud.com/pierrecol/norton-750-commando" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Norton 750 Commando - acceleration by Pierre Col on SoundCloud.png" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359122iEB9BAB972F8FAAED/image-dimensions/640x360/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="640" height="360" role="button" title="Norton 750 Commando - acceleration by Pierre Col on SoundCloud.png" alt="Norton 750 Commando - acceleration by Pierre Col on SoundCloud.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1001648961"&gt;... to Honda...&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 1981, my first motorbike was a Honda 750 Four. With 67 hp for 220 kg, it was for me an incredibly powerful bike. In 1987 I bought a Honda CB 900 Bol d'Or which I still own:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="900 Bol d'Or 3 images 1600 px.png" style="width: 799px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359136iB575CF49F865C24B/image-dimensions/799x544/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="799" height="544" role="button" title="900 Bol d'Or 3 images 1600 px.png" alt="900 Bol d'Or 3 images 1600 px.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I lent it in 1997 to an uncle living in Grenoble, he stills ride it but as he is 75yo now I imagine that he won't ride it for very long and I should get the 900 Bol d'Or back in my garage in a couple of years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-805135456"&gt;... and finally to Ducati&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since 1997, I ride Ducati motorbikes. It started with a 916, then I had a 350 Mark3 Desmo, a 900 Supersport, a 998 S, a Desmosedici RR and a Panigale 1299 R Final Edition. Yes, I really like fast red bike made in Bologna!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Panigale Final Edition, with 209 hp for 168 kg, was the most powerful and amazing bike I'ev ever ridden.&amp;nbsp;Indeed, even if it was a MotoGP replica with a V4 engine revving up to 14,200 rpm, the Desmosedici RR was not as efficient as the Panigale...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And I really enjoyed the very light and agile '1973 350 Mark3 Desmo I had during a few years, riding it on teh road as on tracks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="20251208_181337.jpg" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359100i10F3CF15F3C14C5A/image-dimensions/640x640/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="640" height="640" role="button" title="20251208_181337.jpg" alt="20251208_181337.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, fancy bikes attract thieves: bought in 1997, my 916 was stolen in 1999. My 998 S bought in 2002 and my rare Desmosedici RR #282 bought in 2007 were stolen in 2011. And my Panigale 1299 R Final Edition #322 bought in 2017 was stolen in 2023.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="IMG_20230525_140259.jpg" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359099i788228AEED0C52B6/image-dimensions/640x640/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="640" height="640" role="button" title="IMG_20230525_140259.jpg" alt="IMG_20230525_140259.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After some bastards stole my Panigale, I refurbished my good old '1994 900 Supersport which I bought in 2000, and lent to a friend from 2004 to 2019. I'm really enjoying riding this light (180 kg) and powerful enough (80 hp) bike on the curvy road in the hills, one hour northwest from Lyon:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="900 Supersport with me.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359848i71EC1A664B8A0AFF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="900 Supersport with me.jpg" alt="900 Supersport with me.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-479539232"&gt;Third hobby: driving my vintage 911 Porsche cabriolet&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 2011, right after insurance reimbursed my stolen Desmosedici RR, a good friend of mine decided to sell his 1990 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 cabriolet. It was the same car that hank Moody was driving in "Californication", but in better shape, with 135,000 km on the odometer. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Porsche 911.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359849iF5BD7F8E71805A56/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Porsche 911.jpg" alt="Porsche 911.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We quickly had a deal, and since more than 14 years I enjoy riding this vintage car, in any weather condition. I just passed 180,000 km and it works perfectly fine. According to my mechanic, my Porsche could reach 250,000 km without any trouble, and as I drive less than 5,000 km per year, for sure it will survive me:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="20210103_145951.jpg" style="width: 711px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359109iCF13EEA6BA164039/image-dimensions/711x400/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="711" height="400" role="button" title="20210103_145951.jpg" alt="20210103_145951.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As my wife will be very busy in May 2026, I decided that I will do&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;a "5,000 km in 3-4 weeks" road trip across Central Europe in my Porsche 911: I will pay a visit to my former colleagues in Walldorf, Berlin and maybe a few other cities in Germany before heading to Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland...&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-541191165"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="map + photos.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359850i4CD094A6067CE903/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="map + photos.jpg" alt="map + photos.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-344677660"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Feel free to say hello if you would like me to pay you a visit, between May 1st and May 23:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;I will be more than happy to let you drive my Porsche in your neighborhood! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="keep calm 180K km.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359860i0A82AF9F8A6DEA5F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="keep calm 180K km.jpg" alt="keep calm 180K km.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a new and innovative feature of API Management, part of the SAP Integration Suite. Expanding on traditional API Management, Graph allows you to present all your business data as a semantically connected data graph, accessible through a single, unified, and powerful API.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Graph in SAP Integration Suite is now available for a limited time as a closed beta program and includes the following new features:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A configuration UI for creating business data graphs – an extension of the new Integration Suite configuration UI.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The ability to extend the built-in Graph data model.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Graph Navigator (Enterprise Edition) – a tool for exploring and testing queries on your configured business data graphs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;GraphQL support (in addition to OData v4).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Graph Capability in Integration Suite: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="azharsd_0-1767780018922.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358850iFB77C48768FA66FE/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="azharsd_0-1767780018922.png" alt="azharsd_0-1767780018922.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Graph can be used in any SAP Integration Suite plan where API Management is available (including SAP BTP trial accounts), but not necessarily in every region where API Management is available. For more details about the regional availability of Graph, be sure to check out &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;SAP Note 3338820&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enabling Graph on your Integration Suite&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensuring the Required Roles and Enabling Graph&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Make sure you have the &lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Suite Provisioner&lt;/STRONG&gt; role.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigate to &lt;STRONG&gt;"Manage Capabilities" → "Add Capabilities"&lt;/STRONG&gt; in your Integration Suite home.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enable &lt;STRONG&gt;API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; (if not already enabled) through the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Manage APIs"&lt;/STRONG&gt; section.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enable &lt;STRONG&gt;API Business Hub Enterprise&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt; (API Business Hub Enterprise is mandatory for Graph).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If &lt;STRONG&gt;Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt; is not visible, refer to &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;SAP Note 3338820&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as it may not be supported in your region.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;"Enable API Business Hub Enterprise"&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;"Graph"&lt;/STRONG&gt; to complete the setup.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Graph requires &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; to be activated.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="azharsd_1-1767780018932.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358852i48170E6B180E0B97/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="azharsd_1-1767780018932.png" alt="azharsd_1-1767780018932.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Assigning Roles for Graph&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once &lt;STRONG&gt;Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt;

This could be a S/4Hana On-Premises System or a S/4Hana Public Cloud Edition System. These are classic ODATA APIs from SAP –&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Business Partner ODATA API&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sales Order ODATA API&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note: In my case I’m using SAP Business Accelerator Hub – API HUB &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Querying Sales Orders and Customer Details with SAP Graph&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In a &lt;STRONG&gt;typical integration scenario&lt;/STRONG&gt;, querying &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Orders&lt;/STRONG&gt; from &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt; and fetching &lt;STRONG&gt;Customer Details (SoldToParty)&lt;/STRONG&gt; involves:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Making an OData GET request&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order API&lt;/STRONG&gt; to retrieve Sales Order details.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Making another OData GET request&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Business Partner API&lt;/STRONG&gt; to fetch the corresponding &lt;STRONG&gt;SoldToParty&lt;/STRONG&gt; details.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enriching the data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; using &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; to combine the two datasets.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Since SAP provides this information through &lt;STRONG&gt;two separate APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, this approach traditionally requires &lt;STRONG&gt;two API calls&lt;/STRONG&gt; and additional processing to merge the data. However, with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Graph (BDGs - Business Data Graphs)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you can simplify this by using a &lt;STRONG&gt;single GraphQL query&lt;/STRONG&gt; to fetch Sales Orders and their associated Customer details in one call.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Simplifying Data Retrieval with SAP Graph&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Traditionally, in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;, fetching &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order&lt;/STRONG&gt; details along with &lt;STRONG&gt;SoldToParty (Customer Details)&lt;/STRONG&gt; from &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt; requires:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Multiple OData API calls&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; (one for Sales Orders, one for Business Partners).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Content Enrichers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to merge and process the data.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Lookups&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to fetch related information across different API endpoints.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is a &lt;STRONG&gt;common challenge&lt;/STRONG&gt; when integrating SAP and non-SAP &lt;STRONG&gt;SaaS applications&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Power of SAP Graph (BDGs - Business Data Graphs)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Graph on Integration Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you can retrieve all this data in &lt;STRONG&gt;one API call&lt;/STRONG&gt;—with &lt;STRONG&gt;no custom development&lt;/STRONG&gt;!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Graph introduces the concept of &lt;STRONG&gt;Mirrored Entities&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which allows you to:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Access data from &lt;STRONG&gt;multiple APIs as a single, unified data model&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Query related entities (e.g., Sales Orders and SoldToParty) &lt;STRONG&gt;in a single request&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reduce integration complexity and &lt;STRONG&gt;eliminate the need for multiple lookups/enrichers&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We’ll explore &lt;STRONG&gt;Mirrored Entities&lt;/STRONG&gt; in SAP Graph and see how they can &lt;STRONG&gt;simplify&lt;/STRONG&gt; fetching &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order details&lt;/STRONG&gt; along with &lt;STRONG&gt;Customer details&lt;/STRONG&gt; from an &lt;STRONG&gt;Business Accelerator Hub—all in one call&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Creating Destinations on SAP BTP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To integrate SAP Graph with your &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;
