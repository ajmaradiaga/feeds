    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1787644355"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_y4jpb8y4jpb8y4jp.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358043i322E944DE1F47984/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Gemini_Generated_Image_y4jpb8y4jpb8y4jp.png" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_y4jpb8y4jpb8y4jp.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1591130850"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are all familiar with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by now. It has become the standard architecture for bringing enterprise data to Large Language Models (LLMs). The pattern is simple: chunk your documents, create vector embeddings, and perform a similarity search.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But as we move from "Proof of Concept" to production, we are hitting a ceiling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard Vector RAG is excellent at finding things that "sound like" your query (semantic similarity), but it struggles with &lt;STRONG&gt;structure&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;reasoning&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It can tell you that "Alice works at SAP," but it often fails at multi-hop questions like "Who works in the same department as the person who wrote the Q3 report?"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where &lt;STRONG&gt;GraphRAG&lt;/STRONG&gt; enters the picture. And the best part? If you are on SAP BTP, you already have one of the most powerful engines for this architecture: &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1394617345"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Limitations of "Flat" Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In a standard Vector Store, your data is essentially a pile of isolated chunks. When you search, you grab the top 5 chunks from the pile. You lose the context of how those chunks relate to one another.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This becomes even more critical when dealing with &lt;STRONG&gt;Multimodal Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Real-world enterprise documents aren't just text; they are PDFs containing diagrams, flowcharts, and architecture schematics. In a standard vector process, these images are often ignored or separated from the text that explains them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1198103840"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Solution: Hybrid GraphRAG&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The next evolution of AI on SAP BTP isn't about choosing between Vector Search or Knowledge Graphs. It is about using &lt;STRONG&gt;both&lt;/STRONG&gt;. I have been exploring a "Hybrid" approach where we use:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Vector Engine&lt;/STRONG&gt; (built into SAP HANA Cloud) for fuzzy, semantic search.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Graph Engine&lt;/STRONG&gt; (RDF/SPARQL in SAP HANA Cloud) for precise, structured relationships.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine SAP HANA Cloud as a "Super Librarian." It has a messy pile of fuzzy ideas (Vectors) and a neat corkboard of connected facts (The Knowledge Graph). To answer a complex business question, the system checks the fuzzy pile to understand the &lt;I&gt;intent&lt;/I&gt;, but validates the answer against the corkboard to ensure &lt;I&gt;factual accuracy&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1001590335"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multimodal RAG: Keeping Context Intact&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most exciting capabilities of this hybrid approach is handling mixed media.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_a8g428a8g428a8g4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358044i5A20DB269351B91F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Gemini_Generated_Image_a8g428a8g428a8g4.png" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_a8g428a8g428a8g4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When processing complex documentation (like technical manuals or financial reports), we can use the graph to create &lt;STRONG&gt;structural links&lt;/STRONG&gt;. We can index a diagram or an image not just by what is inside it, but by &lt;I&gt;where it sits in the document&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By modeling the document structure in the Knowledge Graph (e.g., &lt;CODE&gt;TextChunk A&lt;/CODE&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;CODE&gt;ADJACENT_TO&lt;/CODE&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;CODE&gt;Image B&lt;/CODE&gt;), we ensure that when an LLM retrieves the text explanation, it automatically pulls the relevant diagram along with it. This creates a true Multimodal RAG experience that "sees" the document the way a human does.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-805076830"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why SAP HANA Cloud?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Usually, building this architecture requires a complex stack: a vector database (like Pinecone), a graph database (like Neo4j), and a relational database to glue them together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP HANA Cloud is unique because it is truly &lt;STRONG&gt;multi-model &lt;/STRONG&gt;(yes it's also multimodal with this library). You can store your vectors, your RDF triples, and your relational metadata all in the same persistence layer. This simplifies the architecture immensely and reduces data movement, which is critical for enterprise security and latency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-608563325"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A New Framework for SAP Developers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To prove this concept, I have developed a TypeScript framework designed specifically for Node.js environments on SAP BTP. It acts as a bridge, orchestrating the interaction between the LLM (via LiteLLM) and SAP HANA Cloud’s dual engines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The framework handles:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Schema-Guided Extraction:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Using LLMs to turn unstructured text into clean Knowledge Graph entities (Nodes and Edges).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hybrid Retrieval:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Performing a vector search and then traversing the graph to find related context (including images).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Unified Storage:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Managing both the &lt;CODE&gt;REAL_VECTOR&lt;/CODE&gt; data and RDF Triples in a single connection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-412049820"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Learn More&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are interested in building the next generation of context-aware AI agents on SAP BTP, I invite you to read the full technical breakdown here (collaboration on the repo welcome!):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://medium.com/@techandfun/beyond-vectors-building-powerful-graph-rag-on-sap-btp-with-hana-cloud-50da841bb31f" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Read the full article on Medium: Beyond Vectors - Building Powerful Graph RAG on SAP BTP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s move beyond simple similarity search and start building AI that truly understands the structure of our enterprise data.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

We are going to focus on service scenarios in BTP Integraton Suite that also reach out to external carbon-based solutions, for example MuleSoft, Bomi, SnapLogic and Solace but also SAP BTP API Management, Advanced Event Mesh and SAP Integration Advisor&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This is a sort of &lt;STRONG&gt;"is what I have leaned over the years"&lt;/STRONG&gt; type of discussion, as opposed to having been produced just for the purposes of microscope slide making (or framework development).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In this blog series, I want to make some experiences available as developer since SAP XI/PI/PO/CPI longterm. Here are three I need to play with that should do the trick for the community devs to get their heads around:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Also, as an SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultant, I encourage you to dream big and express what you think. Once you have this deep understanding of what is possible with the SAP BTP Integration Suite, not only SAP CPI, you’ll be able to stand as equal with architects in a conversation and shape what that effective environment should look like.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let have this thrilling journey together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1591134760"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How I saw some Frankenstein architectures being born: three real cases&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In my long career, I have seen plenty of tools that offered to alleviate such complexity only to introduce complexity where none was warranted. One thing to keep in mind is that every tool or company, such as SAP, but also any other vendor has their pros and cons. But the benefits of normalizing these architectures are hard to ignore: less customization, better support, and more cohesive teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523703974"&gt;Case 1: Wasted Potential&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;When I started performing in this one “As sort of a fresh consultant with SAP BTP Integration Suite” working essentially as SAP PI/PO/CPI Consultant and my role was to glue the pieces i.e. boxes and mappings back again. I did not have the experience or courage to communicate my views back then, I believe that also led to suboptimal results. However, this was also a learning experience for the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The project was well-structured with explicit rules, standards, APIs and development models. Yet the external architects at the beginning of a migration to S/4HANA hadn’t considered implementations that already existed. … Even if SAP BTP (SAP Integration Suite – APIM and CPI) was there, they threw away this investment and capability on leveraging more strategic decisions and using the minimum as possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Consequently, no usage of the APIM was allowed at all and SAP CPI could only be classified as vanilla-prepackaged with as few adjustements. A second vendor took over the entire APIM infrastructure and bespoke integrations. The result was the undercutting of what had been a winning game plan.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1327190469"&gt;Case 2: Application of External Architecture Patterns&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In that case I was similarly unable to remember granular details about APIM and Events Management. The Iflow were my concern and here I spotted a considerable design issue, lets call it flaw: that the payload being kept in datastore is nothing more than an output of a mapping logic making it futile.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This was a “three layer design – Intelligence Layer, Processing/Routing Layer and the Delivery Layer” that was enforced on top of SAP CPI, which came from an entirely different area all together. To preserve this false structure, the solution became rather complex chain of hundreds JMS queues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1130676964"&gt;Case 3: Scattered teams and technologies&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;I am not going to discuss in depth about APIM and Events with other vendors. One organization did adopt BTP in piecemeal via Events/API but SAP CPI were the only service that came together and was used appropriately. Duties were separated into teams that didn't talk to each other. In the end, this lack of coordination resulted in higher costs and complexity – which is breaking the very synergy SAP BTP Integration Suite was designed for: SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-675998021"&gt;The Emergence Of “Frankenstein” Architectures And Why Decoupled Integration Does Not Succeed&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Organizations have the tendency to spend millions in SAP BTP without fully leveraging its strategic capabilities. But what we end up with is &lt;STRONG&gt;"Frankenstein Architectures"&lt;/STRONG&gt; – a collection of parts cut and sewn into a jumble of ill-formed systems. The linked parts may be powerful, but the ecosystem is inherently weak.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These are hardly ever genuine technical constraints. Rather, they emerge from:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Architectural Bigotry:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Choices created by management who don’t really understanding the SAP integration terrain.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lack of Trend Following:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Excessive focus on the latest buzzwords, without considering the merits of having a complete ecosystem.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Siloed communication:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; A gap between high-level architects and the developers working with SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;With SAP at the core of your backend, be it ECC or S/4HANA then BTP is something else altogether on a different level, and I mean because that’s where its roots are from. Despite the necessity of third-party integrations, there comes a point when the trade-off between “market-trending” external tools and native connectors actually incurs a technical debt that negates the end customer’s requirement for stability. Different systems can live together side by side, but nothing comes close to the level of integration offered in SAP world with SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767600837094.png" style="width: 862px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358079i07775F446E0FF613/image-dimensions/862x572/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="862" height="572" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767600837094.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767600837094.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 1: Frankenstein Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-479484516"&gt;The Trap of the “Legacy Mindset”: The Real Barrier to True Innovation&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Although we can critique tools, vendors and platforms till the cows come home, on some level our constraints are not technological at all. The greatest hindrance to a successful innovation experience is habit, accumulated over years of dependence on legacy systems. Such statements as “we won’t touch it, it’s working,” “the developer already is not with a project” and “there are no any docs” belong to the type that depends on stable but inflexible architecture. This leads to known experiences that do not evolve, led by a strong fear of the new.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;There are many that still operate under the paradigm of on-premise integration landscapes from a decade ago. This oldskool attitude results in a frustration tainted with fear of the new, or unfamiliar paradigms and perhaps more often than not, a mis-appreciation of what today's platforms are capable of.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;A real innovation requires to think differently. The question should not be “How do I generate this map?” a closer look: “Is this a map? Should it be an event? An API? Or whether it should exist at all in its current version?”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Without such a crucial change, old habits can die hard for companies looking more innocently to roll the past forward without realizing it is in danger of imposing historical limitations on new opportunities and tools. Thus, the result is not genuine modernization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-282971011"&gt;The Voice of the SAP Integration Suite Consultant: You’re the Strategic Bridge&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;A highly experience Integration Consultant—either in a senior role or that of an expert one—needs to have full knowledge of the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) integration suite Event Mesh (EM), Enterprise Assessment Management (EAM), API Management (APIM), Integration Assessment (IA) and Cloud Integration (CPI). But such technical proficiency is only the beginning. If you want to add value, then we need to do more than just drive “tickets” or be used as a “delivery“ service, not only SAP CPI developer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What you think about SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultant ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-86457506"&gt;Apart from SAP PO: Migration to SAP CPI or Migrating the Legacy (Snap Logic, Boomi, MuleSoft, Informatica, Microsoft etc.)&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;With middleware, many companies find themselves managing a hodgepodge of technologies. The 1,000 interfaces that need to be migrated from the likes of Snap Logic, MuleSoft, Informatica, Dell Boomi or webMethods to SAP BTP – SAP Integration Suite is not simply a question of technical mapping; it’s actually a functional exercise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Think of migration from SAP PI/PO to CPI. How many of you've seen flows with mapping layers having tons of UDF's, field-field mappings assigning to lots of standard functions (remove context, collapse context &amp;amp; rely on it), Conditional operators and Java mapping (as well) or Adapter module performing entirely different job.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;When dealing with such intricate mappings and modules, typically when you run the SAP Migration Assessment your migration status may be "non-migratable." Another point of consideration is that even if a&amp;nbsp; integration consultant has the skills to migrate these interfaces, do you really want them reverse engineering extracting prodcution payloads and manually testing for so long just to validate the results?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Furthermore, where is the documentation? Is the developer of this interface already gone?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Instead of looking at migration exclusively, it perhaps makes more sense to look rebuilding and examining the interfaces using native capabilities within SAP Integration Suite. Some of them could be transformed to events, others may become simple APIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;If the move from SAP PI/PO to SAP CPI is daunting, it’s even trickier when you have third-party interfaces in the mix. The details of such migrations can certainly complicate matters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_1-1767872347932.png" style="width: 863px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359363iA47D0ADBC315C97E/image-dimensions/863x574/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="863" height="574" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1767872347932.png" alt="rhviana_1-1767872347932.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 2: SAP Integration Consultants&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-19026720"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dismantling the Frankenstein Architecture in case of Multiples Platforms&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Int4 Suite (previously known as Int4 IFTT/Shield) is a test automation and service virtualization tool designed specifically for SAP ecosystems. It acts as an “accelerator” to dismantle the Frankenstein architecture and simplify complex migrations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767876653433.png" style="width: 852px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359417i8A394215EBA945BC/image-dimensions/852x564/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="852" height="564" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767876653433.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767876653433.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 3 – Dismantling the Frankenstein Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Functional regression is the biggest challenge when changing from SAP PI/PO to BTP. Testing convoluted, undocumented legacy mappings may appear to be testing hell—but it need not be.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Virtualization: Test Without Limits&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Int4 Shield "feels" the behaviour of external systems from within APIM itself. And since this is possible, you guessed it also can we make against SAP BTP E2E full flows, even if the backend does not yet exist.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No More Reverse Engineering&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Quit spending weekends trying to decode obsolescent Java mappings, User Defined Functions (UDFs) with no documentation. Instead of building these factors by hand, Int4 Shield uses the Comparison Approach:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automated Extraction :&lt;/STRONG&gt; Securely captures real production messages to make a "test case repository."&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Parallel Execution:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The old PI/PO mapping and the new BTP mapping are executed in parallel by this tool.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatic comparison:&lt;/STRONG&gt; for a penny or to the last character – Int4 shield checks each single difference and shows where logic diverges.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Massive Resource Savings&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The demand of manual testing is also greatly decreased by comparing with the real-world data as ground truth.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduce manual testing efforts up to 80%.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Test hundreds of scenarios in minutes, not weeks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Remove paperwork barriers: If the output matches, the logic works.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-169767572"&gt;Take apart the Frankenstein SAP PI/PO mappings and others&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The tool Figaf has these integration challenges in mind. The Figaf DevOps Suite, especially the Migration Edition, is built for the integration layer and has become the favored option when it comes to moving off SAP PI/PO and into the SAP Integration Suite (BTP).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;It is not a "generic" migration tool for all non-SAP external systems, like legacy databases and non-SAP ERP systems), but it supp (where integration flows connect those external systems with the SAP world).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767860556941.png" style="width: 834px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359268i158111B621741754/image-dimensions/834x542/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="834" height="542" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767860556941.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767860556941.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 4 - Figaf migration SAP PI/PO&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--26745933"&gt;Figaf: Focus and Capabilities&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figaf is a key component to DevOps and migration projects beyond the simple movement of code, as legacy logic is transformed into the modern Business Technology Platform (BTP) environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatic Migration&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The system automatically migrates PI/PO ICOs to iFlows, making the migration easy and allowing you to execute the migration flexibly with respect to architecture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Translation to Predicate Logic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Figaf skillfully converts complex Java and Mapping User-Defined Functions (UDFs) into Groovy scripts that adhere to BTP guidelines, so that legacy system functionalities are maintained in the transition to novel environments.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lifecycle Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: The set of tools consists of transport management, Git versioning and automatic documentation that covers the missing parts in the standard SAP BTP service.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Focus:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Figaf is designed for SAP PI/PO, the SAP Integration Suite (CPI) and API Management which provides a clear focus on integration problems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-70143569"&gt;RISE with SAP and Clean Core: Integration Must Not Be Forgotten&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;RISE with SAP is about more than transitioning to S/4HANA; it’s a fantastic time to eliminate historical sources of waste.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Classic Clean Core approach as it has been seen until now, for the most part only attacking the backend and identifying archived code that uses older ABAP "Z" code combined with customer modifications. This is necessary, but only a part of the meta-morphosis. Refining the backend result without the integration layer is a partial transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--419772943"&gt;Why "Clean Integration" Matters:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Suite as a Filter:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP BTP – which includes API Management, Event Mesh, Integration Advisor and Cloud Integration - is designed to keep your core stable. This suite helps put the ugliness in its place - far away from your backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Not Embracing the “Frankenstein” Anti-Pattern : Depending on miscellaneous external tools to enrich the inbuilt capability violates the ethos of a Clean Core. These are the sorts of practices that drive "borrowed architectures" which gradually acquire technical debt over time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to Future-Proof Your Systems:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A standard core demands a standard connection. If you don’t Integrate Clean, you’re likely just putting off big problems for another day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A Clean Core and a Messy Integration Layer cannot both exist. That’s crucial no matter how you currently are reevaluating 20 to 30 years of ECC custom code; it is just as necessary for the manner through which your systems will get linked.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_1-1767606669435.png" style="width: 802px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358119iD5533A3972D0A8F5/image-dimensions/802x534/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="802" height="534" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1767606669435.png" alt="rhviana_1-1767606669435.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 5 – Rise and Clean core backend plus Integration refactoring&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--616286448"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The intention of this post was to start a conversation between integration developers such as me. Note – this is not a discussion around the various other systems that help you run-the-business. Rather, my interest lies purely with the type of features that SAP BTP Integration Suite has relative to other industry-leading platforms in a similar space.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;I wanted to take a deeper look, with closer readers at trade-offs from within the space of API Management (APIM), Event Management (EM), Application Event Management (AEM), SAP Integration Advisor ( IA ) and Cloud Platform Integration (CPI).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This study is conducted to expand our knowledge and understanding of how overlapping functionalities should be addressed in a modern, homogeneous integration architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the end the decision is from the Integration Architecture responsable, because he must make all the checks between the plataforms and see what can be done with SAP BTP Integration Suite against others plataforms overlapping the services where you can focous in the homogeneos landscape with SAP BTP IS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Viana.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Accessing SAP Cloud Integration (SAP CI)&amp;nbsp;information programmatically has become quite common today.&lt;BR /&gt;Whether it’s iFlows, message processing logs, or deployed artifacts, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CI OData APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt; make this information easily available, all we need is &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;technical user&lt;/STRONG&gt; with the right roles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This convenience often raises a natural question:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2045868504"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Can we do the same for SAP BTP as well?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Can we programmatically access:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP BTP account details ?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Subaccounts and entitlements ?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Services and runtime information ?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The answer is &lt;STRONG&gt;Yes,&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;but unlike SAP CI, the authentication and access model for &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Core Services&lt;/STRONG&gt; is fundamentally different.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1720272280"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why SAP BTP Is Different from SAP CI?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;When accessing &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CI OData APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, authentication is straightforward:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use an SAP CI technical user&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Assign the required roles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Call the OData endpoint&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, SAP BTP Core Services APIs (Accounts, Entitlements, Directories, etc.) do not work this way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;cannot&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use SAP CI technical users&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use basic authentication&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Directly call these APIs without a management service&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;SAP BTP protects these APIs using OAuth 2.0 and requires a dedicated management service to act as a trusted client.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;And this is exactly where the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Management Service (CIS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; comes into play.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523758775"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introducing SAP Cloud Management Service (CIS)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To access &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Core Services APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP mandates the use of: &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Management Service – CIS plan&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CIS acts as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;An authorized OAuth client&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A secure gateway to SAP BTP management APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The mechanism through which access tokens are issued for Core Services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once CIS is configured, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;can securely access SAP BTP Core Services APIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1327245270"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create SAP Cloud Management Service Instance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;BTP Cockpit --&amp;gt;

follow a different and more secure access model. These APIs are protected using OAuth 2.0 and require the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Management Service (CIS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; as the authorized gateway.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once CIS is configured, consuming SAP BTP Core Services APIs from SAP Cloud Integration becomes seamless, enabling automation, governance, and platform-level insights. Understanding this distinction is essential for designing robust and future-ready integration scenarios on SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cheers,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Punith&lt;/P&gt;</content>

No theory overload. Just usable guidance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’ll also look at familiar scenarios: converting SAP Analytics Cloud or SAP Datasphere customers, modernizing SAP BW, and positioning SAP BDC within SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition or the broader SAP Business Suite. The goal? &amp;nbsp;Help you move faster and sell with confidence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you work in sales, presales, or solution design, this session will save you time—and a few headaches—on your next deal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt; Register now and secure your spot.&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/education/psd/2025/jul/e_oe_te_w_PSD_WEB_00010688.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/education/psd/2025/jul/e_oe_te_w_PSD_WEB_00010688.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;#SAP #SAPBTP #SAPPartners #SAPBusinessDataCloud #SAPSales #SAPEcosystem&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Welcome to my second post in the series for ABAPers venturing into the wild world of BTP!&lt;BR /&gt;If you missed the first one, check it out here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/git-grit-giggle-and-no-rest-my-sap-learning-curve-with-bumps/ba-p/14270971" target="_blank"&gt;Git, Grit, Giggle and no REST: My SAP Learning Curve (with Bumps!)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you’re learning something new, teachers (or native speakers) love to say:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“Don’t use translations when learning a language”&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;“Don’t rely on stickers to learn piano notes”&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Easy for them to say!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When I started learning a second language, I translated everything — and it helped me big time. Now, after years of practice, I don’t need it anymore, and yes, I agree translation isn’t ideal. But that’s now, after years of fluency (and since my second language is English, feel free to judge me).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then I started learning piano… and guess what? I cannot do it without stickers. They guide me, make things easier, and slowly my brain gets used to not needing them. Imagine hearing a sound and magically knowing where you are when you just started? Laughable! It comes with time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So yes, I think of BTP like ABAP. Sue me! I make silly analogies — baking cakes for new technology, comparing tools to houses it helps me SO MUCH. And I’m here to share them with you, in case your brain works like mine. Tip: I always ask AI to give me analogies when I can’t understand something.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-container"&gt;&lt;a class="lia-spoiler-link" href="#" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;noscript&gt; (Highlight to read)&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-border"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-content"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/STRONG&gt; So far, I’ve only used a bit of BTP and created a foreground app. This post won’t cover everything, just the key concepts that matter to me so far.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-container"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-content"&gt;DISCLAIMER: So far, I’ve only used a bit of BTP and created a foreground app. This post won’t cover everything, just the key concepts that matter to me so far.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s start with the analogies and new tools!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1787710912"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BTP World in House Terms&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;TABLE width="929px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tool&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is it?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Think of it as…&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new world&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of BTP as the entire infrastructure of a city. Roads, electricity, water — everything that makes life possible. It’s not just one thing; it’s the platform where all your services, connectivity, and solutions live. Without BTP, nothing else exists. It’s the foundation of your new cloud life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BAS&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your new home&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where you’ll spend most of your time. BAS (Business Application Studio) is your cozy new home for development. It comes with tools, templates, and wizards that &lt;EM&gt;pretend&lt;/EM&gt; to make life easier (spoiler: they will, but not on day one). At first, you’ll feel like you moved into a smart home with lots of buttons and no manual.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Eclipse&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your old house&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The old house you still visit because you haven’t fully moved yet. It’s familiar, it works, but it’s not cloud-connected and definitely not the future. You’ll keep it around for a while, like that old sofa you can’t throw away yet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Approuter&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Gate and Reception&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine a fancy gated community. Approuter is the gatekeeper, &amp;nbsp;it welcomes guests, checks their identity, and directs them to the right place. No unauthorized visitors allowed. It’s all about routing and security.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;XSUAA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Security system&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of XSUAA as your smart alarm system. It makes sure strangers don’t get in and your house stays safe. Authentication and authorization? That’s its job.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HTML5 App&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The living room&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where the family gathers. Your users will spend time here, interacting with the app in harmony (hopefully). It’s the visible part of your home — the UI that everyone sees.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The kitchen&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’re Latin, you know the kitchen is the heart of the house. It’s where the magic happens — the backend logic, the database connections, the heavy lifting. Guests don’t see the mess; they just enjoy the delicious food (your app’s features). CAP is that kitchen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MTAR file&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The moving truck&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you move houses, you need a truck to carry everything. MTAR is that truck. It bundles all parts of your app and delivers them to the new place so users can consume it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="93px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;RAP app&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="104px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The futuristic building&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="732px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Picture a modern glass building with IoT gadgets everywhere — that’s RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming Model). It’s sleek, cloud-ready, and the future of ABAP development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1591197407"&gt;And now the ABAP analogies&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;TABLE width="921px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tool&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;What is it?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;In ABAP or analogy&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;MVC&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Model&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;View&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Controller&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Models – In BTP, this is your data layer. In ABAP, think internal tables and SELECT statements — the place where data lives.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;View – Easy — the screen. Dynpro, ALV, or even a SmartForm. What the user sees.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Controller – The logic that glues it all together. In ABAP reports, that’s your event blocks like START-OF-SELECTION and END-OF-SELECTION. In OO ABAP, it’s your methods orchestrating the flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Manifest.json&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The route&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This file is the brain of your app. It tells where to go, when, and how.&lt;BR /&gt;In ABAP terms? Think of the master program in a Function Group — the one that knows all the paths and controls the flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;CSS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Styles&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP doesn’t really have CSS (oh, the UX pain we’ve endured!). The closest thing? Smart Styles in SmartForms but easier.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;I18N&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Translation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;In BTP, I18N handles translations. In ABAP, that’s like text elements or the language-dependent texts you maintain for reports and screens.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Package.json&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;List of dependencies&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;This file lists all the libraries and modules your app needs.&lt;BR /&gt;In ABAP, the closest analogy is the where-used list or even the package structure that shows dependencies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;YAML&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Destination&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;YAML files define destinations and connectivity in BTP.&lt;BR /&gt;In ABAP, think RFC destinations in SM59 — the way you tell the system where to connect.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="112.969px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;GitHub and GitLab&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="162.906px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Versioning&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="644.125px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;In ABAP, that’s like transport requests. And if you use CHARM? Even better — Git feels like CHARM on steroids. You commit (save), push (release)…&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’re an ABAPer stepping into BTP, I hope these analogies make things a little less scary and a lot more fun. They work for me because my brain loves shortcuts and silly comparisons — maybe yours does too.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Of course, this is just scratching the surface. It’s only the beginning of the journey. I’m still learning. I will get there, someway, somehow. I hope!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since I am learning I would love your feedback! Did I get it right? Anything to add or change? Drop your thoughts in the comments — let’s make this cloud adventure easier together!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Let's take a quick look through the highlights. But before we do, let's check out the new FEATURE STATUS BADGES that are appearing more and more - in fact, there are a few in the notes for this release.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;As we all know our Greek alphabet, we can correctly surmise that while BETA features are post-experimental and still possibly subject to change ... GAMMA features, not to be confused with the type of radiation that created The Incredible Hulk, are pretty much finalised and ready to use &amp;amp; test thoroughly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;00;44;22 - 00;01;19;15&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Two such features that are at GAMMA level in this release are Status-Transition Flows and Declarative Constraints.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;We covered Status-Transition Flows in a previous news item for the previous release, and there's an overview in this blog post we have for you.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;So let's instead take a brief look at the super exciting Declarative Constraints. There are new possibilities with the @assert annotation to define complex constraints, in your CDS model.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;01;19;18 - 00;01;50;01&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That's right, declaratively. We should always strive to PUSH outwards, pushing logic up into the declarative model, and queries &amp;amp; data manipulation down to the database, which goes hand in hand with CAP’s axiom WHAT NOT HOW.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The conditions are expressed in another domain specific language in CDS - CXL - CDS Expression Language.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;01;50;01 - 00;02;19;07&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And, almost as if we'd planned it, there’s a new Hands-on SAP Dev live stream series on CXL starting Friday next week, with me and one of the fab members of the CAP compiler team, Patrice. Don't miss it!&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;CAP’s support for hierarchical tree views has just become a lot more streamlined, with a new @hierarchy annotation replacing a ton of OData specific ones.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;02;19;08 - 00;02;46;26&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now that's what I call simple reuse, and cap is an incredibly important idea and a best practice to add in that context. There's a new command CDS export, with which you can create API client packages from your CDS service. Definitions. The output is a full featured cap reuse package that can be published to and pulled from npm registries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;02;46;29 - 00;03;15;23&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now that’s what I call simple.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Reuse in CAP is an incredibly important idea, and best practice too, and in that context, there’s a new command cds export with which you can create API client packages from your CDS service definitions; the output is a full-featured CAP reuse package that can be published to and pulled from NPM registries. If exporting via EDMX is the lossy MP3 audio format, then cds export gives us a lossless transfer, more like FLAC.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;By the way, if you're interested to learn more about reuse in CAP, with NPM packages, we've a new blog post series Modules, modularity &amp;amp; reuse in CDS models which you might be interested in, with parts 1 and 2 already published.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;03;15;26 - 00;03;45;29&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the CDS Language &amp;amp; Compiler topic, there's an enhancement that will appeal to those of you who develop and serve multiple frontends from the app/ directory. Now CDS file content from all ./app/* subdirectories will be fetched and loaded (say, with cds build or cds serve) instead of just from the app/ directory itself. This means we don't have to use an index.cds file in the app/ directory to import what we need.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;03;46;01 - 00;04;19;26&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Staying in the CDS Language &amp;amp; Compiler area, there's another enhancement that allows us to use symbols not only for enums defined in CDS, but now also for enums in OData annotations. The example in the release notes in Capire is great, because not only does it illustrate the enhancement, but it also causes the curious amongst us to use our brains and go to find out where the relation between 1 and Readonly, and between 7 and Mandatory, is defined.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;04;19;26 - 00;04;51;01&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And of course it's in OData's “Common” vocabulary, contributed by SAP.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the Node.js runtime topic, it is now possible to make direct CRUD requests on draft-enabled entities; for example, instead of the EDIT-PATCH-SAVE sequence, you can now just send a direct UPDATE request.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Also, event queue processing has been consolidated into a default queue ... and custom queues, and there has been a change to the db-related guarantee, from ‘at least once’ to ‘exactly once’.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;04;51;01 - 00;05;23;03&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Related guarantee from at least once to exactly once. Finally, in the NodeJS runtime topic, there has been some cleanup of the model reflection APIs. Some function uses have been deprecated and the text entities are now available in a text property of the corresponding localized entity. Moving to the Java runtime topic, there are some important changes related to deep updates for draft enabled entities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;05;23;06 - 00;05;52;09&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally in the Node.js runtime topic, there has been some clean up of the model reflection APIs. Some function usages have been deprecated, and the .texts entities are now available in a texts property of the corresponding localised entity.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the Java runtime, there are some important changes related to deep updates for draft-enabled entities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;05;52;11 - 00;06;23;25&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, as well as support for active entities, there’s also deep update support for inactive entities too, as long as the keys are included.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Additionally, there’s a new as(String alias) method on the CqnValue interface; with that, it’s possible to create aliased values directly, making it easier to build queries with aliased values.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the Tools topic, there’s a Kyma convenience now for the cds up command; if your project contains Helm deployment resources, and no mta.yaml file, then you don't need to specify the --to k8s option explicitly any more.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;And last but not least, in the Plugins topic, the Node.js plugin &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1862993"&gt;@SAP&lt;/a&gt;/cds-rfc now supports multitenancy.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;There are links to everything I've mentioned, and more ... in the description.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;06;23;27 - 00;06;45;04&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post, Simona reflects on how 2025 laid the groundwork for AI powered ABAP development and gives us a clear line of sight into where things are going in 2026. One big highlight from the blogpost is that Joule for developers will remain free for another year, giving us more time to explore AI assisted coding in real projects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;06;45;07 - 00;07;15;00&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The blog post walks us through the evolution of AI last year and what's to come. Smart tooling with the AI workflow, deeper integration with VS code, and a renowned focus on custom code migration using AI, all designed to help developers be more productive and modernize their code bases. And that's really the strategy going into 2020. Shipping early, scaling smart, and keeping the ABAP core clean in 2025 is about unlocking what I can do.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;07;15;07 - 00;07;22;12&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then 2026 will make ABAP AI the core of AI about development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;07;22;15 - 00;07;54;05&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Q4 2025 release of SAP HANA Cloud brings many updates designed to streamline your workflow and unlock new possibilities. Let’s dive into what’s new.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Let's start with SAP HANA Cloud Central, which now supports background processing for long-running SQL statements that continue even after closing your browser. A new consolidated view of HDI schemas and containers provides quick access to HDI artifacts and their metadata.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;07;54;08 - 00;08;36;26&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business Data Cloud integration is streamlined—data products are automatically exposed as virtual tables, reducing manual setup and accelerating data reuse.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Calculation view modeling adds column lineage via SQL table functions, dynamic input parameters for MDS cube conversions, and runtime-evaluated restricted columns. Joins are enhanced with support for left outer joins in star joins.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This release introduces the ability to transform property graphs into semantic knowledge graphs without requiring redesign of data models, enabling flexible switching between paradigms on the same data for your use cases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;08;36;28 - 00;09;10;09&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For developers and data scientists, AI and machine learning capabilities have undergone significant enhancements. The new Unified Time Series procedure provides a consistent interface across algorithms, simplifying development. Text embedding models have been improved to reduce output dimensions without sacrificing accuracy, and the new cross and convert model. In an NLP service ensures more precise search results. Ranking with the Hana Experiment Monitor user interface.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;09;10;11 - 00;09;34;05&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The final SAP CodeJam of 2025 took place in Istanbul, with a focus on AI in SAP HANA Cloud. The next one will happen in February in Berlin, and rest assured, it will be updated with some of these cool new enhancements. You can request this CodeJam topic in your location also!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;09;34;08 - 00;09;38;22&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also see all the.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;09;38;25 - 00;10;08;14&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why not start the year off right? With the cleanest, safest applications you can. That's what the new application vulnerability report service for on SAP. BTP focuses on Cloud Foundry applications. Is exactly for this new service. Now in beta will allow you to scan your running applications on SAP, BTP on a regular basis and look for critical vulnerabilities. Don't wait until something happens to one of your applications to find out that there's a vulnerability in it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;10;08;16 - 00;10;31;19&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Be proactive and find out in advance. So I encourage you to check out this brand new service. I'll put the link to the blog post that describes it, as well as goes through the setup process. It's very easy to use and you can start getting your reports today, so I would encourage you to do so.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;10;31;22 - 00;11;00;19&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So my bedroom. So I hear that there were the two of us and have got a special leftovers right, to work with the community that long. You know what you want, right? Nope. There was kind of a learning journey that you did. Yeah. Our bosses always incentive us to look forward. And WhatsApp has to offer. Even if we don't do work on it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;11;00;21 - 00;11;22;13&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's not right. But if you know it, and that exists once the opportunity arrives, you already know it, then you can hit the ground running. Yeah. That's fantastic. So basically, as part of this learning journey, studying your cell phone, it's a party that you took part in. Definitely. Yeah. So what was your favorite aspect of that for week?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;11;22;15 - 00;11;52;13&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yeah. I think, seeing the videos, making the quizzes, I was amazed with Joe. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. That's really cool. So did you manage to attend any of the videos live, or are you watching? Sort of, recording? Nope. I had done both. That's dedication. That's real dedication. The journey was only, to learn. We have, a few months just learning and doing things.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;11;52;15 - 00;12;18;14&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yeah. Yeah. But in terms of, you know, what? What motivates you to keep doing. What is it? What's the secret? I think I'm a person that really wants to know more every time and keep searching and work for we can do. And, how can we automate our work? The aims, I think the I think it was all about that shit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;00;12;18;15 - 00;12;31;06&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Oh, yeah. Yeah. How can we make our develop life better? Easier? And also curiosity driving. We got to learn. That's why I think that's the best definition of what developed. Yeah. Pedro, thanks very much. Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

But here’s the reality.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;if they don’t work together, your architecture is going to break sooner or later.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Growth is uncomfortable, moving away from just "configure adapters, fixing errors and create mappings" to actually thinking about strategy is tough, but you have to do it if you don't want to get stuck in the "trap" mindset.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Carl Jung once said: “Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakens.”&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the world of SAP BTP Integration Suite, if you only look at the "outside" - All they perceive is an illusion of integration you are merely dreaming of a perfect integration, but that dream won't survive longer with the digital integration transformation to truly &lt;STRONG&gt;"awaken"&lt;/STRONG&gt; as an SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultants, you must look &lt;STRONG&gt;inside&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;at integrations and the components they join in a more profound level. This in-depth knowledge results in more consistent and less brittle integrations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523730816"&gt;The "General" vs. The "Soldier" (A quick story)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me show you a imaginare conversation conversation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The following dialogue illustrates a common situation in integration projects when API Management is treated as an afterthought instead of an architectural capability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767912334527.png" style="width: 183px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359548iA864F83C5F738CDA/image-dimensions/183x251/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="183" height="251" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767912334527.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767912334527.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We need to migrate 40 APIs from an old platform to SAP BTP APIM, after deep analyses of polices and others comparing with other vendors. we are good to go.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;How should we handle this ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_1-1767912334528.png" style="width: 209px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359549iE7FF3CA1096A18B4/image-dimensions/209x242/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="209" height="242" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1767912334528.png" alt="rhviana_1-1767912334528.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI Developer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Easy. I’ll just build the iFlows in CPI, set up the HTTPS endpoints, and maybe throw in some Basic Auth or OAuth inside the flow. If something fails, I’ll set up an email alert.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_2-1767912334529.png" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359550iB8BD7732D366185B/image-dimensions/200x275/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="200" height="275" role="button" title="rhviana_2-1767912334529.png" alt="rhviana_2-1767912334529.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Okay... but what if a partner starts spamming our endpoint with 10x more traffic by mistake?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is CPI going to tank that hit directly?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Who’s controlling the gate?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Response - (Awkward silence)&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_3-1767912334530.png" style="width: 220px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359551i974EDDB2B48B02E3/image-dimensions/220x272/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="220" height="272" role="button" title="rhviana_3-1767912334530.png" alt="rhviana_3-1767912334530.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP - Integration Suite Consultant&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Hold on. We are not trading URLs here; we need to position SAP APIM as the defense in depth. It is our immune defense.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We will control the rate limiting and security policy within APIM so no request will get into CPI if not satisfy our requirements.

In a clean integration setup, APIM helps control &lt;STRONG&gt;who can access APIs, how traffic is handled, and how contracts are defined&lt;/STRONG&gt;, protecting SAP CPI and backend systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Going beyond a CPI-only mindset does not mean changing your role overnight. It means &lt;STRONG&gt;understanding where each tool fits&lt;/STRONG&gt; and using the right capability for the right responsibility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP API Management is not about copying URLs from one platform to another. It is about &lt;STRONG&gt;setting clear boundaries&lt;/STRONG&gt; so SAP CPI can focus on integration logic, while APIM takes care of security and traffic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;STRONG&gt;Part II&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we will move to&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/sap-btp-is-how-to-become-a-sap-integration-suite-consultant-beyond-sap-cpi/ba-p/14303996" target="_self"&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;event-driven integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Viana.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-19053562"&gt;References to study&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--417011600"&gt;References links compilation:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/group.cp-apim-code-1.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Get Started with API Management&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/developing-with-sap-integration-suite" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Developing with SAP Integration Suite -

Today we are going to talk about&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)&lt;/STRONG&gt; using &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Event Mesh (EM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced Event Mesh (AEM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This is the first of four posts (the last one a summary because I will not explain SAP CPI, I'm expect that you know already), and we will navigate you through how to stop being “SAP CPI Developer” and become an SAP Integration Suite Consultant - "Generals".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Second we will start with&lt;SPAN&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Event Mesh (EM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced Event Mesh (AEM).&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sun Tzu once said: "In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity."&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In our world, logistics is how we handle data flow. If you are simply connecting dots, you are creating disorder. But when you leverage the synergy of the entire Suite—especially the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp;Event Mesh (EM/AEM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;—you finally bring order to the chaos or stantard events or custom events over the event-driven architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1720281121"&gt;The "General" vs. The "Soldier" (A quick story)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me show you a imaginare conversation conversation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The following dialogue illustrates a common situation in integration projects when SAP BTP EM/AEM is treated as an afterthought instead of an architectural capability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" style="width: 158px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359438iB6A2E203DD0429E3/image-dimensions/158x218/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="158" height="218" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our client is already using SAP standard events and custom events for others process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For critical processes, we can’t afford to lose messages or have the S/4HANA tied up during maintenance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We need a clean, resilient design.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How do we test this with SAP Event Mesh and SAP Advanced Event Mesh before moving to custom events?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767914540473.png" style="width: 193px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359556iF175B063638C8669/image-dimensions/193x232/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="193" height="232" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767914540473.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767914540473.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI Developer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Honestly... I’m a bit scared of that. I don't really get how Pub-Sub or Topics work. EDA sounds way too complex. Can’t we just keep it simple? The partner calls my CPI endpoint via HTTPS, I try to post to SAP, and if it fails, I’ll just trigger an error email or a basic retry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" style="width: 162px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359438iB6A2E203DD0429E3/image-dimensions/162x223/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="162" height="223" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767879482710.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;I get the fear. But in an event-driven world, control doesn’t disappear—it just shifts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Event Mesh becomes our safety net. The partner publishes, the broker holds the message, and CPI/S4 only consumes it when they’re ready. If S/4 is offline, the message doesn't die.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We don't kill the CPI with retries..&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;(Awkward silence)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_3-1767880643166.png" style="width: 187px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359448iCBE9CECA4DED323F/image-dimensions/187x231/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="187" height="231" role="button" title="rhviana_3-1767880643166.png" alt="rhviana_3-1767880643166.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP - Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;I get the concern, but in an event-driven world, control doesn’t disappear—it shifts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The Event Mesh becomes our safety net. The partner publishes, the broker holds the message, and CPI/S4 only consumes it when ready.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;If S/4 is offline, the message doesn't die. We stop killing the CPI with retries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Let’s run a PoC with standard events first to prove the resilience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523767616"&gt;Final Proposal: SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you move to Event Mesh, you aren't just changing an endpoint. You’re redefining where the "safety" happens.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standard SAP Events → SAP Event Mesh:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Native, simple, and perfect for the SAP ecosystem.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom/Multi-platform Events → Advanced Event Mesh (AEM):&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is for the heavy lifting—more protocols, more capacity, and massive decoupling.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Stop guessing with Pub-Sub:&lt;/STRONG&gt; We don't throw messages into the dark. The producer publishes, the broker saves it, and CPI subscribes only when it’s ready.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Kill the fear of losing data:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In a synchronous world, a crash kills the message. With AEM (AMQP), that message sits there safely until it's processed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1001621087" id="toc-hId-1327254111"&gt;Charting New Responsibilities on the possible migration from external vendors: Who Does What?&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;To witness the transformation from Soldier - SAP CPI&amp;nbsp;to General - SAP BTP Integration Suite Developer, one must reconfigure their mindset, gain governance experience, and, most importantly, understand the clear boundaries of authority for each role.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1130740606"&gt;Integration Architect&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the person who draws the "road map." When migrating from an external broker, they ensure the architecture isn't just a "copy and paste" job.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Messaging Patterns:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Decides how to translate patterns from the old broker to SAP (e.g., transforming a RabbitMQ "Exchange" into "Topics" and "Queues" in AEM).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Topic Strategy:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defines the Topic Hierarchy (Taxonomy). In AEM, this is vital for enabling intelligent routing and message filtering.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Payload Definition (CloudEvents):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Encourages the use of the &lt;STRONG&gt;CloudEvents&lt;/STRONG&gt; standard so that events remain platform-agnostic, facilitating future scalability.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Global Error Handling:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defines the &lt;STRONG&gt;Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)&lt;/STRONG&gt; policy. If an event fails within SAP, where does it go? How is it reprocessed?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-934227101"&gt;Solution Architect&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Solution Architect doesn't just look at the code; they look at how the broker fits into the corporate ecosystem and the budget.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tool Selection (EM vs. AEM):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Decides whether the scenario requires the standard &lt;STRONG&gt;Event Mesh&lt;/STRONG&gt; (native, simple, S/4HANA events) or &lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced Event Mesh&lt;/STRONG&gt; (high volume, multi-cloud, complex protocols like MQTT/Solace).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Continuity:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defines SLAs. If the previous broker offered global redundancy, they ensure AEM delivers the same level of resilience.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TCO Analysis (Total Cost of Ownership):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Evaluates the cost of data egress from external brokers versus the savings of keeping traffic within the SAP BTP backbone.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security &amp;amp; Governance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defines how identities (OAuth, certificates) will be migrated to ensure only authorized systems publish or subscribe to events.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-737713596"&gt;SAP BTP Integration Consultant&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the person with hands-on expertise (EM, AEM) who ensures the data flow never stops.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Protocol Mapping:&lt;/STRONG&gt; If the legacy broker used JMS and SAP EM uses REST/AMQP, they configure the adapters and protocol bridges.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Event Mesh/AEM Configuration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Creates the Queues, Topic Subscriptions, and manages the Bridges between different data centers or clouds.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consumer Implementation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Within SAP Integration Suite (CPI), they configure iFlows to be "Event-Driven." Instead of polling for data, they set up Webhooks or AMQP senders to react instantly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Performance &amp;amp; Throttling:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Ensures the flow from AEM doesn't "overwhelm" the S/4HANA backend by configuring concurrency limits and backpressure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Migration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Executes the Cutover plan. They handle moving pending messages from the old broker to the new one without loss or duplication.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper

pro means knowing that &lt;STRONG&gt;CPI is not a shock absorber.&lt;/STRONG&gt; Using Event Mesh or AEM is how you build a system that can actually handle the "real world events" (where systems go offline and things break).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the next part III, we’ll talk about the monst complex one, we are going to speak with T-REX

Today, we’re going deeper into &lt;/SPAN&gt;are going to talk about &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Advisor.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This is the third of four posts (the last one a summary because I will not explain SAP CPI, I'm expect that you know already), and we will navigate you through how to stop being “SAP CPI Developer” and become an SAP Integration Suite Consultant - "Generals".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Isaac Asimov once said: "The self-evident is that which is not seen until someone expresses it simply."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the world of B2B EDI, we have spent years overcomplicating the obvious with endless manual mappings. The SAP Integration Advisor is what finally expresses that complexity with simplicity. A "General" does not waste time redesigning what has already been standardized; instead, they leverage collective intelligence to focus on what truly matters: business strategy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1720302010"&gt;The "General" vs. The "Soldier" (A quick story)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let me show you a imaginare conversation conversation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The following dialogue illustrates a common situation in integration projects when SAP BTP Integration Advisor is treated as an afterthought instead of an architectural capability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_8-1767907321493.png" style="width: 143px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359539i58825F304639EF1D/image-dimensions/143x197/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="143" height="197" role="button" title="rhviana_8-1767907321493.png" alt="rhviana_8-1767907321493.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="50%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our next big challenge is B2B EDI migration from external platform on a global scale. We are dealing with 50 international partners using a literal 'alphabet soup' of standards:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;specific variants of EDIFACT, ANSI X12, VDA for the automotive sector, and even RosettaNet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;How do you plan to maintain governance over these mappings and ensure the support team doesn't get lost in a labyrinth of custom code and outdated Excel mapping sheets?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1767954099415.png" style="width: 189px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359707i14B408B311DE298D/image-dimensions/189x282/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="189" height="282" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1767954099415.png" alt="rhviana_0-1767954099415.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI Developer&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Well, it's a manual grind. I’ll open the CPI graphical editor for each partner and start 'connecting the strings' (mapping). If a global rule changes, I’ll go into every single iFlow and update them manually. It’s complex and tedious, but that’s how I’ve always done it in CPI.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_10-1767907321495.png" style="width: 174px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359542iC851D492F3413F0C/image-dimensions/174x240/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="174" height="240" role="button" title="rhviana_10-1767907321495.png" alt="rhviana_10-1767907321495.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enterprise Architect / Solution Architect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Manual only SAP CPI Iflows ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;That’s a compliance nightmare.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;What about documentation?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;What about industry standards ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;If you leave the project tomorrow, how will the next developer understand why field X was mapped to field Y specifically for partner number 32?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We can't scale a business on 'tribal knowledge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;(Awkward silence)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_11-1767907321496.png" style="width: 193px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359544i93575778C9F4462F/image-dimensions/193x238/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="193" height="238" role="button" title="rhviana_11-1767907321496.png" alt="rhviana_11-1767907321496.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP - Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;You’re right. CPI alone wasn't built to manage &lt;STRONG&gt;business semantics&lt;/STRONG&gt; at scale.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is exactly where the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Advisor (IA)&lt;/STRONG&gt; comes in.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We stop acting like 'manual mappers' and start acting like architects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By using IA, we leverage crowd-sourced AI to generate MIG's automated Mapping Guidelines (MAGs) that are standardized, the EDI contract in the TPM and self-documenting, and easy to maintain across all 50 partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1523788505"&gt;Final Proposal: SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governance via MIGs (Message Implementation Guidelines):&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is where business semantics become law. Instead of the developer arbitrarily deciding what a field represents, we create &lt;STRONG&gt;MIGs&lt;/STRONG&gt; under the Architect’s supervision. The Architect defines the company’s &lt;STRONG&gt;'Golden Standard'&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensuring standardized fields and precise semantic descriptions. Structural governance is centralized within the Advisor library, rather than being scattered across 50 different iFlows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Power of MAGs (Mapping Guidelines):&lt;/STRONG&gt; As a consultant, I use the Integration Advisor to generate &lt;STRONG&gt;MAGs&lt;/STRONG&gt; powered by Machine Learning. The IA suggests mappings based on collective intelligence—what the global ecosystem has already validated. This reduces manual effort by over 60%, ensuring that the "Golden Rule" comes from the official SAP library, not technical guesswork.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TPM (Trading Partner Management) as the Controller:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This is the true game-changer. The Architect acts as the &lt;STRONG&gt;Controller&lt;/STRONG&gt;, managing all partners within the &lt;STRONG&gt;TPM&lt;/STRONG&gt; portal. This is where we centralize contract registries, B2B agreements, and security certificates. In CPI, the developer simply consumes what has been governed in the TPM, ensuring total compliance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI as the Execution Middleware:&lt;/STRONG&gt; CPI acts as the engine that processes SAP’s &lt;STRONG&gt;Standard Pre-packaged Content (iFlows)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. To ensure the architecture is both resilient and extensible, we use CPI’s power for &lt;STRONG&gt;PRE or POST-mapping&lt;/STRONG&gt; manipulations. Whenever a MAG reaches its limits with complex mapping requirements, we intervene with &lt;STRONG&gt;Groovy scripts or XSLT&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This gives us the best of both worlds: the speed of IA automation and the total flexibility of code where it truly matters.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1327275000"&gt;Charting New Responsibilities in Migrations: Who Does What?&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The transformation from &lt;STRONG&gt;Soldier (SAP CPI Developer)&lt;/STRONG&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;General (SAP BTP Integration Suite Consultant)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, one must reconfigure their mindset, gain governance experience, and, most importantly, understand the clear boundaries of authority for each role. In a migration from external vendors of B2B EDI, success depends on knowing how SAP Integration Advisor works and how to import and configure the stantard Iflows for this type of integration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1130740606" id="toc-hId-1130761495"&gt;Integration Architect&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technology Analysis:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They evaluate the technical fit from external platform provides for EDI integration vs&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Advisor&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Communication Standards:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They check and analise the possibles protocols used for EDI's&amp;nbsp; (AMQP, MQTT, REST, AS2,AS4,VAN,API,OFTP2) and ensure they align with the SAP APIM e SAP CPI possibilities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-934247990"&gt;Solution Architect&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Migration Roadmap:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They define the phases of the migration and the ROI of moving to SAP BTP Integration Advisor + SAP CPI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Risk Management:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They verify if the migration complies with industry regulations and internal security policies.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Final Approval:&lt;/STRONG&gt; They authorize the "Golden Standards" that will be used across the entire suite.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-866817204"&gt;SAP BTP Integration Consultant&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is the person with hands-on expertise SAP Integration Advisor to support the bussiness on the creation of MIG and MAG's&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Execution (The Scope):&lt;/STRONG&gt; Their primary responsibility is the creation and optimization of &lt;STRONG&gt;MAGs (Mapping Guidelines)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensuring the engine (CPI) runs the business logic perfectly through iFlows if need extra logic apply groovy, or XSLT in duty of restrictions in MAG for complex logics&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Boundaries (Out of Scope):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; To maintain the integrity of the role, the following are &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;NOT&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; the sole responsibility of the Consultant, but rather corporate governance assets provided by the Architects:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governance Policies:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Defining the overall rules of engagement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIG Creation &amp;amp; Semantic Definitions:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The "Business Language" must be defined by the Architect/Business Owner.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Naming Conventions:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Global standards must be established at the architectural level.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TPM Registration:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Managing trading partner contracts and legal agreements is a business/governance function, not a developer task.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_1-1767950931242.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359668iA2CC79255F26C022/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1767950931242.png" alt="rhviana_1-1767950931242.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 1 - SAP Integration Suite Consultant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-541220980"&gt;Conclusion — Part III&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Being a "General" means realizing that &lt;STRONG&gt;standardization is your best weapon.&lt;/STRONG&gt; With the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Advisor&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you stop being a slave to manual mapping and start leading with architectural intelligence.

Maxwell&lt;/SPAN&gt;. Once said:&amp;nbsp;"A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way."&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP BTP - IS - How to become a SAP Integration Suite Consultant beyond SAP CPI - SAP APIM Part I&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We explored APIM as more than just a proxy layer. It is where traffic is controlled, abuse is blocked, and contracts are enforced.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;APIM is where:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Traffic is controlled&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Apply Policies PreFlow or PosFlow&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Abuse is blocked&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Contracts are enforced&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP CPI is protected from becoming a firewall&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key realization:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;If garbage reaches CPI, the architecture has already failed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/sap-btp-is-how-to-become-a-sap-integration-suite-consultant-beyond-sap-cpi/ba-p/14302203" target="_self"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Read Part I — SAP API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP BTP - IS - How to become a SAP Integration Suite Consultant beyond SAP CPI - SAP EM/AEM Part II&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We moved into Event-Driven Architecture. This is where systems stop blocking each other and downtime stops killing messages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Systems stop blocking each other&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Event-Driven Architecture&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;PubSub+&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Topic&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Queue&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Downtime stops killing messages&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key realization: &lt;/STRONG&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp;CPI is not a shock absorber.

We showed how to eliminate mapping chaos by centralizing business semantics with MIGs and scaling with MAGs and the governance using TPM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With SAP Integration Advisor, we showed how to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Eliminate manual mapping chaos&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Centralize business semantics and canonicals with MIGs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Scale B2B partners using MAGs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Govern contracts via TPM instead of tribal knowledge&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key realization:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Standardization is not bureaucracy.

It was about mastering the full capacity of all componentes from the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Integration Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt; and understanding how to orchestrate its platforms to drive better definitions, smarter configurations, and clearer responsibilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In any point of this series I mean that you are going to be Senior in APIM,EM,AEM,IS also, it's depends 100% of you cross this way.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1652874237"&gt;General to Commander: The Mastery&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In this series we discussed the &lt;STRONG&gt;"General"&lt;/STRONG&gt; mindset—the ability to look at the &lt;STRONG&gt;integration battlefield&lt;/STRONG&gt; (the SAP BTP Integration Suite Landscape) and understand where each unit (APIM, Event Mesh, IA, CPI) belongs, but there is a rank beyond the General:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1198195294"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Commander&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;There will be no "General to Commander" guide. That path is 100% yours to walk and responsability, and it is defined by the complexity of the chaos you are willing to own.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_0-1768031442299.png" style="width: 752px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/360005i4D3A6BC5173B1CAF/image-dimensions/752x473/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="752" height="473" role="button" title="rhviana_0-1768031442299.png" alt="rhviana_0-1768031442299.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Image 2 - The way from SAP CPI Developer ( Any level ) to Commander prespective&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;I really hope you enjoy this series, the next blog I will go deep in the SAP Integration Advisor, I just don't know when I'm going to release it I want take break to write.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you recognized yourself somewhere between the Soldier and the General while reading this series or stuck in the SAP CPI Expert Label, that is not a weakness.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is awareness and awareness is where real growth begins.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Viana.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the SAP HANA Cloud 2025 Q3 release, several new embedded Machine Learning / AI functions&amp;nbsp;have been released with the SAP HANA Cloud Predictive Analysis Library (PAL) and the Automated Predictive Library (APL). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An enhancement summary is available in the What’s new document for &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/whats-new/2495b34492334456a49084831c2bea4e?Category=Predictive+Analysis+Library&amp;amp;Valid_as_Of=2025-09-01:2025-09-30&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP HANA Cloud database 2025.28 (QRC 3/2025)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1787736735"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1591223230"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Time series analysis and forecasting function enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Threshold support in timeseries outlier detection &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In time series, an outlier is a data point that is different from the general behavior of remaining data points.&amp;nbsp; In the PAL &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;time series outlier detection&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; function, the outlier detection task is divided into two steps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In step 1 the residual values are derived from the original series, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In step 2, the outliers are detected from the residual values.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Multiple methods are available to evaluate a data point to be an outlier or not. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Including Z1 score, Z2 score, IIQR score, MAD score, IsolationForest, DBSCAN&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If used in combination, outlier voting can be applied for a combined evaluation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now, &lt;STRONG&gt;new&lt;/STRONG&gt; and in addition, &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;thresholds values for outlier scores&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; are supported&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;New parameter OUTPUT_OUTLIER_THRESHOLD &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Based on the given threshold value, if the time series value is beyond the (upper and lower) outlier threshold for the time series, the corresponding data point as an outlier.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Only valid when outlier_method = 'iqr', 'isolationforest', 'mad', 'z1', 'z2'.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ChristophMorgen_0-1767958753257.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359750iE20F7716FF87FA07/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ChristophMorgen_0-1767958753257.jpeg" alt="ChristophMorgen_0-1767958753257.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1394709725"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Classification and regression function enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Corset sampling support with SVM models&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Coreset sampling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a machine learning technique to&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;select a small, representative subset (the "coreset") from larger datasets,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;enabling faster, more efficient training and processing while maintaining similar model accuracy as using the full data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It works by identifying the most "informative" samples, filtering out redundant or noisy data, and allowing complex algorithms to run on a manageable dataset sizes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Support Vector Machine (SVM)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;model training is computationally expensive, and computational costs are specifically sensitive to the number of training points, which makes SVM models often impractical for large datasets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Therefore SVM in the Predictive Analysis Library has been enhanced and now&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;offers&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;embedded coreset sampling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;capabilities&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;enabled with the new parameters USE_CORESET and CORESET_SCALE as the &lt;SPAN&gt;sampling ratio when constructing coreset&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This enhancement significantly reduces SVM training time with minimal impact on accuracy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ChristophMorgen_1-1767958753264.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359751iDA955B4D29D2C3A9/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ChristophMorgen_1-1767958753264.png" alt="ChristophMorgen_1-1767958753264.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1198196220"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AutoML and pipeline function enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Target encoding support in&amp;nbsp;AutoML&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The PAL AutoML framework introduces a new pipeline operator for target encoding of categorial features&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Categorical data is often required to be preprocessed and required to get converted from non-numerical features into formats suitable for the respective machine learning algorithm, i.e. numeric values&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Examples features: text labels (e.g., “red,” “blue”) or discrete categories (e.g., “high,” “medium,” “low”)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;One-hot encoding converts each categorial feature value &amp;nbsp;into a binary column (0 or 1), which works well for features with a limited number of unique values. PAL already applies an optimized one-hot encoding method aggregating very low frequent values.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Target encoding replaces the categorial values with the mean of the target / label column for high-cardinality features, which avoids to create large and sparse one-hot encoded feature matrices&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Example of a high cardinality feature: “city” column with hundreds-thousands of unique values, postal code, product IDs etc.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The PAL AutoML engine will analyze the input feature cardinality and then automatically decide if to apply target encoding or another encoding method. For medium to high cardinality categorial features, target encoding may improve the performance significantly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By automating target encoding, the PAL AutoML engine aims to improve model performance and generalization, especially when dealing with complex, high-cardinality categorical features, without requiring manual intervention.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition, the AutoML and pipeline function now also support columns of type half precision vector.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1001682715"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-805169210"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Misc. Machine Learning and statistics function enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;High-dimensional feature data reduction using UMAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm used to simplify complex, high-dimensional feature spaces, while preserving its essential structure. It is widely considered the modern gold standard for visualizing targeted dimension reduction of large-scale datasets, because it balances computational speed with the ability to maintain both local and global relationships.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It reduces thousands of variables (dimensions) into 2D or 3D scatter plots that humans can easily interpret.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Unlike comparable methods like t-SNE, UMAP is better at preserving global structure, meaning the relative positions between different clusters remain more meaningful.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than t-SNE, capable of processing datasets with millions of points in a reasonable timeframe.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It can be used as a "transformer" preprocessing step in Machine Learning scenarios to reduce large feature spaces before applying clustering (e.g., k-means, HDBSCAN) or classification models, often improving their performance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The following new functions are introduced&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;_SYS_AFL.PAL_UMAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;​ with the most important &lt;SPAN&gt;parameters N_NEIGHBORS, MIN_DIST, N_COMPONENTS, DISTANCE_LEVEL&lt;/SPAN&gt;​&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;_SYS_AFL.PAL_TRUSTWORTHINESS&lt;/SPAN&gt;​, u&lt;SPAN&gt;sed to measure the structure similarity between original high dimensional space and embedded low dimensional space based on K nearest neighbors.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Calculating pairwise distances&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Many algorithms, for example clustering algorithms utilize distance matrixes as a preprocessing step, often inbuild to the functions. While often there is the wish to decouple though the distance matrix calculation from the follow-up task like the actual clustering. Moreover, if decoupled custom calculated matrixes can be fed into algorithms as input.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Most PAL clustering functions support to feed-in a pre-calculated similarity matrix&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now, a dedicated &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-predictive-analysis-library/distance-md?version=LATEST&amp;amp;q=distance&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pairwise distance calculation&lt;/A&gt; function is provided &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It supports distance metrics like &lt;EM&gt;Manhattan, Euclidien, Minkowski, Chebyshey&lt;/EM&gt; as well as &lt;STRONG&gt;Levenshtein&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Levenshtein distance&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; (or “edit distance”) is a distance metric specifically targeting distance between text-columns. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one word into another, acting as a measure of their similarity. A lower distance indicates a higher similarity.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Applicable use cases&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is useful in data cleaning, table column similarity analysis between columns of the same data type.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After calculating the column similarity across all data types, clustering like K-Means can be applied to group similar fields and propose mappings for fields within the same cluster&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Real Vector data type support&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following PAL functions have been enhanced to support columns of type real vector&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Spectral Clustering&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cluster Assignment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Decision tree&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sampling&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In addition the AutoML and pipeline function now also support columns of type half precision vector.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-608655705"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Creating Vector Embeddings enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP HANA Database Vector Engine function VECTOR_EMBEDDING()&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;has added support for remote, SAP AI Core exposed embedding models.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello SAP Community,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My name is Pierre, and I'm 62 yo.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I worked as a Senior Director, Product Communications at SAP, first for &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP%2520Intelligent%2520Robotic%2520Process%2520Automation/pd-p/73554900100800002142" target="_self"&gt;SAP Intelligent RPA&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;as Head of Communications then for &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP%2520Build/pd-p/73555000100700001491" target="_self"&gt;SAP Build&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;as the oldest member, by far &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;, of the Product Communications and Enablement Team, with wonderful colleagues that I miss. 🩵&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since April 2025, I'm not actively working for SAP anymore, as I was lucky enough to be &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/so-this-is-it-i-m-verped/ba-p/14068989" target="_self"&gt;eligible for the Voluntary Early Retiring Plan&lt;/A&gt; launched by SAP in 2024. On one side I really miss the wonderful colleagues I was working with, but on the other side I'm very happy to have more time for my hobbies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;I’d like to share a bit about my hobbies as a part of the &amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/community-corner-blog-posts/bg-p/Coffee-Cornerblog-board/label-name/hobbies" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Community Hobbies series&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1658620262"&gt;First hobby: building Legos&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I have always loved building things with Lego: my brother Jean-François and I got our first Lego set when I was 5, and throughout our childhood we played Lego a lot, with our father guiding us. We built houses, castles, and also vehicles with the electric motor etc.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Then in 1978, at age 15, I discovered the first microcomputers, and I turned away a bit from Lego to code my first computer programs.&lt;BR /&gt;You will find more about my beginnings as a progammer in the blog post &lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/blog-it-forward-pierre-col/ba-p/13449598" target="_blank"&gt;Blog it Forward – Pierre Col&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;I published exactly 6 years ago.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It's also because I love building from scratch that I was very happy to work for &lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP%2520Build/pd-p/73555000100700001491" target="_self"&gt;SAP Build&lt;/A&gt;: this low-code + pro-code solution allows business users and developers to very easily build applications, automated processes, and websites.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For Christmas 2024, my youngest daughter offered me the &lt;A href="https://www.lego.com/fr-fr/product/porsche-911-10295" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Lego Porsche 911 set&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;: 1458 parts, to build either a Turbo or a Targa. I have completed the building in a few months:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="legos.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359847i48F79D0643C5F11F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="legos.jpg" alt="legos.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I like this activity very much, because building Legos really helps me relaxing.&lt;BR /&gt;To be continued!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1462106757"&gt;Second hobby: riding my vintage bikes&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;You will understand that I'm a petrolhead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, I have always been into motorbikes, because my father was a biker.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1394675971"&gt;From Norton...&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 1973, when I was 10 yo, he sold the Norton 88 I've ever seen in the garage to buy a magnificent&amp;nbsp; '1970 Norton Commando.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And every morning he was driving me to the high school, on the way to his work. You can easily imagine how proud I was...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My father always kept this bike in his garage, riding it until he was 75 yo. When I was visiting my parents, I regularly did some small tours on the Norton to keep it up and running.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="IMG_20230112_103713_081.jpg" style="width: 701px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359095iC9F548A231A2D9FE/image-dimensions/701x709/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="701" height="709" role="button" title="IMG_20230112_103713_081.jpg" alt="IMG_20230112_103713_081.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When my father passed, almost 4 years ago, in accordance with my brother I inherited his bike. I did not ride it since then, and I will spend some time this Spring to restart it and ride it again in the countryside around Lyon...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="IMG_20230318_150528_031.jpg" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359096iCC9C19E645E76697/image-dimensions/640x386/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="640" height="386" role="button" title="IMG_20230318_150528_031.jpg" alt="IMG_20230318_150528_031.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can hear the wonderful sound of the Norton Twin roaring&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://soundcloud.com/pierrecol/norton-750-commando" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1198162466"&gt;&lt;A href="https://soundcloud.com/pierrecol/norton-750-commando" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Norton 750 Commando - acceleration by Pierre Col on SoundCloud.png" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359122iEB9BAB972F8FAAED/image-dimensions/640x360/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="640" height="360" role="button" title="Norton 750 Commando - acceleration by Pierre Col on SoundCloud.png" alt="Norton 750 Commando - acceleration by Pierre Col on SoundCloud.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1001648961"&gt;... to Honda...&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 1981, my first motorbike was a Honda 750 Four. With 67 hp for 220 kg, it was for me an incredibly powerful bike. In 1987 I bought a Honda CB 900 Bol d'Or which I still own:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="900 Bol d'Or 3 images 1600 px.png" style="width: 799px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359136iB575CF49F865C24B/image-dimensions/799x544/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="799" height="544" role="button" title="900 Bol d'Or 3 images 1600 px.png" alt="900 Bol d'Or 3 images 1600 px.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I lent it in 1997 to an uncle living in Grenoble, he stills ride it but as he is 75yo now I imagine that he won't ride it for very long and I should get the 900 Bol d'Or back in my garage in a couple of years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-805135456"&gt;... and finally to Ducati&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since 1997, I ride Ducati motorbikes. It started with a 916, then I had a 350 Mark3 Desmo, a 900 Supersport, a 998 S, a Desmosedici RR and a Panigale 1299 R Final Edition. Yes, I really like fast red bike made in Bologna!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Panigale Final Edition, with 209 hp for 168 kg, was the most powerful and amazing bike I'ev ever ridden.&amp;nbsp;Indeed, even if it was a MotoGP replica with a V4 engine revving up to 14,200 rpm, the Desmosedici RR was not as efficient as the Panigale...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And I really enjoyed the very light and agile '1973 350 Mark3 Desmo I had during a few years, riding it on teh road as on tracks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="20251208_181337.jpg" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359100i10F3CF15F3C14C5A/image-dimensions/640x640/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="640" height="640" role="button" title="20251208_181337.jpg" alt="20251208_181337.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, fancy bikes attract thieves: bought in 1997, my 916 was stolen in 1999. My 998 S bought in 2002 and my rare Desmosedici RR #282 bought in 2007 were stolen in 2011. And my Panigale 1299 R Final Edition #322 bought in 2017 was stolen in 2023.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="IMG_20230525_140259.jpg" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359099i788228AEED0C52B6/image-dimensions/640x640/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="640" height="640" role="button" title="IMG_20230525_140259.jpg" alt="IMG_20230525_140259.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After some bastards stole my Panigale, I refurbished my good old '1994 900 Supersport which I bought in 2000, and lent to a friend from 2004 to 2019. I'm really enjoying riding this light (180 kg) and powerful enough (80 hp) bike on the curvy road in the hills, one hour northwest from Lyon:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="900 Supersport with me.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359848i71EC1A664B8A0AFF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="900 Supersport with me.jpg" alt="900 Supersport with me.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-479539232"&gt;Third hobby: driving my vintage 911 Porsche cabriolet&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In 2011, right after insurance reimbursed my stolen Desmosedici RR, a good friend of mine decided to sell his 1990 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 cabriolet. It was the same car that hank Moody was driving in "Californication", but in better shape, with 135,000 km on the odometer. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:"&gt;😉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Porsche 911.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359849iF5BD7F8E71805A56/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Porsche 911.jpg" alt="Porsche 911.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We quickly had a deal, and since more than 14 years I enjoy riding this vintage car, in any weather condition. I just passed 180,000 km and it works perfectly fine. According to my mechanic, my Porsche could reach 250,000 km without any trouble, and as I drive less than 5,000 km per year, for sure it will survive me:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="20210103_145951.jpg" style="width: 711px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359109iCF13EEA6BA164039/image-dimensions/711x400/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="711" height="400" role="button" title="20210103_145951.jpg" alt="20210103_145951.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As my wife will be very busy in May 2026, I decided that I will do&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;a "5,000 km in 3-4 weeks" road trip across Central Europe in my Porsche 911: I will pay a visit to my former colleagues in Walldorf, Berlin and maybe a few other cities in Germany before heading to Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland...&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-541191165"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="map + photos.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359850i4CD094A6067CE903/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="map + photos.jpg" alt="map + photos.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-344677660"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Feel free to say hello if you would like me to pay you a visit, between May 1st and May 23:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;I will be more than happy to let you drive my Porsche in your neighborhood! &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="keep calm 180K km.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/359860i0A82AF9F8A6DEA5F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="keep calm 180K km.jpg" alt="keep calm 180K km.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a new and innovative feature of API Management, part of the SAP Integration Suite. Expanding on traditional API Management, Graph allows you to present all your business data as a semantically connected data graph, accessible through a single, unified, and powerful API.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Graph in SAP Integration Suite is now available for a limited time as a closed beta program and includes the following new features:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A configuration UI for creating business data graphs – an extension of the new Integration Suite configuration UI.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The ability to extend the built-in Graph data model.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Graph Navigator (Enterprise Edition) – a tool for exploring and testing queries on your configured business data graphs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;GraphQL support (in addition to OData v4).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Graph Capability in Integration Suite: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="azharsd_0-1767780018922.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358850iFB77C48768FA66FE/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="azharsd_0-1767780018922.png" alt="azharsd_0-1767780018922.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Graph can be used in any SAP Integration Suite plan where API Management is available (including SAP BTP trial accounts), but not necessarily in every region where API Management is available. For more details about the regional availability of Graph, be sure to check out &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;SAP Note 3338820&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enabling Graph on your Integration Suite&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensuring the Required Roles and Enabling Graph&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Make sure you have the &lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Suite Provisioner&lt;/STRONG&gt; role.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigate to &lt;STRONG&gt;"Manage Capabilities" → "Add Capabilities"&lt;/STRONG&gt; in your Integration Suite home.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enable &lt;STRONG&gt;API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; (if not already enabled) through the &lt;STRONG&gt;"Manage APIs"&lt;/STRONG&gt; section.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enable &lt;STRONG&gt;API Business Hub Enterprise&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt; (API Business Hub Enterprise is mandatory for Graph).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If &lt;STRONG&gt;Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt; is not visible, refer to &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;SAP Note 3338820&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as it may not be supported in your region.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Select &lt;STRONG&gt;"Enable API Business Hub Enterprise"&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;"Graph"&lt;/STRONG&gt; to complete the setup.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Graph requires &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; to be activated.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="azharsd_1-1767780018932.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/358852i48170E6B180E0B97/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="azharsd_1-1767780018932.png" alt="azharsd_1-1767780018932.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Assigning Roles for Graph&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once &lt;STRONG&gt;Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt;

This could be a S/4Hana On-Premises System or a S/4Hana Public Cloud Edition System. These are classic ODATA APIs from SAP –&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Business Partner ODATA API&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Sales Order ODATA API&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note: In my case I’m using SAP Business Accelerator Hub – API HUB &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Querying Sales Orders and Customer Details with SAP Graph&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In a &lt;STRONG&gt;typical integration scenario&lt;/STRONG&gt;, querying &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Orders&lt;/STRONG&gt; from &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt; and fetching &lt;STRONG&gt;Customer Details (SoldToParty)&lt;/STRONG&gt; involves:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Making an OData GET request&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order API&lt;/STRONG&gt; to retrieve Sales Order details.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Making another OData GET request&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Business Partner API&lt;/STRONG&gt; to fetch the corresponding &lt;STRONG&gt;SoldToParty&lt;/STRONG&gt; details.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enriching the data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; using &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; to combine the two datasets.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Since SAP provides this information through &lt;STRONG&gt;two separate APIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;, this approach traditionally requires &lt;STRONG&gt;two API calls&lt;/STRONG&gt; and additional processing to merge the data. However, with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Graph (BDGs - Business Data Graphs)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you can simplify this by using a &lt;STRONG&gt;single GraphQL query&lt;/STRONG&gt; to fetch Sales Orders and their associated Customer details in one call.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Simplifying Data Retrieval with SAP Graph&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Traditionally, in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;, fetching &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order&lt;/STRONG&gt; details along with &lt;STRONG&gt;SoldToParty (Customer Details)&lt;/STRONG&gt; from &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt; requires:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Multiple OData API calls&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; (one for Sales Orders, one for Business Partners).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Content Enrichers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to merge and process the data.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Lookups&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to fetch related information across different API endpoints.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is a &lt;STRONG&gt;common challenge&lt;/STRONG&gt; when integrating SAP and non-SAP &lt;STRONG&gt;SaaS applications&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Power of SAP Graph (BDGs - Business Data Graphs)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Graph on Integration Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you can retrieve all this data in &lt;STRONG&gt;one API call&lt;/STRONG&gt;—with &lt;STRONG&gt;no custom development&lt;/STRONG&gt;!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Graph introduces the concept of &lt;STRONG&gt;Mirrored Entities&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which allows you to:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Access data from &lt;STRONG&gt;multiple APIs as a single, unified data model&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Query related entities (e.g., Sales Orders and SoldToParty) &lt;STRONG&gt;in a single request&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reduce integration complexity and &lt;STRONG&gt;eliminate the need for multiple lookups/enrichers&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What’s Next?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We’ll explore &lt;STRONG&gt;Mirrored Entities&lt;/STRONG&gt; in SAP Graph and see how they can &lt;STRONG&gt;simplify&lt;/STRONG&gt; fetching &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order details&lt;/STRONG&gt; along with &lt;STRONG&gt;Customer details&lt;/STRONG&gt; from an &lt;STRONG&gt;Business Accelerator Hub—all in one call&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Creating Destinations on SAP BTP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To integrate SAP Graph with your &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;On-Premise&lt;/STRONG&gt; system, you need to create destinations on your &lt;STRONG&gt;BTP Subaccount&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You have your &lt;STRONG&gt;OData API endpoint&lt;/STRONG&gt; for &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Orders&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Business Partners&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A &lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Communication User&lt;/STRONG&gt; is set up with the required roles and permissions to access these APIs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Steps to Create Destinations in BTP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigate to BTP Cockpit&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Go to your &lt;STRONG&gt;BTP Subaccount&lt;/STRONG&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(Jana Subramanian serves as the Head of Cybersecurity and Compliance in SEA and is recognized as a Fellow of Information Privacy (FIP) by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). He supports strategic customer engagements on cybersecurity, data privacy, multi-cloud security architecture, contractual assurance, and compliance.)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enterprise AI has moved decisively from experimentation to strategic necessity. Organizations today are no longer debating whether to adopt AI, but how to deploy it securely, responsibly, and at scale without breaking existing business processes, security models, or compliance obligations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business AI represents SAP’s enterprise-first approach to this challenge. Rather than treating AI as a standalone capability, SAP embeds intelligence directly into business applications and executes AI-driven actions within the same architectural boundaries that govern core enterprise workloads. This means AI operates with full awareness of business context, user identity, authorization, data sensitivity, and regulatory constraints.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog provides an end-to-end architectural walkthrough of SAP Business AI using a layered reference architecture. It explains how Joule serves as the unified AI interaction layer, how agentic execution patterns enable AI to plan and act within controlled boundaries, how identity and principal propagation enforce enterprise authorization, and how security, privacy, and governance are built into every stage of the AI lifecycle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-Layered Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Business AI architecture is designed as a layered system, where each layer has a distinct responsibility while remaining tightly integrated with adjacent layers. This separation of concerns allows enterprises to adopt AI capabilities incrementally, without compromising identity, security, or governance controls.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AI Framework - Trust Boundaries Blog.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/360107i901BF7CC091D1BA3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="AI Framework - Trust Boundaries Blog.png" alt="AI Framework - Trust Boundaries Blog.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Layer 1: Experience Layer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The experience layer represents the entry point for business users and developers interacting with AI capabilities. It includes familiar SAP user touchpoints such as SAP Fiori, SAP Build Work Zone, Joule Co-Pilot, and SAP Mobile Start. This layer is responsible for presenting AI capabilities in a way that feels native to SAP applications rather than as a separate AI tool.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule sits prominently in this layer as the conversational interface, translating user intent into structured requests that can be processed by the AI runtime. SAP Build also appears in this layer, reflecting how custom applications and extensions can expose AI-driven experiences using the same architectural foundation. Importantly, this layer does not execute AI logic itself. It captures intent and context and hands off responsibility to the orchestration layer below.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="909px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="274.297px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Component&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="633.703px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="274.297px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Fiori&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="633.703px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enterprise web applications that surface AI-assisted insights and actions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="274.297px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Build Work Zone&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="633.703px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unified digital workplace that exposes AI-driven tasks and recommendations&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="274.297px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule Co-Pilot&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="633.703px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Conversational AI interface that captures user intent across SAP applications&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="274.297px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Mobile Start&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="633.703px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mobile-first access to AI-assisted workflows and insights&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="274.297px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Build&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="633.703px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Low-code and no-code tools to design AI-enabled user experiences&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Layer 2: Orchestration Layer - Coordinating AI Execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The orchestration layer is where SAP Business AI moves beyond simple prompt-and-response interactions. This layer coordinates how AI requests are prepared, governed, and executed. It includes AI Core as the execution backbone, SAP Generative AI Hub (via SAP AI Core and SAP AI Launchpad) as the controlled access point to foundation models, and supporting capabilities such as prompt templating, data masking, content filtering, and agent memory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This layer is responsible for shaping requests before they ever reach a model. Prompts are templated to enforce consistency, sensitive data is masked where required, and content filters are applied to ensure responsible usage. Agent memory allows the system to maintain conversational and task context across multiple steps, enabling more advanced, agentic execution patterns. By centralizing orchestration here, SAP ensures that AI behavior is predictable, repeatable, and policy aware.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Component&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI Core&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Runtime for executing AI workloads and agentic execution loops under policy control&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Generative AI Hub&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Centralized, harmonized access to foundation models with enterprise governance&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prompt Templating&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standardizes prompt structure to ensure consistency, control, and predictable model behavior&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data Masking&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Detects and masks sensitive data before it is sent to models&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Content Filter (Input)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Evaluates and filters user input to enforce responsible AI usage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Content Filter (Output)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Screens model responses to prevent unsafe or non-compliant output&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agent Memory&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Session Context Management (Agent Memory Pattern) – Maintains conversational and task context across multi-step interactions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Harmonized API Access&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Provides a consistent interface for invoking models and AI capabilities across providers&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Layer 3: Grounding Layer - Anchoring AI in Enterprise Context&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The grounding layer ensures that AI responses are based on enterprise reality rather than generic model knowledge. This layer is responsible for context and evidence retrieval and connects AI execution to authoritative business data and documents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As shown in the architecture, grounding sources include SAP Business Data Cloud, SAP Datasphere, document repositories, knowledge graphs, and the SAP HANA Vector Engine. SAP Integration Suite also plays a role in accessing distributed enterprise systems. Together, these components allow AI to retrieve relevant business context using semantic and vector-based techniques, ensuring that responses are accurate, explainable, and aligned with enterprise data models.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This layer is fundamental to trust. By grounding AI outputs in traceable enterprise sources, SAP Business AI enables explainability and reduces the risk of hallucinations or contextually incorrect actions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="852px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="268.719px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Grounding Source&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="582.281px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use Case&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="268.719px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Context and Evidence Retrieval&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="582.281px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Real-time retrieval of relevant business context and supporting evidence&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="268.719px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Knowledge Graph&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="582.281px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Semantic relationships between business entities and concepts&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="268.719px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business Data Cloud&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="582.281px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unified business data foundation across SAP applications&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="268.719px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Datasphere&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="582.281px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Analytical and data warehousing context for AI grounding&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="268.719px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Document Grounding&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="582.281px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Retrieval of unstructured business documents such as contracts and PDFs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="268.719px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="582.281px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Vector-based semantic search and similarity matching&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="268.719px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Suite&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="582.281px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Real-time access to distributed and third-party systems&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Layer 4: &amp;nbsp;Execution Layer - Turning Insight into Action&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The execution layer is where AI-driven decisions are translated into concrete business actions. This includes SAP APIs, Joule Skills, function calling, Model Context Protocol servers, agent-to-agent interactions, and SAP Build Process Automation workflows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This layer enables AI to move from recommendation to execution, whether that means calling an SAP API, triggering a workflow, or coordinating actions across systems. Importantly, execution is not autonomous in an uncontrolled sense. Tool access and actions are constrained by identity, authorization, and runtime policies inherited from the underlying platform. This ensures that AI can act, but only within the same boundaries that apply to human users and technical integrations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="269px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Execution Mechanism&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="661px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="269px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP APIs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="661px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Invoke business operations in SAP applications such as S/4HANA, SuccessFactors, and other SAP services&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="269px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule Skills&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="661px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Encapsulate reusable business actions that can be triggered through Joule&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="269px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Function Calling&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="661px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enable structured invocation of predefined actions based on AI decisions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="269px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="661px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Open standard providing standardized context and tool interfaces for AI-driven execution (governed via AI Agent Hub in SAP LeanIX)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="269px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Interaction&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="661px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Industry protocol enabling coordinated actions across multiple specialized agents&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="269px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Build Process Automation (BPA)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="661px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Trigger workflows and business processes requiring orchestration or approvals&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Layer 5: Governance Layer - Sustaining Trust Across the AI Lifecycle&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The governance layer spans the entire architecture and ensures that SAP Business AI remains compliant, auditable, and manageable over time. It includes capabilities such as AI Agent Hub in SAP LeanIX, Joule Studio, AI Launchpad, model registries, data privacy integration, and audit log services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This layer governs both design-time and runtime aspects of AI. Before deployment, use cases, risks, and models are reviewed and approved. During runtime, actions are logged, monitored, and subject to human-in-the-loop controls where required. After deployment, lifecycle management, regulatory alignment, auditability, and traceability ensure that AI systems continue to meet enterprise and regulatory expectations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="884px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="277.734px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governance Component&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="605.266px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="277.734px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI Agent Hub in SAP LeanIX&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="605.266px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Central visibility and governance of AI agents and their relationships&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="277.734px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="605.266px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Design-time configuration and management of Joule skills and AI interactions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="277.734px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI Launchpad&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="605.266px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Model lifecycle management, versioning, and approval workflows&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="277.734px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Model Registry&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="605.266px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Central inventory of approved AI models and configurations&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="277.734px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data Privacy Integration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="605.266px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enforcement of data protection and privacy controls across AI usage&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="277.734px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Audit Log Service&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="605.266px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Centralized logging of AI actions for auditability and compliance&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="277.734px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Human-in-the-Loop Controls&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="605.266px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Approval gates for sensitive or high-risk AI-driven actions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cross-Cutting Controls: Security, Privacy, and Observability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Running alongside all layers are cross-cutting enterprise controls covering identity and access, data protection, content safety, and observability. Authentication, principal propagation, OAuth-based access, encryption, tenant isolation, audit logging, and monitoring are not tied to a single layer but are enforced consistently across the entire stack.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This design reinforces a core principle of SAP Business AI: SAP Business AI is designed to extend existing enterprise security controls rather than introduce parallel security models. Identity, authorization, and audit principles that govern SAP applications are applied consistently to AI-driven interactions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AI Security Control.png" style="width: 813px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/360109i0BCB6C549975A677/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="AI Security Control.png" alt="AI Security Control.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agentic AI Execution Flow: From User Intent to Governed Business Action&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This diagram illustrates broadly how SAP Business AI executes agentic workflows in a controlled, enterprise-grade manner. The flow begins with the user interacting through Joule in the experience layer. Joule captures intent and context but does not execute logic itself. Instead, it forwards the request to the agent orchestration layer running on SAP BTP, where the execution lifecycle is coordinated under policy control.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the core of this flow is SAP AI Core, which manages the agent runtime and enforces execution boundaries. Large language model calls are routed through SAP GenAI Hub, while short-term memory maintains session context and intermediate reasoning. Grounding retrieves enterprise-relevant context and evidence from long-term memory sources such as SAP Datasphere, SAP S/4HANA data, documents, and the SAP HANA Vector Engine. Based on this grounded context, the agent proposes the next action. Crucially, all actions pass through control execution code that enforces authorization, audit logging, and human confirmation where required. Only then are SAP APIs, workflows, or automations invoked. Results are returned through the orchestration layer back to Joule, accompanied by explanations and supporting evidence.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This execution model ensures that SAP Business AI can reason and act, but never outside established enterprise controls. AI-driven actions follow the same identity, authorization, and audit principles as human-initiated actions, making the system predictable, explainable, and trustworthy at scale.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Agentic AI Flow v1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/360110iD09B30F6CC2AEDAA/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Agentic AI Flow v1.png" alt="Agentic AI Flow v1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="872px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Flow Element&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Responsibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;User&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Initiates the request or question through an SAP application&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule (Experience Layer)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Captures user intent and presents AI-driven responses&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agent Orchestration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Coordinates the agent workflow and execution sequence&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI Core&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Executes the agent runtime with policy enforcement&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;LLM Call (via GenAI Hub)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Performs language reasoning using governed model access&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Short-Term Memory&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Maintains session context and intermediate results&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Grounding&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Retrieves enterprise context and Top-K evidence for accuracy&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Long-Term Memory&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Provides access to business data, documents, and vectors&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agent Proposes Tool Call&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Determines the next business action to execute&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Control Execution Code&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enforces authorization, audit logging, and approvals&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tool Invocation &amp;amp; Action&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Executes SAP APIs, workflows, or automations&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="253.766px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Results Returned to Joule&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="617.234px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Delivers explained outcomes with supporting evidence&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Key Considerations for Adoption&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While SAP Business AI provides a comprehensive architectural foundation, successful adoption requires deliberate planning:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Start with Identity, Not AI:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Before enabling Joule or deploying agents, ensure your SAP BTP identity and access management foundation is solid. Principal propagation, role-based authorization, and audit logging must already be in place AI capabilities inherit these controls rather than introducing new ones.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Grounding Quality Determines AI Quality:&lt;/STRONG&gt; AI outputs are only as trustworthy as the data they are grounded in. Prioritize data quality, semantic consistency, and governance in SAP Business Data Cloud and SAP Datasphere before scaling AI use cases across the enterprise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Govern Agents Early, Not Later:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The proliferation of AI agents SAP-delivered, custom-built, and third-party can quickly become unmanageable. Establish visibility and governance through the AI Agent Hub in SAP LeanIX from day one. Retrofitting governance after deployment is significantly harder.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plan for Human-in-the-Loop by Design:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Not every AI-driven action should be autonomous. Identify high-risk processes, such as financial approvals or compliance-sensitive workflows, and design explicit human checkpoints using SAP Build Process Automation before deploying agentic capabilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Real World Complexity&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The layered architecture presented in this blog is a conceptual framework synthesized from SAP product capabilities and architectural patterns. It is intended to help readers understand how the components fit together, not to represent an official SAP reference architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In practice, enterprise landscapes are rarely this clean. Organizations typically face:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hybrid environments&lt;/STRONG&gt; where on-premises SAP S/4HANA, RISE with SAP Cloud ERP Private, and GROW with SAP S/4HANA cloud, public edition, SaaS cloud deployments, requiring careful consideration of where AI processing occurs and how data flows across trust boundaries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; scenarios where organizations deploy custom or third-party models in SAP AI Core, introducing additional customer responsibility for model security, bias testing, and lifecycle management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-cloud and non-SAP integrations&lt;/STRONG&gt; where AI agents must access data from AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or third-party SaaS applications each introducing distinct authentication models, data residency constraints, and compliance requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Regulatory variability&lt;/STRONG&gt; where AI governance requirements differ significantly across jurisdictions (for example, the EU AI Act and sector-specific regulations), requiring flexible policy enforcement rather than one-size-fits-all controls. This framework provides a starting point, but each enterprise must map it to its specific landscape, risk tolerance, and regulatory context. For a deeper look at trust boundaries and secure data flows, see &lt;EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/securing-sap-business-ai-architectures-trust-boundaries-and-secure-data/ba-p/14295118" target="_blank"&gt;Securing SAP Business AI Architectures.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business AI shows that enterprise-scale AI does not require compromising on security, privacy, or governance. By structuring AI as a layered architecture across experience, orchestration, grounding, execution, and governance, SAP embeds intelligence directly into business processes while ensuring that every AI interaction operates within established identity, authorization, and audit controls. Joule captures user intent, orchestration governs how AI requests are shaped and executed, grounding anchors decisions in enterprise data, and execution translates insight into action only within approved boundaries, while governance ensures lifecycle oversight and regulatory alignment. The result is an AI operating model that allows systems to reason and act with confidence, transparency, and control, moving AI from experimentation into a trusted, operational capability for the enterprise&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;References:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/securing-sap-business-ai-architectures-trust-boundaries-and-secure-data/ba-p/14295118" target="_blank"&gt;Securing SAP Business AI Architecture: Trust Boundaries and Secure Data Flows&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI Core&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/generative-ai-hub-in-sap-ai-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Generative AI Hub in AI Core&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-teched-berlin-2025-real-time-data-for-ai-agents-grounding-with-event/ba-p/14252572" target="_blank"&gt;Grounding with AI Driven Architecture&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/generative-ai/orchestration-workflow-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Orchestration Workflow&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/Joule_Studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;© 2026 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.
