    <content>&lt;P&gt;Most organisations realise that Agentic AI will become critical to their business. But there is still hesitation about giving up more control to these new agents. What if they make bad decisions, what if they do the wrong thing ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’ve been in the technology industry for more decades than I may care to admit. Before joining SAP, I spent 14 years working within Financial Services and Capital Markets. It is interesting to reflect on those times. Many of the challenges back then remain the same today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Financial Services, the major players did not hesitate to innovate with new technology – for them it was opportunity. Very early on they realised that trading in “simpler” financial instruments ( e.g. foreign exchange ) did not really need humans shouting excitedly at one another on the (tele)phone. That trading was quickly handed over to computers – and whilst it was perhaps not AI by today’s definition, it was certainly &lt;STRONG&gt;algorithmic&lt;/STRONG&gt; and it was most definitely &lt;STRONG&gt;autonomous&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Billions still gets traded by these Agentic AI predecessors, all based on the lightning-fast decisions they make ( but operating within parameters and thresholds defined by humans that quantify the risk ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Decisions are made as a result of an event that arises. &lt;U&gt;Better&lt;/U&gt; decisions are made knowing the wider context of that event. Yes, context comes from data. Wider context ( surprise ! ) comes from more and different data. But all that data needs to be super up-to-date, and accurate.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Financial Services firms understood and solved this also. In a 24x7 global market, there is no window for a batch run to load data. Trading systems, market data providers, stock exchanges, market and credit risk systems and more, all needed to be wired together for simultaneous update of data. Plus, it needed to be robust and flexible to add-in other market participants and their systems also.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most firms adopted architectures built around messaging-oriented middleware, with technologies like Enterprise Service Bus, Message Queue, and Event Bus amongst others, all being variations on a theme that today we call an &lt;STRONG&gt;Event Driven Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt; (EDA). Their appetite for speed pushed the technology to milli-second response times and super high-availability. Equally valuable was that the decoupled publisher-subscriber model allowed much faster and easier recovery if any of the participants in their expanded trading ecosystem did experience a failure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Perhaps such requirements seem a bit extreme for many companies operating in other industry segments. But the world is increasingly real time for the majority of businesses, and as Agentic AI plays a bigger part in your daily operations, it may be time to reflect on these lessons.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To highlight this more tangibly, I thought about a festive ( but fictional ? ) example where the capabilities of an Event Driven Architecture could really make a difference. So grab a coffee, something sweet to eat ( save the gym for the New Year ) and read on …&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Santa Inc refactors gift delivery on an Event Driven Architecture&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After decades relying on delivery to every home in sequence, Santa has realised this will no longer scale and he risks missing targets and some serious reputational damage. His operations used to be ok, but the customer base expands every year and getting to all of those in one day is now stretching the imagination.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="291356_GettyImages-1283733014_medium_jpg.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353517i5E415B5FBE57E34C/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="291356_GettyImages-1283733014_medium_jpg.jpg" alt="291356_GettyImages-1283733014_medium_jpg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Production used to be straightforward when it was just teddy bears, dolls, drums and toy trains, but now with games consoles, smartphones and other sophisticated presents it has become necessary to outsource to specialised manufacturing facilities in many countries. The elves have switched roles from sewing and carpentry to now managing supply chains, delivery bottlenecks and stock-outs – they’re stressed and threatening to go on strike ! Managing stock and purchasing was much easier when children used to write letters, but now they post their wish lists on social media – and keep changing their minds based on what is trending ! Logistics was never a problem – Rudolph and the other reindeer managed through even the harshest weather. But now they are obliged to adhere to air-traffic control diversions and compulsory rest stops. Finally, when delivering a present, it was disappointing to find out &amp;nbsp;( too late ) that the child had been naughty rather than nice. It meant carrying extra payload on the sleigh and unnecessary manufacturing and purchase costs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Santa has an extensive IT landscape and ecosystem. But he realised even his magical powers were no longer the answer – &lt;STRONG&gt;it was time to transform his operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;. But not rip and replace … even with 364 quieter days, that would still be too much work. Besides, most of the individual systems did what they needed to do – it was just they didn’t really react to each other that well. There was a lot of point-to-point connection between the production, inventory, CRM and other systems, with each repeatedly polling the other for updates – a real spaghetti architecture. Adding new suppliers’ systems into this landscape was slow. Recovering from any one system failure, having to replay lost transactions and regain overall confidence in stock quantities and delivery shipments an even bigger nightmare.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All of this was putting huge pressure on the elves. Santa has always been committed to his workforce, and he wanted the team to be happy and motivated. He looked to Agentic AI to help them, to manage the scale and complexity of supply chains. But like his elves, those AI agents would need to be super-smart, reactive, and always up to date with reliable data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And then the lightbulb went on for Santa. He was reading this &lt;A href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/10/06/1124323/enabling-real-time-responsiveness-with-event-driven-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;article&lt;/A&gt; about Event Driven Architecture and realised that would answer so many of these problems. The synchronous and repeated point-to-point communication is taken away. Instead, events are published asynchronously, with brokers distributing and guaranteeing them, to be consumed by any system that is interested – instantly ( super-fast ) and simultaneously ( not each system in turn ). The spaghetti is now replaced by something more like a giant distributed smorgasbord in which everyone ( elves, agents and ecosystem partners ) can share all at once. &lt;EM&gt;NOTE: Santa was never a fan of spaghetti but does quite enjoy a good smorgasbord.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With an Event Driven Architecture, Santa could be much more responsive in his production runs and purchasing. Plus, new suppliers could be on-boarded quickly and easily to cater for peaks in toy popularity, as well as getting up-to-date pricing and costs across his ecosystem. On the big night itself, so many of those delivery headaches could now be mitigated. Travel and weather alerts would be provided immediately for dynamic routing updates ( and for Santa, every milli-second matters ). Add to this a real-time feed of naughty-or-nice monitoring data being gathered by event brokers across the globe ( some in very remote locations ) and made available to the dynamic routing algorithm as well as stock logistics teams ( Santa has an increasing network of warehouses that he needs to stop at – he cannot carry everything on his sleigh ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Santa and his Enterprise Architect ( another Elf ) looked at options and decided on SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh. Given that 84% of the world’s global commerce runs on SAP systems, and these already have high-value business events out-of-the-box, it was likely that much of Santa’s ecosystem could be easily included. Even for those using other vendors’ applications, the solution was open to those via industry-standard protocols, plus it was possible to include custom-built events. It did not need rip and replace, and the system could scale by adding more brokers over time to create an&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;event mesh&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Even better, that same infrastructure could be used for other event use cases ( Santa wondered about moving into Travel &amp;amp; Entertainment for the rest of the year – perhaps offering trips on the sleigh into low earth orbit – he thought that might become popular ).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whilst looking at SAP, his Enterprise Architect saw SAP Build &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/joule-studio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/A&gt;, to create the AI agents. That seemed an obvious choice also – many processes would run on SAP, the most relevant and up-to-date operational data resides there, plus it offered a large choice of LLMs across the major providers. Quick to get into production also – because they rapidly needed to regain morale amongst the elves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So that’s the story of how one globally recognised brand came to explore the benefits of an Event Driven Architecture. If you recognise any similarities to challenges within your own business operation, then I would invite you learn more &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/integration-suite/advanced-event-mesh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;. Or, if you would like to see an example that the elves built earlier, then please do look at this &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2025/11/f0033bb9-297f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;short demo&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Reflecting on a busy year for &lt;A href="http://www.sap.com/btp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform&lt;/A&gt; (SAP BTP) in 2025, it’s clear to see that we’ve had good cause for celebration, having been awarded &lt;A href="https://www.g2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;G2&lt;/A&gt;’s much sought-after badges consistently across each quarter of the year. This has culminated only recently with their Winter 2026 awards, where again SAP BTP has received badges as a Leader in the &lt;A href="https://www.g2.com/categories/cloud-platform-as-a-service-paas" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Cloud Platform as a Service&lt;/A&gt; (PaaS) category.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But awarding badges to vendors is just one way in which G2 uses the data from customer feedback, while another is to help software buyers in their decision-making process through their quarterly Grid® reports for the various software categories that they cover. These reports, they say, represent the voice of real software users, based on data sourced from product reviews shared by G2 users and are intended to help technology buyers to assess and select the best products for their businesses, based on their peers’ experiences.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1896501958"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A place on the Grid®&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;As you can see in the recently issued &lt;A href="https://www.g2.com/reports/enterprise-grid-report-for-cloud-platform-as-a-service-paas-winter-2026.embed?featured=sap-business-technology-platform&amp;amp;secure%5Bgated_consumer%5D=69a766e3-9e6a-4f3a-9733-87b476502c0a&amp;amp;secure%5Btoken%5D=50205cb66aa7d70addbe2ae3d6124b4a6072d484a31a7d441c48c04756fa7940&amp;amp;utm_campaign=gate-2162913" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Enterprise Grid® Report for Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS)&lt;/A&gt;, SAP BTP has secured a strong position in the Leaders quadrant of this Grid report, which has only been made possible thanks to the incredible feedback from our customers, for which we can only offer our sincere thanks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A title="Enterprise Grid® Report for Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS)" href="https://www.g2.com/reports/enterprise-grid-report-for-cloud-platform-as-a-service-paas-winter-2026.embed?featured=sap-business-technology-platform&amp;amp;secure%5Bgated_consumer%5D=69a766e3-9e6a-4f3a-9733-87b476502c0a&amp;amp;secure%5Btoken%5D=50205cb66aa7d70addbe2ae3d6124b4a6072d484a31a7d441c48c04756fa7940&amp;amp;utm_campaign=gate-2162913" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="G2 Grid Winter 2026.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354253i3D29265FE68E6162/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="G2 Grid Winter 2026.png" alt="G2 Grid Winter 2026.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1699988453"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What makes SAP BTP different? &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The answer to this question is many-fold, as SAP BTP is a software platform comprising a range of technological capabilities. But given this blog concerns the results of customer reviews, rather than offering my opinion, perhaps I’d better leave that to the voice of the customer, so when asked “What do you like about SAP BTP” here’s what two recent reviewers said:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-right" style="text-align : right;"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“I like SAP BTP for its seamless integration, ready-to-use services, and flexibility. It helps build, scale, and extend applications quickly while keeping everything connected.” &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.g2.com/products/sap-business-technology-platform/reviews/sap-business-technology-platform-review-12016003" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Review posted&lt;/A&gt; 26 November 2025&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-right" style="text-align : right;"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“I like that BTP lets me build and integrate stuff without breaking the core system. Everything’s in one place, it plays nicely with SAP, and it actually works without turning into a mess.” &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.g2.com/products/sap-business-technology-platform/reviews/sap-business-technology-platform-review-12024736" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Review posted&lt;/A&gt; 29 November 2025&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1503474948"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Badge for all Seasons&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;As 2025 draws to a close, and we now look forward to 2026, it’s nice to know that we already have our Winter 2026 badges firmly in hand, to step positively into the New Year.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="G2 Winter 2026 Badges.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354254iF655F6A2F8D6412C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="G2 Winter 2026 Badges.png" alt="G2 Winter 2026 Badges.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope that you similarly have a good close to 2025 and positive start to 2026, and of course please don’t forget to go to the &lt;A href="https://www.g2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;G2 website&lt;/A&gt; and take a look at the many &lt;A href="https://www.g2.com/products/sap-business-technology-platform/reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP reviews&lt;/A&gt; available, and if you’re inclined please leave a review yourself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Chris Grundy, Product Marketing, SAP BTP&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Traditional rule-based automation struggles to keep up with modern business processes, which are constantly evolving and becoming more complex. Agentic AI helps handle dynamic workflows with adaptability. As previewed at TechEd 2025, the agent builder capability in Joule Studio empowers developers to create context-aware Joule agents that can plan, reason, and execute multi-step processes across diverse systems, with self-learning and high adaptability, unlocking new levels of productivity and efficiency across your enterprise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Today, building on the release of skill builder in Joule Studio earlier in 2025, we’re excited to make the agent builder in Joule Studio generally available. The agent builder enables developers to create Joule agents that are tailored to their unique business requirements and break cross-ecosystem silos and reduce barriers to AI adoption. This capability is powered by the same underlying agent framework and runtime that ready-to-use Joule agents do. That offers built-in data protection guardrails, deep reasoning models, and context retention across tasks for scalable, secure multi-agent executions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In this post, I’ll take you through what’s being released as part of the agent builder experience, how to create Joule agents in no time, and resources to help you get started. We’ll explore common use cases to transform business workflows with agentic AI and provide visibility into our roadmap. Together, these insights will help you move from isolated AI experiments to scalable, production-grade agents that deliver real business impact.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Key highlights of the release:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-guided development&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Generate Joule Agents using natural language with vibe coding&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP) support&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Connect to external tools and applications with support for MCP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Multi-agent orchestration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Add subagents&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; as a tool to allow agents to invoke them for planning and executing complex, multi-step workflows&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ground agents in business context&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Drive reliable outcomes by grounding agent reasoning in your documents&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Leverage your existing SAP Build content&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Embed pre-built custom skills, automations, and actions to accelerate time to value&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Human in the loop:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; ensure human oversight for critical decisions and approvals&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;"With Joule Studio, agentic innovation moves closer to the heart of operations. At KPMG, we’re helping to shape trusted solutions that transform business context into measurable value by building specialized AI agents for fulfillment orchestration, supply chain management, and more”.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Valentino Köster, Global Head of SAP360 Program &amp;amp; AI, KPMG AG WPG, Germany&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Meet Agent builder - the next evolution for Joule Studio&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule Studio is a capability in SAP Build that allows developers to design Joule agents and skills with a low code, no code canvas. Since it is part of SAP Build, Joule Studio has native access to all your connectors, automations, apps, and actions - enabling you to reuse artifacts, leverage shared APIs, and operate within a single governance framework. The agents created in Joule Studio work across their on-prem solutions including S/4 HANA and SAP ECC, SAP Cloud solutions, and third-party APIs and applications. Joule Studio leverages SAP Cloud Identity Services so that your agents have the right authorization and authentication for tasks that they are supposed to complete. It also enforces principal propagation, meaning the user’s identity in Joule is passed through end-to-end so that any triggered skill or agent runs strictly within that user’s security context, applying the same authorization checks and access restrictions. Moreover, it is integrated with Joule and AI core to seamlessly expose custom agents through Joule, empower agents with deep reasoning through models, and ground them in business data with document grounding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Image 1: Joule Studio Marketecture" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353224iE22DBAA26A54714F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Joule Studio architecture.jpg" alt="Image 1: Joule Studio Marketecture" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Image 1: Joule Studio Marketecture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Now &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;let's&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; dive into &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;key &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;features of agent builder in Joule Studio that simplifies the creation of powerful agents.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-guided development experience to fast-track deployment of AI agents&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule Studio brings AI guidance directly into the agent builder experience. Developers can describe what they need in plain language, and the Joule copilot responds with tailored suggestions for agent definitions, tools, and configuration options.&amp;nbsp; For instance, when building a logistics-focused agent, Joule may recommend a relevant Joule skill to fetch real-time stock levels and low-stock thresholds. This bridges the gap between simplicity and flexibility - empowering teams to innovate faster while maintaining full control over agent behavior.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Image 2: AI-guided development for building agents in Joule Studio" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353227i2CCBDE641720A0C3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Vibe coding_agent builder (1).png" alt="Image 2: AI-guided development for building agents in Joule Studio" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Image 2: AI-guided development for building agents in Joule Studio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced interoperability&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A major enhancement in Joule Studio is the newly added support for MCP - an open, standardized protocol that streamlines how AI agents interact with external systems. Instead of working within isolated applications, agents can now operate seamlessly across different platforms.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In Joule Studio, you can connect agents to external MCP servers via destinations, configured in BTP Cockpit. That enables custom agents to tap into tools and services outside the SAP ecosystem. For instance, a support agent built in Joule Studio can create or update purchase requests in an external purchase requisition tool that exposes its capabilities via MCP. This level of interoperability turns AI agents into intelligent orchestrators that can handle end-to-end workflows across multiple systems without requiring custom integrations or heavy engineering effort.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Image 3: Connecting custom Joule agents with third-party tools and applications using MCP" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353229i433242C0FA7603DC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MCPserver_figma.jpg" alt="Image 3: Connecting custom Joule agents with third-party tools and applications using MCP" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Image 3: Connecting custom Joule agents with third-party tools and applications using MCP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Creating multi-agent systems for complex workflows&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule Studio enables developers to build a modular “AI workforce” by allowing agents to be added as callable tools within other agents. Each agent can delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents built in Joule Studio and collaborate to solve much larger or more complex problems. This orchestration modularity avoids relying on a single, monolithic agent to handle everything and ensures clearer separation of responsibilities, simplifies testing and maintenance, and makes it far easier to scale agentic solutions as business needs evolve.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For example, an “Inventory Restocking Agent” can act as an orchestrator and delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents such as a “Contract Compliance Checker” to validate that each proposed restocking order aligns with supplier contract terms before it is placed. These specialized sub-agents are built with Joule Studio and serve as reusable resources for other agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Image 4: Adding other custom Joule agents built in Joule Studio as tools for other Joule agents" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353231i1A621FA757D1A836/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="agent as tool.png" alt="Image 4: Adding other custom Joule agents built in Joule Studio as tools for other Joule agents" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Image 4: Adding other custom Joule agents built in Joule Studio as tools for other Joule agents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;From an idea to an agent in few simple steps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule agents solve complex business challenges dynamically and intelligently. They excel in planning, reasoning, and autonomous execution, seamlessly navigating unknown paths with informed decision-making. Following are the key components of the agent definition:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Goals and instructions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: these act as job description for the agent and helps it understand its role and responsibilities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Planning and reasoning&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Large Language Models (LLMs) help agents plan and reason through the complex scenario&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Execution&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: agents need tools to interact with their environment and execute.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Agent builder in Joule Studio allows designing a Joule agent with all the needed components in a low code/no code canvas that empowers both professional and citizen developers, allowing for scalability, governance, and alignment with SAP’s clean-core principles.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The core steps include:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create a Project in SAP Build&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Access SAP Build lobby and select project type for Joule Studio: ‘Joule agent and skill’. After filling out meta data for Joule Studio project, within that, create AI Agent as an artifact.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Add Metadata&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Assign name and description for the agent. This meta data helps Joule to identify the right agent for the job based on user intent.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Define expertise and instructions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: these provide the agent with context on its role and guide the agent’s behavior and decision-making.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configure tools&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Select and configure the tools the agent can use to execute:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Servers&lt;/STRONG&gt;: connect agents to external tools and applications exposed via MCP server, using destinations configured in BTP Cockpit.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sub agents as a tool&lt;/STRONG&gt;: add other custom agents designed in Joule Studio as tools for one another, defining multi-agent systems for complex workflows.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule skills&lt;/STRONG&gt;: for executing rule-based, deterministic tasks&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Document grounding&lt;/STRONG&gt;: create resource groups in AI Core with your business documents, then add those resource groups as tools to your agent in Joule Studio. This grounds agents in business context needed for a workflow. For example, adding carrier contracts to a logistic agent for making informed decisions on carriers for optimizing shipment transport.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Human in the Loop&lt;/STRONG&gt;: human oversight is ensured by default for critical decisions and compliance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Calculator:&lt;/STRONG&gt; for mathematical calculations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Testing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: debug the agent in Joule Studio before deployment to see each step of its reasoning, actions and data flow, using mock conversations, tool-call scenarios and edge cases.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Release and deploy&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Once validated, deploy the agent into the designated environment, making it accessible to authorized users via Joule or other configured channels.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This modular approach not only accelerates development but also embeds governance controls - such as tool usage boundaries and human-in-the-loop checkpoints - directly into the design process, ensuring enterprise-grade reliability and flexibility.

They excel in scenarios where planning, reasoning, and adaptive execution are critical. Let’s explore some of common use cases for creating custom Joule agents:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Payroll variance analysis&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: An agent can simplify payroll variance analysis, a critical process for financial control and compliance, by instantly determining the source of variances, confirming allowances align with company policies, andreducing resolution time. This provides managers and payroll specialists with visibility into deviations, ensuring accuracy and confidence in payroll operations. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/from-days-to-minutes-how-epi-use-labs-custom-joule-agent-automates-payroll/ba-p/14254271" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Read more.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customer purchasing behavior analysis&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: An agent can help sales representatives quickly identify anomalies in customer purchasing behavior and assist in responding proactively to improve customer experience. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/beyond-poc-how-sovanta-detects-purchasing-anomalies-with-a-custom-joule/ba-p/14257926" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Read more&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Inventory management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: An agent can enable manufacturers and retailers to reduce losses from aging and obsolete inventory by turning inventory management into a proactive, data-driven process. For example, an agent can scan SAP S/4HANA data to detect early signs of obsolescence, categorize risk, and suggest actions such as redistribution or markdowns. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/10/820a9c8e-287f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Read more.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: An agent can interpret complex queries by retrieving accurate information instantly from enterprise systems, documents, and knowledge bases to surface the most relevant insights, and guide users step-by-step through processes. This reduces the dependency on manual lookups and helps users get the right answers quickly and consistently. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/how-thevaluechain-transforms-multitenant-solutions-with-q-amp-a-joule-agent/ba-p/14249033" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Read more&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Logistics&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: An agent can optimize delivery routes based on real-time traffic data, weather conditions, and carrier availability, enhancing efficiency and reducing transportation costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Nestle, SAP, and IBM worked together on a supply chain Agentic AI PoC.

This makes vibe coding particularly useful for rapid prototyping, experimentation, and learning how agents reason across multiple skills.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;In this section, we will recreate the same stock validation agent built earlier, but this time using vibe coding, to&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;demonstrate&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;how quickly an end-to-end agent can be assembled once the fundamentals are understood.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Step&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;10&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;: The "Vibe Coding" Alternative – Speed to Market&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Open the Assistant:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;Click the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Joule Chat&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;icon inside the Agent Editor.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="chanchal_gopalakrishnan_13-1766039434467.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353423i7BB616E9D93BD190/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="chanchal_gopalakrishnan_13-1766039434467.png" alt="chanchal_gopalakrishnan_13-1766039434467.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Prompt the Vibe&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;"&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Create an agent that is able to validate maintenance orders, check material stock, and recommend actions to ensure fulfillment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Include all available skills and use all the information you have (from the description and skills) to formulate&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;expertise&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, fully describe the process in instructions and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;additional&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;context.”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="chanchal_gopalakrishnan_14-1766039515450.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353424i56426D53E03E62BD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="chanchal_gopalakrishnan_14-1766039515450.png" alt="chanchal_gopalakrishnan_14-1766039515450.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="chanchal_gopalakrishnan_16-1766039637180.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/353427iCAC56D3639E8C437/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="chanchal_gopalakrishnan_16-1766039637180.png" alt="chanchal_gopalakrishnan_16-1766039637180.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Confirm Generation:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Joule generates the Instructions and Expertise automatically.

To make the work of our employees and sales team easier, we set out to simplify how users interact with Summarix&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;’&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;s structured data. Out of this ambition, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, our AI-powered chatbot, was born.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We realized this project &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;in close collaboration with SAP through the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Early Adopter Care (EAC) Program&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP HANA Knowledge Graph Engine&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;, &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;a powerful extension of the SAP HANA&amp;nbsp;database.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the following&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; sections&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, we &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;will &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;share &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;details of the&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Summy&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; project&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, the challenges we &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;encountered&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, and the technical decisions that shaped the solution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763639750"&gt;The Challenge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Summarix already provided a user-friendly UI with filtering and search capabilities built on &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;,&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Cloud+Application+Programming+Model/pd-p/9f13aee1-834c-4105-8e43-ee442775e5ce" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="100-1"&gt;SAP Cloud Application Programming Model&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(CAP)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and deployed on &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Business+Technology+Platform/pd-p/73555000100700000172" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1215-1"&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(BTP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

Since each skill has a canonical name in Summarix, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;robust entity matching&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; is required&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;O&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ur approach, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;involved&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; the following steps:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extract potential entities (skills, employees, projects&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; customers) from the question via an LLM using few-shot learning.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Normalize entity names (singular form, multiple known variations).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Search with regex-based case-insensitive filters for the existing entities.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After matching the entities, we store&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; them in the agent state for subsequent steps.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="fhueni_4-1761227317514.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/331670iC87A8D824879E195/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="fhueni_4-1761227317514.png" alt="fhueni_4-1761227317514.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-910154944"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SPARQL Query Generation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After identifying the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;entities &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, the next step is to generate a SPARQL query. To guide the LLM, we did a lot of context engineering and provide:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Context such as identity, instructions, and current date/time.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;full ontology&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; of the knowledge graph, including attributes and relationships.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Detailed &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;descriptions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;of &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;all attributes, entities and relations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Examples of valid SPARQL queries.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For this step, we (currently) rely on &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;GPT-4.1&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for its stronger reasoning capabilities, while lighter calls use &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;GPT-4o-mini&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We chose to use a knowledge graph approach, although it would also be possible to directly generate SQL and execute queries against the relational SAP HANA Cloud database. In our experiments, answers based on SQL queries showed slightly lower performance compared to those derived from the knowledge graph approach.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-713641439"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Evaluation and Observability&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;From day one,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, we prioritized evaluation &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;at inpeek&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;to avoid a “black-box” development process and &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;to establish&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;clear KPIs &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;and track &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;their development over time.

is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm used to simplify complex, high-dimensional feature spaces, while preserving its essential structure. It is widely considered the modern gold standard for visualizing targeted dimension reduction of large-scale datasets, because it balances computational speed with the ability to maintain both local and global relationships.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It reduces thousands of variables (dimensions) into 2D or 3D scatter plots that humans can easily interpret.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Unlike comparable methods like t-SNE, UMAP is better at preserving global structure, meaning the relative positions between different clusters remain more meaningful.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than t-SNE, capable of processing datasets with millions of points in a reasonable timeframe.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It can be used as a "transformer" preprocessing step in Machine Learning scenarios to reduce large feature spaces before applying clustering (e.g., k-means, HDBSCAN) or classification models, often improving their performance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Calculating pairwise distances &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many algorithms, for example clustering algorithms utilize distance matrixes as a preprocessing step, often inbuild the functions. Often there is the wish to decouple though the distance matrix calculation from the follow-up task like the actual clustering. Moreover, if decoupled custom calculated matrixes can be fed into algorithms as input.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Most PAL clustering functions support to feed-in a pre-calculated similarity matrix&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, a pairwise &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-predictive-analysis-library/distance-md?version=LATEST&amp;amp;q=distance&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;distance calculation function&lt;/A&gt; is provided&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It supports distance metrics like &lt;EM&gt;Manhattan, Euclidien, Minkowski, Chebyshey&lt;/EM&gt; as well as &lt;EM&gt;Levenshtein&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Levenshtein distance&lt;/STRONG&gt; (or edit distance) is a distance metric specifically targeting distance between text-columns. It calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) needed to transform one word into another, acting as a measure of their similarity. A lower distance indicates a higher similarity.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Applicable use cases&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is useful in data cleaning, table column similarity analysis between columns of the same data type.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After calculating the column similarity across all data types, clustering like K-Means can be applied to group similar fields and propose mappings for fields within the same cluster&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Again, an incredible set of enhancements in the SAP HANA Cloud database AI engine and NLP services!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enjoy to try out all the enhancements and let us know what you think here!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;(Jana Subramanian&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;serves as Head of Cybersecurity and Compliance for SEA and is a Fellow of Information Privacy (FIP), awarded by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). In this role, Jana supports strategic customer engagements on cybersecurity, data privacy, multi-cloud security integration architecture, contractual assurance, audit, and compliance.)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI is no longer an isolated innovation experiment in enterprises. It is becoming deeply embedded in core business processes. In the SAP ecosystem, this evolution has created a rich but multi-layered landscape: embedded machine learning in applications, side-by-side AI on SAP BTP,&amp;nbsp; generative AI via SAP Generative AI Hub and Joule as an AI copilot. A common question from customers, architects, and privacy professionals alike is: “What architectural models sit behind SAP Business AI use cases, and what are the trust boundaries for my data and the security of data flows in SAP Business AI?”&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog answers that question by explaining SAP Business AI through clear architecture patterns. Each pattern is designed for different business needs, risk levels, and degrees of customization. Instead of individual products, we focus on how data flows, where intelligence runs, how access is controlled, and how compliance is maintained. This blog is intended for conceptual understanding, not detailed configuration guidance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Embedded AI &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Embedded AI architecture pattern represents SAP’s approach to executing machine learning directly within the cloud applications system boundary such as S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors or other cloud applications. In this model, intelligence is built into the digital core itself rather than being consumed from external AI services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When a user action or business process triggers a prediction request, the ABAP application layer does not transmit data outside the system. Instead, it invokes Intelligent Scenario Lifecycle Management (ISLM), which determines the appropriate machine learning scenario, model version, and execution logic. ISLM then orchestrates execution within the SAP HANA database, where algorithms from the Predictive Analysis Library (PAL) or Automated Predictive Library (APL) run in-memory, directly alongside the transactional data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the prediction is computed, the result flows back through ISLM to the ABAP layer and is immediately consumed by the business process. At no point does enterprise data leave the S/4HANA trust boundary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The critical advantage of this pattern is zero data movement. Sensitive business data remains entirely within the S/4HANA system, making Embedded AI the strongest posture for strict data-minimization / no-egress requirements and deterministic option for transaction-specific, real-time predictions such as credit risk scoring, demand forecasting, delivery date prediction, or invoice blocking decisions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Secure Data Flow &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User/Process&lt;/STRONG&gt; triggers a prediction in the business process.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP application layer&lt;/STRONG&gt; initiates the ML call (often via DB-proximate execution).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ISLM orchestration / scenario management&lt;/STRONG&gt; selects the scenario/model.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HANA executes PAL/APL algorithms&lt;/STRONG&gt; next to the business data (in-memory).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prediction result&lt;/STRONG&gt; returns to the business process.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Fig 1 - Embedded AI .png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354512i45FEBD57FE3FD93A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Fig 1 - Embedded AI .png" alt="Fig 1 - Embedded AI .png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Aspect&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How Embedded AI Addresses It&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Residency&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;All processing occurs within the customer’s S/4HANA instance. Data never crosses network boundaries or leaves the system landscape, supporting strict data sovereignty and localization requirements (for example, GDPR and regional regulations).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Access Control&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Embedded AI leverages existing SAP authorization concepts (roles, profiles, authorization objects). Users can only access predictions for business objects they are already authorized to view or process—no separate IAM layer is required.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Audit Trail&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;ISLM maintains comprehensive logs covering model training, deployment, and inference execution. These integrate with SAP’s standard logging and audit mechanisms (for example, application logs and system logs) to support compliance and audit reporting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Encryption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data protection relies on SAP HANA’s native encryption mechanisms for data at rest and in transit. No additional encryption layers are required, as data does not leave the internal system boundary.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Model Governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;ISLM enforces model lifecycle governance, including version control, approval workflows, and transport management. ML models follow the same change and release controls as ABAP code, ensuring consistent governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Third-Party Exposure&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unlike side-by-side AI or external LLM patterns, no data is transmitted to third-party AI providers. This eliminates external vendor trust dependencies and reduces the need for additional data processing agreements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Side-by-side AI inference on SAP BTP using SAP AI Core&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;This pattern keeps the digital core clean by running AI inference side-by-side on SAP BTP. A user interacts with a Fiori app, the request is handled by a BTP application (CAP/Node.js), and inference is executed in SAP AI Core inside a managed runtime (Docker container). The important security idea is that the user does not call the model directly. The BTP application is the controlled middleware that enforces authentication, authorization, and data minimization before sending anything for inference.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Request Initiation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A user interacts with an SAP Fiori Application, which triggers an inference request (e.g., a text prompt or data for classification).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;CAP Middleware Layer:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The request is sent to a Cloud Application Programming (CAP) model or Node.js service.

Instead of exposing applications directly to LLMs, the GenAI Hub enforces a controlled, policy-driven interaction model.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The core flow for a secure user request includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Prompt Templating: User prompts are normalized into approved templates with placeholders, ensuring consistency, reuse, and protection against prompt injection.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data Masking (Anonymization): Sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII), is dynamically masked or pseudonymized before the request is sent to the LLM.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Content Filtering: Input and output filters inspect prompts and responses for unsafe, biased, or non-compliant content in line with SAP Responsible AI principles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data Re-identification: After a safe response is returned, previously masked data may be selectively re-identified to restore business context for the end user, subject to policy controls.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This orchestration layer ensures customer data is minimized, protected, and never persistently stored or used for model training by external LLMs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Fig 5 - Orchestartion Services.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354518i479083C6C5A7110A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Fig 5 - Orchestartion Services.png" alt="Fig 5 - Orchestartion Services.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP AI Core: Execution &amp;amp; Lifecycle Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the GenAI Hub governs interaction and policy enforcement, SAP AI Core provides the standardized runtime for executing AI workloads on SAP Business Technology Platform. Key capabilities include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Model Serving: Machine learning models are deployed as scalable, secure inference services with managed lifecycle operations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Container-Based Execution: Custom AI workloads are packaged and deployed using Docker containers, enabling Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) scenarios with frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tenant Isolation: AI Core enforces strict isolation between tenants, ensuring that models, data, and execution environments remain segregated across customers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP AI Core ensures operational consistency, scalability, and security across both SAP-delivered and customer-developed AI use cases.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine: Grounding with Business Context&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A key risk of generative AI is hallucination—responses that are fluent but not factually grounded. SAP addresses this using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). SAP HANA Cloud provides native vector capabilities that enable secure grounding of LLM responses in enterprise data:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Embeddings &amp;amp; Similarity Search: Unstructured content (such as documents, policies, or contracts) is converted into vector embeddings and stored in the HANA Cloud Vector Engine.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Grounded Retrieval: When a user prompt is processed, a similarity search retrieves the most relevant business context, which is injected into the LLM prompt—ensuring the generated response is based on authoritative, company-specific data. This approach significantly reduces hallucination risk while keeping enterprise data within SAP’s controlled data boundary.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Centralized Control Plane: Scaling SAP Business AI Through GenAI Hub&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This diagram shows a practical way to scale SAP Business AI securely: SAP applications consume AI through a single governed layer (GenAI Hub), while execution can happen either in SAP AI Core (including BYOM) or via approved external model providers. The key architectural decision here is to avoid "point-to-point AI integrations" where every app team separately manages model endpoints, credentials, and logging. Instead, GenAI Hub becomes the orchestration, trust, control, and routing layer—centralizing authentication/authorization, selecting the right model for each use case, and ensuring consistent telemetry across the landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Happens Under the Hood (Data Flow)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A user triggers an AI feature from SAP applications such as S/4HANA, SuccessFactors, Ariba, or SAP Fiori.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The request is sent to GenAI Hub, which acts as the enterprise gateway for GenAI requests. At this point, GenAI Hub applies centralized controls: who is calling, what they are allowed to do, and which model endpoints are permitted. Critically, SAP applications never connect directly to LLM providersall requests flow through GenAI Hub, ensuring no credentials, tokens, or business data bypass the governance layer.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GenAI Hub then routes the request down one of two execution paths:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;External approved model providers&lt;/STRONG&gt; (e.g., Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, other approved models) when the use case allows external inference and the right provider is configured.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP AI Core&lt;/STRONG&gt; when you need SAP-managed runtime governance, want to run custom/BYOM models (PyTorch, TensorFlow), or require data to remain entirely within SAP's infrastructure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For grounding use cases (RAG), the flow can retrieve enterprise context from HANA Cloud Vector Engine, using vector indexing and similarity search to fetch the most relevant snippets. This makes responses more accurate and reduces hallucinations because the model is guided by trusted enterprise context rather than relying on the base model alone.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The response returns through GenAI Hub back to the calling SAP application.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security, Privacy, and AI Safety — Why This Pattern Matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From a cybersecurity perspective, this design reduces attack surface by centralizing sensitive controls in one place. Authentication and authorization are enforced at the orchestration layer, model access is restricted to approved endpoints, and telemetry is standardized so security teams can monitor usage patterns, spikes, and anomalous behavior. When BYOM is used, SAP AI Core provides a managed container runtime where organizations can apply enterprise controls such as hardened images, secrets isolation, environment separation, and controlled deployment lifecycles. Importantly, SAP AI Launchpad provides the operational governance layer for AI Core (deploy, monitor, scale), helping prevent uncontrolled model changes in production.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From a data privacy and safety standpoint, the architecture supports "minimum necessary data" and better guardrails. Only required context should be sent for inference, and where external providers are used, this pattern naturally supports adding a trust layer (masking/tokenization and input/output filtering) before any data leaves the SAP boundary. SAP maintains strict contractual agreements with all external LLM providers, explicitly prohibiting customer data from being used for model training or retention beyond the inference session. For RAG, the vector store becomes a governed enterprise memory: the most important safety control is to ensure retrieval is authorization-aware, so users only see content they are entitled to access. Combined, these controls help customers adopt GenAI faster without losing control over data handling, residency decisions, auditability, and safety outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Fig 6 - Scaling SAP Business AI.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354521i476F497CC788648D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Fig 6 - Scaling SAP Business AI.png" alt="Fig 6 - Scaling SAP Business AI.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enforcing Trust Boundaries in SAP Joule’s AI Execution Flow&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;SAP Joule is a generative AI co-pilot natively embedded across SAP's cloud portfolio, including SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Ariba, and SAP Concur.

As a result, Joule can only perform actions and retrieve data that the user is already authorized to access in the native SAP application.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Role-Based Access Control&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule does not introduce a separate permission model.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It inherits role-based access control (RBAC) from the connected SAP applications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Authorization checks are enforced before any data access or function execution&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted interactions are consistent with direct application access&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If a user cannot view data or execute a transaction in an SAP application, Joule will enforce the same restriction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Encryption and Transport Security&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All communication involving Joule is protected using strong encryption:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;TLS 1.2 or higher for all data in transit&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Secure communication with:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP backend systems (e.g., S/4HANA Cloud, SuccessFactors)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Generative AI Hub&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Approved third-party LLM providers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data at rest within SAP-managed cloud infrastructure is encrypted, with encryption keys handled through SAP’s centralized key management services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proactive Security and Continuous Governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP applies multiple layers of proactive security controls to Joule:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Penetration Testing and Red Teaming Regular security testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Third-Party LLM Risk Management All LLM integrations undergo security, privacy, compliance, and ethical risk assessments before enablement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Continuous Monitoring Real-time monitoring and incident response capabilities across SAP BTP and Joule services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;These measures ensure Joule remains resilient against evolving threats while meeting enterprise and regulatory expectations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business AI Architecture Comparison&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even though SAP builds the AI architecture, customer, remain the pilot in command for risk acceptance and regulatory compliance. Understanding the "trust boundaries" of SAP Business AI allows customer to have informed conversations with your CISO, legal, and risk teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Four Critical Questions Every Leader Should Ask:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data Residency: Where does my enterprise data stay, and where does it move during processing?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Execution Layer: Does this AI run inside the core system or on the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Grounding Method: Is the response purely generated by the model, or is it grounded in my specific business data?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Governance: What specific audit controls and security guardrails is SAP applying to this process?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business AI spans multiple architectural patterns, ranging from deterministic, in-stack machine learning to governed generative AI. Internally, SAP already maps every AI capability to one of these models based on:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The nature of the use case&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Data sensitivity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Execution requirements&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Regulatory and compliance considerations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Embedded AI scenarios in SAP S/4HANA operate entirely within the digital core, with no data leaving the system boundary.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Side-by-side AI scenarios execute on SAP Business Technology Platform, where SAP applications enforce authentication, authorization, and data minimization before invoking AI services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Generative AI scenarios that interact with enterprise data are implemented using secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), ensuring responses are grounded in authorized business context.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enterprise-scale copilots and cross-application AI capabilities are governed centrally through SAP GenAI Hub, with SAP AI Core providing controlled execution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customers enable these models by activating AI use cases, not by architecting them.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;TABLE&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business I Use Case Dimension&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Embedded AI (In-App)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Side-by-Side AI on SAP BTP&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Secure RAG with GenAI Hub&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;GenAI Hub + AI Core (Advanced GenAI)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Primary Goal&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Deterministic, real-time predictions inside core processes&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Extend applications with AI without touching the digital core&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ground generative AI in enterprise data&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enterprise-scale generative AI with governance&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Where AI Runs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Inside S/4HANA (HANA PAL/APL)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP AI Core (BTP)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP AI Core + HANA Cloud Vector Engine&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP AI Core (runtime) + GenAI Hub (governance)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data Movement&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;None (zero data movement)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Controlled data transfer from app to AI Core&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Context retrieved first, then sent to LLM&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Context and prompts routed via GenAI Hub&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Trust Boundary&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Single system boundary (S/4HANA)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP BTP trust boundary&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP BTP + customer-controlled vector store&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP-governed AI boundary across models&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data Sensitivity Fit&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Very high (regulated transactional data)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;High (filtered and minimized)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;High (authorization-aware grounding)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Medium–High (with masking &amp;amp;

This flexibility is backed by a consistent contractual and security framework for data processing, so customers have a predictable baseline across patterns. The intent is straightforward: whether AI is embedded in an application, hosted in SAP AI Core, or accessed via an approved external provider, the same privacy and security expectations should hold. When external models are involved, the architecture should add explicit protections data minimization and masking before egress, plus input/output filtering and continuous monitoring to reduce exposure risk and keep responses safe, compliant, and operationally governed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;© 2025 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

Since SAP HANA Cloud QRC 04/2024, SAP HANA Cloud has supported read-only access to external Delta Sharing with a dedicated &lt;EM&gt;deltasharing&lt;/EM&gt; adapter, as I introduced in my previous &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/exploring-new-sql-on-files-use-cases-with-sap-hana-cloud-qrc-04-2024-and/ba-p/14076223" target="_self"&gt;blog&lt;/A&gt;. This capability has been instrumental in enabling real-time analytics without physically moving data, unlocking efficiency and delivering faster insights. But what if your business cases demand not just seamless access but also replication of critical datasets into SAP HANA Cloud for deeper analysis, faster queries, or advanced integration?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That’s where Delta table-to-HANA replication comes in. Starting with SAP HANA Cloud QRC 04/2025, I’m glad to introduce this new capability, which provides more flexibility to replicate your Delta table directly into the SAP HANA database in SAP HANA Cloud, empowering your analytics with greater speed, reliability, and robust data management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In a nutshell, the new Delta table-to-HANA replication has the following capabilities and characteristics:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Remote subscription-based initial load and Change Data Capture (CDC) for both &lt;EM&gt;file&lt;/EM&gt; adapter and &lt;EM&gt;deltasharing&lt;/EM&gt; adapter.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support for either chunk-based, user-driven initial load or streamlined, one-step initial load.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support for either user-driven CDC or system-scheduled CDC using the replication job scheduler.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Offer both column-wise and row-wise sub-table replication while enabling source-side schema changes (adding columns only).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In addition to normal load behavior, UPSERT load behavior with three additional metadata columns: type, last-processed time, and Delta table version.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Simplified replication with virtual table toggling and Data Replication UI for the &lt;EM&gt;deltasharing&lt;/EM&gt; adapter in addition to the remote subscription-based replication.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Overview.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351959iDFF5837625A9F808/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Overview.png" alt="Overview.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As depicted in the diagram above, the following four combinations can be considered based on the business use case:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Chunk-based Initial Load → User-driven CDC&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Chunk-based Initial Load → Scheduled CDC&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;One-step Initial Load → User-driven CDC&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;One-step initial Load → Scheduled CDC&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the one-step initial load is more straightforward and intuitive, chunk-based initial load is useful when the data volume during the initial load is large. With chunk-based initial load, users can have more granular control over the process by splitting the data into multiple chunks and loading them separately. This approach makes the initial load more manageable and easier to handle, especially when dealing with a vast volume of data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the initial load is complete, Change Data Capture (CDC) is required to reflect any data changes on the source side. User-driven CDC allows users to replicate data based on a specific version. This can be particularly useful when the exact Delta table version for replication is known, and there is no need to automatically replicate all the latest changes. Alternatively, scheduled CDC can be used if the use case involves automatic replication at specific time intervals. In this scenario, the default time interval is 3,600 seconds (1 hour), but custom values can be configured as needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, let’s dive deeper into the details with some examples. For this, I will use the combination of chunk-based initial load and scheduled CDC with Delta Sharing as the remote source, which is expected to be the most common scenario. However, as explained, other combinations or setups with direct object storage access can also be easily configured by following the linked documentation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1896381028"&gt;Chunk-based Initial Load&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;As the focus of this blog is Delta table-to-HANA replication, let’s assume that the remote source to Delta Sharing has already been created and data is accessible via a virtual table. If you’re not familiar with this, please refer to my previous blogs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="V_ORDERS.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351960iB62FD076F4331B12/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="V_ORDERS.png" alt="V_ORDERS.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="V_ORDERS Records.png" style="width: 410px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351961i5126C9098FA11E22/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="V_ORDERS Records.png" alt="V_ORDERS Records.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this example, a virtual table, V_ORDERS, is created by pointing to the remote shared table within Delta Sharing, and it contains 1,500,000 records.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first step is to create an empty table as the replication target, using the virtual table schema for its definition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- create a target table using the virtual table schema for the definition
CREATE TABLE DEMO.R_ORDERS LIKE DEMO.V_ORDERS;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this, a remote subscription can now be created as shown below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- create a remote subscription
CREATE REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION DEMO.DELTA_SUBSCRIPTION ON DEMO.V_ORDERS TARGET TABLE DEMO.R_ORDERS;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here, if needed, as briefly mentioned, column-wise or row-wise sub-table replication can be configured by using a subquery with the &lt;CODE&gt;CREATE REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION ... ON ... AS &amp;lt;subquery&amp;gt; TARGET TABLE ...;&lt;/CODE&gt;. Additionally, enabling source-side schema changes (adding columns only) or&amp;nbsp;defining load behaviors can also be done together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once a remote subscription is created, we now have two options: the chunk-based initial load and the one-step initial load. In this example, I will use the chunk-based initial load.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- prepare the initial load by defining the chunk size
ALTER REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION DEMO.DELTA_SUBSCRIPTION INITIAL LOAD PREPARE CHUNK SIZE 10;

-- retrieve the chunk information
SELECT * FROM M_REMOTE_SUBSCRIPTION_INITIAL_LOADS;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this example, I set the chunk size to 10, which is 10 MiB. However, it is also possible not to define the chunk size here, as in the statement &lt;CODE&gt;ALTER REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION DEMO.DELTA_SUBSCRIPTION INITIAL LOAD PREPARE;&lt;/CODE&gt;. If the chunk size is not specified, the default size of 100 MiB will be used.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If I check the chunk information in the M_REMOTE_SUBSCRIPTION_INITIAL_LOADS monitoring view, the result is as follows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Chunk Information.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351964iB6FE45F0168C5F1A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Chunk Information.png" alt="Chunk Information.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As you can see, three chunks with CHUNK_IDs 1, 2, and 3 are defined, and each chunk contains approximately 430,000 to 537,000 records, respectively. The EXECUTION_STATUS column indicates whether a chunk has been loaded or not. Since I haven’t loaded any of them yet, all of them show as PREPARED.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, let me load chunks 1 and 2 first.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- load chunks 1 and 2
ALTER REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION DEMO.DELTA_SUBSCRIPTION INITIAL LOAD EXECUTE CHUNK 1, 2;

-- retrieve the chunk information
SELECT * FROM M_REMOTE_SUBSCRIPTION_INITIAL_LOADS;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since only chunks 1 and 2 are loaded, the EXECUTION_STATUS in the monitoring view now shows LOADED for those two chunks, as shown below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Chunk 1 and 2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351965iF88EE837C1664D40/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Chunk 1 and 2.png" alt="Chunk 1 and 2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this way, each chunk can be loaded as desired, and its status can be monitored. With that, let me load the last chunk and finalize the initial load.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- load the chunk 3
ALTER REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION DEMO.DELTA_SUBSCRIPTION INITIAL LOAD EXECUTE CHUNK 3;

-- finalize the initial load
ALTER REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION DEMO.DELTA_SUBSCRIPTION INITIAL LOAD FINALIZE;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;All chunks must be marked as LOADED in EXECUTION_STATUS to finalize the initial load. FINALIZE will also delete all corresponding rows in the M_REMOTE_SUBSCRIPTION_INITIAL_LOADS monitoring view. Now, I can see that all data has been loaded into the R_ORDERS table.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="R_ORDERS.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351966i569AE2EB3813D86F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="R_ORDERS.png" alt="R_ORDERS.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please refer to the links below for further details on the initial load.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database SQL on Files Guide: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-sql-on-files-guide/setting-up-data-replication" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Configuring Delta Table Replication&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database SQL on Files Guide: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-sql-on-files-guide/performing-initial-load" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Performing an Initial Load&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1699867523"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Scheduled CDC&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once the initial load is finalized, CDC can be achieved in two ways: user-driven CDC or scheduled CDC. In this example, I will use the scheduled CDC.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- scheduled CDC with a 30-minute interval (1,800 seconds)
ALTER REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION DEMO.DELTA_SUBSCRIPTION DISTRIBUTE INTERVAL 1800;

-- retrieve the replication jobs
SELECT * FROM M_REMOTE_REPLICATION_JOBS;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If the interval is not specified, the default time interval of 3,600 seconds (1 hour) will be used. In this example, completed and planned replication jobs can be retrieved via the M_REMOTE_REPLICATION_JOBS monitoring view.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Replication Jobs.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/351969iBA4F4D01C53FA09C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Replication Jobs.png" alt="Replication Jobs.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As shown above, the first CDC job was planned for 05:35:19 and completed successfully. The next job is planned for 06:05:19, which is 30 minutes later, as expected. One important note is that, to execute the DISTRIBUTE, the &lt;EM&gt;enableChangeDataFeed&lt;/EM&gt; property must be set on the source Delta table.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please refer to the links below for further details on the CDC.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database SQL on Files Guide: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-sql-on-files-guide/performing-system-scheduled-delta-replication" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Performing System-scheduled CDC Replication&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database SQL on Files Guide: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-sql-on-files-guide/performing-user-driven-delta-replication" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Performing User-driven CDC Replication&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1503354018"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Deactivate and Drop Remote Subscription&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If needed, the configured remote subscription can be deactivated and dropped using the statements below.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- deactivate the remote subscription
ALTER REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION DEMO.DELTA_SUBSCRIPTION RESET;

-- drop the remote subscription 
DROP REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION DEMO.DELTA_SUBSCRIPTION;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Deactivating the remote subscription will cancel all planned replication jobs from the scheduled CDC. However, since the remote subscription itself remains active, you can start again from the initial load step. Please note that the replica table, R_ORDERS in this example, will still contain replicated data. Therefore, truncating the replica table is required to start over.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Dropping the remote subscription will delete all entries, including the monitoring views. However, the replica table, R_ORDERS in this example, will remain with the replicated data and can be used as a normal table.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please refer to the links below for further details on the deactivation and drop.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database SQL on Files Guide: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-sql-on-files-guide/setting-up-data-replication" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Configuring Delta Table Replication&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1306840513"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Other Interfaces&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The remote subscription-based initial load and CDC combination mentioned above is the primary interface used for Delta table-to-HANA replication. However, there are a couple of other interfaces with simplified steps.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first option involves toggling between federation and replication for the virtual table. Toggling has been supported previously, but only with snapshot replication. Starting with QRC 04/2025, toggling now supports real-time replication as well, as shown below.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-sql"&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- add a system-owned replica to a virtual table with a 30-minute interval
ALTER VIRTUAL TABLE V_ORDERS ADD SHARED REPLICA REFRESH INTERVAL 1800;

-- delete a replica
ALTER VIRTUAL TABLE V_ORDERS DROP REPLICA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this approach, any queries on the virtual table will retrieve data from the replica instead of fetching data on-the-fly from the remote table. Since this is a simplified one-step process designed to offer better performance while maintaining the target object as a virtual table, it does not support granular controls such as chunk-based initial load or sub-table replication. The above example illustrates a system-owned replica, but a user-owned replica is also supported. Here, as with the remote subscription-based approach, if REFRESH INTERVAL is not specified, the default time interval of 3,600 seconds (1 hour) will be used.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please refer to the links below for further details on the toggling.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database SQL on Files Guide: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-sql-on-files-guide/toggle-between-virtual-tables-and-replica-tables" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Toggling Between Virtual Tables and Replica Tables&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Another interface involves using the SAP HANA Cloud Central UI. In SAP HANA Cloud Central, Data Replication has been utilized for hybrid scenarios, such as replicating data from SAP HANA Platform 2.0 to SAP HANA Cloud. Starting with QRC 04/2025, Data Replication now also supports replicating data from Delta Sharing to SAP HANA Cloud.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Data Replication UI.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352441iFCD45B6FDED11C67/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Data Replication UI.png" alt="Data Replication UI.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Connection Type.png" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352442i865149D5728D6148/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Connection Type.png" alt="Connection Type.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this UI, either an existing remote source for Delta Sharing can be used or a new remote source can be created while configuring replication.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Connection Properties.png" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352443i99DAF8C767F2D63A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Connection Properties.png" alt="Connection Properties.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Unlike other interfaces, it only supports the Delta Sharing remote source, which is based on the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;deltasharing&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; adapter.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Data-Object Replication.png" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352445i99BF9C3CA75CF340/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Data-Object Replication.png" alt="Data-Object Replication.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As shown above, once the data objects to be replicated are selected, the replication schedule can be set to either 'Real Time', which uses scheduled CDC, or 'None', which performs only a one-time initial load.&amp;nbsp;For 'Real Time', as explained above, the &lt;EM&gt;enableChangeDataFeed&lt;/EM&gt; property must be set on the source Delta table.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Replication Monitoring.png" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352451iA1336FB6F22BCD6E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Replication Monitoring.png" alt="Replication Monitoring.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once confirmed, the replication status can now be monitored. For example, 'Completed', which means the one-time initial load is finished, or 'Loading...', which indicates that scheduled CDC is being activated.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Similar to toggling, as it is a simplified approach, it does not support granular controls such as chunk-based initial load, sub-table replication, or setting time intervals. However, like existing SAP HANA Platform 2.0-to-SAP HANA Cloud hybrid scenarios, it provides a way to configure the replication schedule, storage type, and a consolidated view of all replication tasks.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) does not provide a native, built-in Sankey chart as part of its standard visualization catalog. As a result, Sankey-style visualizations in SAC are typically implemented using custom widgets.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In mid-2024, while working on an enterprise analytics engagement, I encountered a requirement to visualize:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Top N parent entities (for example, service providers)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And, for each parent, the Top M child entities independently ranked per parent (for example, services offered)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;All of this needed to be displayed within a single Sankey visualization, enabling users to immediately understand concentration and distribution patterns without navigating multiple charts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To address this requirement, I explored SAC’s Custom Widget framework and extended an existing SAP-provided sample Sankey custom widget into a production-ready solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have intentionally included the development and deployment steps in detail so that consultants or developers who are completely new to Sankey custom widgets in SAP Analytics Cloud can deploy and validate the solution end-to-end by following this blog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Sample Sankey Custom Widget as the Starting Point&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since SAP Analytics Cloud does not include a native Sankey chart, I referred to a sample Sankey custom widget implementation shared by SAP through the SAP Community. This SAP-provided sample demonstrates how a Sankey diagram can be rendered using the SAC Custom Widget framework and served as a technical starting point for my work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP sample was very helpful as a technical reference, as it illustrated:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Custom widget structure and lifecycle&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Binding SAC model data to a widget&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Rendering a Sankey diagram using JavaScript&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;During mid-2024, while actively working on this requirement, I engaged in the comments section of that SAP Community blog (&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-analytics-cloud-custom-widget-amp-widget-add-ons-samples-preview/bc-p/13917451#M176481" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Analytics Cloud: Custom Widget &amp;amp; Widget Add-Ons Samples Preview&lt;/A&gt;)&amp;nbsp;under my SAP Community user&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/828979"&gt;@GovindaRaoBanothu45&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;, discussing feasibility and implementation boundaries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the sample clarified the basic rendering approach, it also highlighted functional gaps when applied to enterprise-scale analytical requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why the SAP Sample Sankey Widget Was Not Sufficient&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP-provided Sankey custom widget was intentionally designed as a generic sample. Its behavior was to render all nodes and all links returned by the bound dataset.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, the sample widget did not support the enterprise analytical requirement I was addressing, specifically:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No Top-N filtering at the parent level&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No independent ranking of child nodes per parent&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;No data trimming prior to Sankey rendering&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Limited usability for large, real-world datasets&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a result, while the SAP sample demonstrated &lt;EM&gt;how&lt;/EM&gt; to render a Sankey chart, it did not meet the analytical or usability needs of an enterprise dashboard.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This gap required extending and enhancing the SAP sample Sankey custom widget with additional, original logic to reshape the dataset &lt;EM&gt;before&lt;/EM&gt; rendering.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;High-Level Architecture of the Extended Sankey Widget&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GovindaRaoBanothu45_0-1766472320540.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354864iB98389D5B5D57B5E/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GovindaRaoBanothu45_0-1766472320540.png" alt="GovindaRaoBanothu45_0-1766472320540.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Sankey rendering mechanism remains aligned with the SAP sample, while the data-transformation layer represents the core extension.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Development Environment and Prerequisites&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To get started, ensure that you have:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Access to SAP Analytics Cloud with Optimized Design Experience enabled&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Node.js installed on your local machine&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Basic understanding of JavaScript and JSON&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Development Environment Setup&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Install Node.js&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Download Node.js from: &lt;A href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://nodejs.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Verify installation:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;node -v

This folder contains all the supporting and required files needed to build and deploy the Sankey custom widget in SAP Analytics Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The project folder includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;main.js&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The web component JavaScript file that contains the core widget logic and Sankey rendering code (mandatory).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;index.json&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The metadata file that defines the custom widget, its properties, and resource references (mandatory).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;sankeyChartStyling.js&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;An optional styling component used to expose styling options in the widget’s styling panel (optional).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;build/ folder&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Contains the helper script hash256.js, which is used to generate SHA-256 integrity keys for the JavaScript files.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note:&amp;nbsp;Styling files (Styling.js, sankeyChartStyling.js, or xxxxStyling.js) are optional and may not be required for all custom widgets.&lt;BR /&gt;However, the web component JavaScript file (main.js or equivalent) and the metadata file (index.json) are mandatory for every SAP Analytics Cloud custom widget.&amp;nbsp;The build folder is included purely for maintainability and ease of understanding.&lt;BR /&gt;Technically, the hash256.js file can also be placed directly in the main project folder. Including it in a separate subfolder is optional and does not impact deployment, as long as the final ZIP file complies with SAP Analytics Cloud’s upload requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Creating Integrity Keys and Deploying the Code&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Analytics Cloud supports SHA-256 integrity validation to ensure uploaded JavaScript resources are not modified.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Generating Integrity Keys&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Open a Node.js command prompt&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigate to the folder containing hash256.js&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Execute the script&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Example output:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;main.js: sha256-6134FFLCQYpH7x8gx29H1xJyRbitpf/guj5UGKhJ25Q=&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;sankeyChartStyling.js:&amp;nbsp; sha256-AR0uDO+9h8nu9EyJotSinZ2APDWD5Ja2JmdFcZCH1Xo=&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GovindaRaoBanothu45_1-1766473046724.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354869iD9B0D3FE54390042/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GovindaRaoBanothu45_1-1766473046724.png" alt="GovindaRaoBanothu45_1-1766473046724.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GovindaRaoBanothu45_3-1766473094599.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354871i0F8581EE857FE2A4/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GovindaRaoBanothu45_3-1766473094599.png" alt="GovindaRaoBanothu45_3-1766473094599.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note: If additional JavaScript resource files are included, their corresponding sha256- integrity keys must also be added to the index.json file under the resources section.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similarly, the file names must be updated in hash256.js before generating integrity keys for those files.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GovindaRaoBanothu45_4-1766473154728.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354872i4241C26FD2F3EA34/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GovindaRaoBanothu45_4-1766473154728.png" alt="GovindaRaoBanothu45_4-1766473154728.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Core Enhancement: Top-N Parent and Top-M Child Logic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following snippets are representative excerpts from the working implementation.&lt;BR /&gt;Full scripts are intentionally not published, as this widget was delivered as part of an enterprise engagement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the widget, the SAC data binding is first normalized into an array (data) containing parent node, child node, and measure value fields.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1: Aggregate Measure by Parent&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const parentTotals = {};

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As the year draws to a close and the holiday season is approaching, we’re excited to share one more set of updates before 2025 wraps up. The Q4 release of SAP HANA Cloud delivers a focused set of innovations designed to further improve operational efficiency, resilience, developer productivity, and more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="thumbq42025.png" style="width: 532px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/354730iC5716F44B7055295/image-dimensions/532x274?v=v2" width="532" height="274" role="button" title="thumbq42025.png" alt="thumbq42025.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s deep dive into key innovations included in the December 2025 release:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1638365449"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1441851944"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SQL Tools for Administration in SAP HANA Cloud Central&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1374421158"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Property Graph Viewer in Database Administration Tooling&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the Q4 release, SAP HANA Cloud Central introduces a property graph viewer directly within the database administration tooling. This viewer allows you to visually explore property graphs, where entities are represented as vertices and relationships as edges. A common example is modeling airports as vertices and flight routes as directed edges, including properties such as distance. You can apply filters to vertices and edges and enhance their analysis by applying built-in graph algorithms like neighborhood exploration, shortest path, or Cypher-based filtering.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Picture 1.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355128i1D1C4BE0BE0E35B5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture 1.png" alt="Picture 1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The main value of the property graph viewer is faster understanding of complex relationships stored in graph structures. Instead of relying on raw query results, you can visually explore how entities are connected and quickly identify patterns, dependencies, or anomalies. This makes graph data more accessible not only to technical experts but also to solution architects and analysts who benefit from an intuitive, visual representation of relationships.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1177907653"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SQL Console Background Activities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SQL console background activities enable long-running SQL statements to continue executing independently of the browser session. You can now start a statement, close the browser, and return later to review the results without interrupting execution. This capability is fully integrated into the database administration tooling in SAP HANA Cloud Central.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="backghr.png" style="width: 699px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355112iF6BCDD5E50FF1B45/image-dimensions/699x334?v=v2" width="699" height="334" role="button" title="backghr.png" alt="backghr.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This feature removes a long-standing friction point when working with complex or time-consuming SQL workloads. Administrators and developers no longer need to keep browser sessions open or worry about accidental disconnects. As a result, productivity increases, and operational tasks such as data preparation, analysis, or maintenance queries become more reliable and less disruptive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-981394148"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatic Saving and Loading of SQL Statements&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SQL console now automatically saves its contents and connection details and restores them when you return. This behavior can be configured in the settings, allowing you to decide how persistent their SQL console sessions should be.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="thomashammer_0-1766481067179.png" style="width: 547px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355082i2F49709DBC0F936A/image-dimensions/547x253?v=v2" width="547" height="253" role="button" title="thomashammer_0-1766481067179.png" alt="thomashammer_0-1766481067179.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This enhancement provides continuity when switching tasks or sessions. You can pick up exactly where you left off, without re-establishing connections or recovering lost SQL statements. It improves day-to-day efficiency and reduces context switching, especially for administrators and developers working across multiple systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-784880643"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application for Schemas and Deployment Infrastructure Containers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;A new application in the database administration tooling provides a consolidated view of schemas and SAP HANA deployment infrastructure (HDI) containers within a subaccount. These can optionally be grouped by their associated SAP HANA database instance. You can examine detailed metadata, including Cloud Foundry organization and space information, instance IDs, and links to the associated database. From there, you can directly navigate to the database instance or open a SQL Console or database explorer connection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This application simplifies landscape transparency for administrators. Instead of piecing together information across tools, you can quickly identify where schemas and containers live, understand their context, and jump directly into analysis or troubleshooting. This is especially valuable in larger environments with many applications and database instances.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="thomashammer_1-1766481113280.png" style="width: 576px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355084i83AFC32E03CB90F6/image-dimensions/576x272?v=v2" width="576" height="272" role="button" title="thomashammer_1-1766481113280.png" alt="thomashammer_1-1766481113280.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-459284419"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-262770914"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-Model and Machine Learning Updates&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the Q4 2025 release of SAP HANA Cloud, we continue to strengthen embedded Machine Learning and AI capabilities across the Predictive Analysis Library (PAL), the Automated Predictive Library (APL), and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Services. These enhancements focus on making advanced analytics easier to use, more consistent across scenarios, and better suited for real-world business data.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key highlights of this release are:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A new unified time series procedure, serving developers to utilize the same interface across different times series algorithms&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;text embedding model enhancements, supporting output vector dimensionality reduction, while maintaining retrieval accuracy&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;a new cross encoder model with the NLP services, for accurately re-ranking search results&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;text column input, text embedding operators with AutoML classification and regression models&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;text tokenization enhancements supporting regular expression token filtering and a new text log parsing function for detecting and determining new log pattern&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;the HANA ML experiment monitor UI now supports visual model monitoring and drift analysis&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To learn more about the new Multi-Model and Machine Learning updates, check out &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/14106"&gt;@ChristophMorgen&lt;/a&gt;‘s blogpost &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/new-machine-learning-nlp-and-ai-features-in-sap-hana-cloud-2025-q4/ba-p/14293152" target="_blank"&gt;here.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-195340128"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transforming Property Graphs into Knowledge Graphs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the Q4 2025 release, SAP HANA Cloud introduces the ability to transform property graphs into knowledge graphs. This capability allows you to convert existing graph structures into a semantic, knowledge-graph representation without redesigning your data models from scratch. It enables you to work with different graph paradigms on top of the same underlying data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This innovation helps you maximize data utility by seamlessly switching between property graph and knowledge graph models depending on your needs. You are no longer restricted to a single data representation and can choose the most appropriate graph model for analytics, reasoning, or integration scenarios. As a result, you gain greater operational efficiency, improved interoperability between graph models, and more flexibility in how you explore and reuse graph-based data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Learn more about transforming property graphs into knowledge graphs on &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/converting-property-graphs-to-knowledge-graphs-in-sap-hana-cloud-a-simple/ba-p/14294883" target="_blank"&gt;this blogpost&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; by &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/38259"&gt;@shabana&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/38259" target="_blank"&gt;.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--130256096"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-442970482"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Calculation View Modeling Updates&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--46946030"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Column Lineage Insights for Graphical Calculation Views&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP HANA Cloud now allows you to gain column lineage insights for graphically modeled calculation views by calling an SQL table function. This capability provides transparency into how output columns are derived from underlying sources, with lineage tracked across graphical modeling steps and stopping at functions or procedures.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By making lineage information easily accessible, this feature improves model quality and trust. Developers can better understand complex models, speed up enhancements, and reduce errors during refactoring. For architects and analysts, clearer lineage increases confidence in the data and supports governance and audit requirements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--243459535"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Input Parameters for Currency and Unit Conversion in MDS Cubes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Input parameters can now be used to specify client values for currency and unit conversion when working with multidimensional services (MDS) cubes. These values no longer need to be materialized, and conversions can be defined dynamically at query runtime.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This enhancement increases flexibility in analytical scenarios. You can adapt conversions based on runtime context without redesigning models or creating additional persisted data. It enables more dynamic reporting and simplifies scenarios where conversion logic depends on user input or business context.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--439973040"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Restricted Columns in MDS Cubes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With Q4, restricted columns can be added to MDS cubes and evaluated at query execution time. If runtime evaluation is not possible, deployment fails with a clear notification. This approach avoids mandatory materialization of input parameters while still ensuring correctness.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The key value lies in greater runtime control and reduced data preparation overhead. You can now influence how restricted columns are processed without forcing early decisions during modeling, leading to more flexible cubes and more efficient execution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--636486545"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Visibility of Key Columns When Modeling Joins&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When defining joins in calculation views, key columns are now visually indicated. This makes it easier to understand join semantics and identify important relationships directly in the modeling UI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By highlighting key columns, this feature helps you create star joins with greater confidence and accuracy. It reduces modeling errors, improves data consistency, and ultimately results in higher-quality analytical models.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--833000050"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Left Outer Joins in Star Joins of MDS Cubes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP HANA Cloud now supports left outer joins in star joins for MDS cubes. This expands the range of scenarios that can be modeled using multidimensional services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The benefit is faster adoption of MDS cubes in additional analytical use cases. You gain more flexibility in how dimensions and facts are combined, without having to fall back to alternative modeling approaches.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are interested in discovering more about Calculation View modeling updates, check out &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/calculation-view-features-of-2025-qrc4/ba-p/14284865" target="_blank"&gt;this blogpost&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; by @&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/239612" target="_blank"&gt;JanZwickel.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--736110548"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--932624053"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Reliability and Total Cost of Ownership&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Q4 release of SAP HANA Cloud is also introducing significant enhancements to strengthen the service's reliability while reduction the overal total cost of ownership at the same time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1422540565"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-Region Disaster Recovery&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In early Q4 we extended disaster recovery capabilities beyond multiple availability zones within a single region to selected, distant regions. The initial scope focused on North America, using Amazon Web Services with a pairing between US East (VA) and US West (Oregon). Support includes SAP HANA Cloud Data Lake Files, while multi-tenancy is excluded in the initial phase.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This innovation significantly improves resilience against regional outages. By maintaining a secondary system in a distant region, customers can better protect critical workloads and ensure business continuity. The offering starts with a defined scope and will expand stepwise to additional regions, cloud providers, and features.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;P&gt;We're happy to share, that we will be extending our offering to Europe, early in January 2026. Customers will then be able to protect SAP HANA Cloud workloads across EU Central (Frankfurt) and EU South (Milan), improving resilience against regional outages with a secondary system in a predefined, geographically distant region. This expansion will help EU-based and global customers strengthen business continuity while meeting regional availability and data residency needs, with additional regions and enhancements planned based on demand.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="metrodr.png" style="width: 349px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355114i8DEB72E39F104DCD/image-dimensions/349x207?v=v2" width="349" height="207" role="button" title="metrodr.png" alt="metrodr.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Active/Active Read-Enabled High Availability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;Synchronous replicas in a "high availability" configuration ensure increased reliability via autonomous failover capabilities to standby systems, in case of outages or other incidents.&lt;BR /&gt;But, such high availability setups require redundant resources, which traditionally remain idle during normal operations. With the new active/active read-enabled option, SAP HANA Cloud allows these secondary systems to actively handle read-intensive analytical workloads. In the initial scope, client-side statement routing enables applications to direct analytical queries to these replicas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="active.png" style="width: 414px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355117i1E383A134E6BADC7/image-dimensions/414x304?v=v2" width="414" height="304" role="button" title="active.png" alt="active.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach improves cost efficiency and performance at the same time. You can offload analytical workloads from the primary system while still preserving full high-availability readiness. The same resources that ensure resilience now also deliver day-to-day business value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1619054070"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automatic Up-Scaling Storage&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP HANA Cloud now supports automatic storage upscaling to prevent disk-full situations. When enabled by administrators, the system can double the initially provisioned storage size - up to a customer-defined maximum - once usage reaches 98%. Alerts notify administrators, and a minimum cycle time of six hours applies between scaling events.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This capability helps avoid critical outages caused by full disks while still keeping costs under control. Administrators gain more time to react to growing storage needs and can define clear boundaries for automatic scaling, balancing safety and predictability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1353980877"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1550494382"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Seamless Integration with&amp;nbsp; SAP Business Data Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;As &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/what-s-next-with-sap-hana-cloud-sap-teched-2025/ba-p/14258163" target="_blank"&gt;announced at SAP TechEd 2025&lt;/A&gt;, SAP HANA Cloud will integrate in a bi-directional manner with SAP Business Data Cloud, to consume and produce data products and thereby combine the best out of two solutions. While the production of data products will become available in early 2026, the consumption is now possible with our latest release.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--2040410894"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Native Consumption of Data Products&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP HANA Cloud can now directly consume data products from SAP Business Data Cloud. Virtual table connections are created automatically, enabling seamless access from SAP HANA Cloud to the data product source.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This integration allows customers to extend SAP line-of-business applications with custom logic while relying on governed, reusable data products. It reduces integration effort and accelerates innovation by making enterprise data easier to access and combine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1943521392"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="data products.png" style="width: 731px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355118i194F372AC38FE6CC/image-dimensions/731x317?v=v2" width="731" height="317" role="button" title="data products.png" alt="data products.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--2140034897"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1958418894"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhancements to SQL on Files&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1468502382"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Delta Table Replication&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Direct read-only access to Delta tables in&amp;nbsp;the object&amp;nbsp;storage or through Delta Sharing, which has been introduced since QRC&amp;nbsp;04/2024, has offered real-time analytics on the vast volume of data in files, without moving them into SAP HANA Cloud.&amp;nbsp;With QRC 04/2025, it evolves further by offering replication capability for critical datasets, enabling faster queries with greater flexibility and robust data management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This new Delta&amp;nbsp;table-to-HANA replication offers granular controls, such as chunk-based&amp;nbsp;initial&amp;nbsp;load, which allows splitting the data into multiple chunks and loading them separately to make the&amp;nbsp;initial&amp;nbsp;load more manageable. Furthermore, when it comes to Change Data Capture (CDC), it allows either user-driven, version-based CDC or system-driven, scheduled CDC for full automation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To learn more about SAP HANA Cloud’s&amp;nbsp;new Delta table-to-HANA replication,&amp;nbsp;take a look at &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/204092"&gt;@SeungjoonLee&lt;/a&gt;'s blog post&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/accelerating-your-analytics-with-delta-table-replication-into-sap-hana/ba-p/14290281" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;here&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Smart Data Access:&amp;nbsp;Support&amp;nbsp;for two new remote&amp;nbsp;sources through Data Access Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Additionally, based on the newly introduced Smart Data Access (SDA) Data Access Agent from the last QRC&amp;nbsp;03/2025, read-only access to two new remote sources, Google Sheets and Oracle Database in the cloud, will be available from QRC&amp;nbsp;04/2025.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The way of configuring and using them&amp;nbsp;remains&amp;nbsp;the same&amp;nbsp;as for&amp;nbsp;other previously supported remote sources, and for newly provisioned Data Access Agents, all new adapters are activated by default.

See&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73554900100800002881&amp;amp;range=CURRENT-LAST&amp;amp;q=data%20center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Roadmap Explorer&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;for details.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We continue our journey to give customers the freedom to choose their preferred infrastructure cloud provider by investing in regions on both&amp;nbsp;hyperscalers&amp;nbsp;and SAP Cloud Infrastructure (SCI).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;On AWS, we are announcing the availability of SAP HANA Cloud in a second European region: Italy (Milan). This&amp;nbsp;establishes&amp;nbsp;the technical foundation for multi-region disaster recovery within European borders.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first SCI region — Germany (Frankfurt) — was announced in Q3 2025, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-sap-hana-cloud-on-sap-cloud-infrastructure/ba-p/14223782" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt;&lt;U&gt;.&lt;/U&gt; Now, we are making SAP HANA Cloud available globally on SCI, by offering a second SCI region in Germany (with EU Access), as well as SCI regions in the U.S., Australia, and the UAE.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1172364874"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1144035060"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Further Updates&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-654118548"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Native Multi-Tenancy: Tenant Move with Reduced Downtime&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The enhanced tenant move process for SAP HANA Cloud native multi-tenancy splits the operation into a preparation phase and a short cutover phase. During preparation, tenant data is copied while the source tenant remains fully operational. Only during the final cutover is brief downtime required to apply delta changes and switch over.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This significantly reduces business downtime and gives you control over scheduling the cutover in low-impact time windows. It improves operational flexibility and minimizes risk during tenant reorganization.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-457605043"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Selective, Incremental Migration to SAP HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Selective, incremental migration allows you to migrate chosen parts of an SAP HANA 2.0 database to SAP HANA Cloud instead of moving everything at once. Migrations can be performed in smaller, manageable steps based on schemas or deployment infrastructure containers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="migrationpatterns.png" style="width: 492px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355125i42F1B3310D03273A/image-dimensions/492x276?v=v2" width="492" height="276" role="button" title="migrationpatterns.png" alt="migrationpatterns.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach reduces downtime, avoids migrating unused components, and makes large migrations more predictable. It allows you to better plan the transition to the cloud, while minimizing disruption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-261091538"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rule-Based Index Advisor&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new rule-based Index Advisor analyzes query usage patterns to identify index optimization opportunities. It recommends creating or dropping indexes for single-table filter queries and provides ready-to-execute SQL statements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By automating index analysis, this feature improves performance while helping control costs. Administrators gain actionable insights without deep manual analysis, making database tuning more accessible and efficient.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thanks for taking the time to explore the What’s New in SAP HANA Cloud on Q4 2025 innovations!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you’d like to go deeper into the technical details of the December 2025 release, we recommend visiting the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/whats-new/2495b34492334456a49084831c2bea4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What’s New Viewer&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; in the technical documentation.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1767475851"&gt;How to turn AI ambition into real traction — with the right methodology&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Artificial intelligence is firmly embedded in enterprise strategies today.&lt;BR /&gt;What many organizations still struggle with, however, is turning AI ambition into &lt;STRONG&gt;operational value&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Too many initiatives stall at proof-of-concept stage, create isolated solutions, or deliver impressive demos without enabling real business decisions. Over time, this erodes trust — in technology, in delivery models, and sometimes even in IT leadership.&lt;BR /&gt;The key question is therefore no longer &lt;EM&gt;“What could we do with AI?”&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How do we move from a real business problem to a confident go / no-go decision — quickly, responsibly, and with the organization on board?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570962346"&gt;Why this matters now&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI is no longer an innovation topic. It is a &lt;STRONG&gt;leadership and transformation topic&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, AI initiatives compete with limited organizational change capacity, ongoing cloud transformations, rising expectations from business leaders, and increasing pressure to deliver visible results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The real risk is not moving too slowly.&lt;BR /&gt;It is moving fast in the wrong direction — creating fragmented solutions, undermining trust, or introducing AI faster than the organization can absorb it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What companies need now is not more experimentation, but a &lt;STRONG&gt;repeatable way to turn AI ideas into informed decisions&lt;/STRONG&gt;, aligned with enterprise standards and grounded in real business needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1374448841"&gt;Problem first — not technology first&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Successful AI use cases do not start with models, tools, or platforms.&lt;BR /&gt;They start with &lt;STRONG&gt;concrete business pain points&lt;/STRONG&gt;: high manual effort, lack of transparency, time pressure in critical phases, or uncertainty in decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is exactly where proven innovation approaches such as the &lt;A title="SAP AppHaus" href="https://apphaus.sap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AppHaus&lt;/A&gt; come in. The focus is on understanding and framing the problem first, prioritizing what really matters — and only then discussing solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This shift sounds simple, but it fundamentally changes outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Humanize, visualize and validate with Scenes from SAP AppHaus" style="width: 621px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355167i7C4E13BA85D67623/image-dimensions/621x221?v=v2" width="621" height="221" role="button" title="image.png" alt="Humanize, visualize and validate with Scenes from SAP AppHaus" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Humanize, visualize and validate with Scenes from SAP AppHaus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1177935336"&gt;From idea to decision: rapid prototyping with SAP Mode 2 Garage&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The examples below were implemented using the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Mode 2 Garage&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A Mode 2 Garage is a highly focused, time-boxed format in which customers work together with SAP to analyze a concrete business problem, define clear goals and success criteria, build a working prototype, and create a solid decision basis for next steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Methodologically, the Mode 2 Garage combines AppHaus principles — problem focus, user centricity, co-innovation — with hands-on implementation together with SAP Services, the customer, and end users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The outcome is not a concept.&lt;BR /&gt;It is &lt;STRONG&gt;clarity&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-981421831"&gt;Two example use cases from practice&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-784908326"&gt;Use case 1: AI-supported user guidance in procurement&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-right" image-alt="293585_GettyImages-1382268246_x_small_jpg.jpg" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355218i40D17F462753EF54/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="293585_GettyImages-1382268246_x_small_jpg.jpg" alt="293585_GettyImages-1382268246_x_small_jpg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In large organizations, many procurement needs arise outside the daily routine — often from people who do not regularly work with procurement processes. These needs are not necessarily complex, but they are unfamiliar.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Typical situations include one-time service requests, non-catalog purchases, questions around existing framework agreements, or time-critical requests with limited process knowledge.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a result, procurement teams face high manual effort, inconsistent data quality, and avoidable delays — not because functionality is missing, but because &lt;STRONG&gt;guidance is missing at the moment of need&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-717477540"&gt;Implementation approach (high level)&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The prototype was built around a chat-based user interface on the &lt;A title="SAP Business Technology Platform" href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform&lt;/A&gt;, serving as a central entry point for users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A custom chatbot captured requests in natural language. Uploaded quotations and documents were analyzed and grounded with enterprise context using the SAP GenAI Hub. Instead of generating generic answers, AI responses were enriched with structured enterprise knowledge. Relevant SAP backend systems were integrated to retrieve information such as applicable framework agreements, category-specific rules, approval thresholds, and historical purchasing patterns.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Critical decision points remained explicitly &lt;STRONG&gt;human-in-the-loop&lt;/STRONG&gt;. AI was positioned as guidance and decision support — not automation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The solution was implemented modularly, extensible, and aligned with standard processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-520964035"&gt;Outcome and time-to-value&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even at prototype stage, the solution delivered tangible value: fewer follow-up questions to procurement, improved data quality at the point of request, and higher user acceptance through guided interaction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on clear decision readiness, the solution was further developed and &lt;STRONG&gt;went live in less than one year&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;The prototype did not just validate an idea — it became the springboard into productive use.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-324450530"&gt;Outlook&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking ahead, this approach is well suited to be integrated into SAP Joule as a &lt;STRONG&gt;custom-built Joule skill&lt;/STRONG&gt;, embedding AI-supported procurement guidance directly into daily workflows while retaining full control over enterprise context, governance, and process logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1145694"&gt;Use case 2: AI-supported GR/IR reconciliation in finance closing&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-right" image-alt="287384_GettyImages-138030903_x_small_jpg.jpg" style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355217i048977149DDB2679/image-size/small?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="287384_GettyImages-138030903_x_small_jpg.jpg" alt="287384_GettyImages-138030903_x_small_jpg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Although the company was already running on SAP S/4HANA, GR/IR reconciliation was still largely handled in the traditional SAP GUI way. Transparency on open cases was limited, analysis effort was high, and closing periods were stressful for finance and procurement alike.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The challenge was not missing functionality, but handling complexity &lt;STRONG&gt;efficiently and consistently&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--143807849"&gt;Step 1: Standard first&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first deliberate step was not AI, but the introduction of the standard GR/IR &lt;A title="Monitoring" href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F3303')/S31PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Monitoring&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A title="Reconciliation" href="https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/#/detail/Apps('F3302')/S31PCE" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Reconciliation&lt;/A&gt; Fiori app. This alone improved transparency, established a shared working basis, and clarified ownership across teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--340321354"&gt;Step 2: Targeted AI extension&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Building on the standard, a complementary custom Fiori app was prototyped to address the hard cases: unmatched GR/IR positions, unclear root causes, and high manual clarification effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP standard remained the system of record. AI was applied selectively where complexity arose. Document AI analyzed invoices and supporting documents, while generative AI summarized context and suggested next best actions. Importantly, AI did not post accounting entries — it supported expert decision-making by structuring information and proposing options.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--536834859"&gt;Positioning towards the SAP standard&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Comparable capabilities will increasingly become available through embedded AI capabilities and SAP Joule as part of SAP’s roadmap. In this case, however, Joule was not yet an option due to missing cloud readiness in the current system landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The prototype therefore deliberately served as a &lt;STRONG&gt;bridge to the standard&lt;/STRONG&gt; — delivering short-term value, enabling organizational learning, and preparing for future adoption of standard SAP capabilities, without creating a long-term parallel solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--733348364"&gt;Current status&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Around six months after the prototype, the use case is in business testing and validation, with a strong focus on trust, plausibility, and acceptance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--636458862"&gt;The biggest challenge is not AI — it's change&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Across both use cases, one insight stood out clearly: the biggest hurdle is not technology, data, or architecture — it is&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;change management&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For readers who want to dive deeper into AI concepts such as grounding, document AI, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), SAP provides a comprehensive reference with its &lt;A title="AI Best Practices on SAP BTP" href="https://btp-ai-bp.docs.sap/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI Best Practices on SAP BTP&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In practice, however, success depended less on technology and more on how people adapted. Introducing AI changes how users trust recommendations, interact with systems, make decisions, and let go of familiar routines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rapid prototyping played a crucial role by creating a &lt;STRONG&gt;safe learning environment&lt;/STRONG&gt; — allowing teams to build confidence before scaling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--832972367"&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI initiatives need a &lt;STRONG&gt;decision goal&lt;/STRONG&gt;, not just a technical objective&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard-first approaches build trust and accelerate adoption&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prototypes create value when they enable organizational learning&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Change management must start on day one&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI succeeds when people become comfortable using it&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1029485872"&gt;Conclusion: methodology beats actionism&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI does not fail because of technology.&lt;BR /&gt;It fails when organizations move faster than their people.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Clear methodology, rapid prototyping, and early change management are what turn AI from strategic intent into operational value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1225999377"&gt;Want to try this approach yourself?&lt;BR /&gt;Join our upcoming customer hackathon&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="image.png" style="width: 600px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355175i8391D6072D2402E3/image-dimensions/600x158?v=v2" width="600" height="158" role="button" title="image.png" alt="image.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For customers who want to explore AI pragmatically and advance concrete use cases, we are organizing&amp;nbsp; customer hackathons.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The format follows the same core principles as the SAP Mode 2 Garage: real business problems, cross-functional teams, rapid prototyping, and a strong focus on decision readiness rather than demo perfection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The hackathons will take place in &lt;STRONG&gt;Berlin, Munich, Vienna, and Zurich&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Interested?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Learn more about the hackathons and register here: &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A title="Hackathon – Business meets AI" href="https://events.sap.com/ch-hackathon-march26/en_us/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Hackathon – Business meets AI&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you would like to discuss the methodologies, formats, and tools described in this article feel free to reach out directly via &lt;A title="email" href="mailto:christian.messerli@sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;email&lt;/A&gt; or &lt;A title="LinkedIn" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-messerli-a0879b19a/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello Hello,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1767513426"&gt;Introduction:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I would like to share my hands-on experience using SAP Integration Advisor &amp;nbsp;based on independent exploration and practical experimentation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The primary focus will be on&amp;nbsp;Message Implementation Guidelines (MIG) and Mapping Guidelines (MAG).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I will also briefly touch on the technology platform context, specifically SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), with the scope strictly limited to integration-related services. Topics such as analytics, artificial intelligence, automation, and application development are intentionally out of scope for this blog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At the end of the blog, I will include a set of reference materials that supported my learning journey. That said, the majority of the insights and conclusions shared here are derived from direct, hands-on experience rather than theoretical examples.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1570999921"&gt;Technology Platform:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, let’s start with the Technology Platform. What does that really mean?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A &lt;STRONG&gt;t&lt;/STRONG&gt;echnology platform is the basic foundation that allows software to run. It is made up of different layers that work together, including infrastructure (hardware, memory, storage, databases), the operating system (Windows, Linux), runtime environments, security and networking, and the software layer itself — such as databases, web applications, mobile apps, and IoT solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In simple terms, a technology platform provides everything needed to build, run, and secure applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rhviana_1-1766855866233.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/356262i91A11184B2659B84/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1766855866233.png" alt="rhviana_1-1766855866233.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1374486416"&gt;SAP BTP (SAP Business Technology Platform)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) is SAP’s cloud-based platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that enables organizations to extend, integrate, and innovate across SAP and non-SAP systems in a secure and upgrade-safe way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As mentioned earlier, the image below highlights the four technology pillars supported by SAP BTP. That said, in this blog we will focus only on the integration pillar, specifically SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="rhviana_3-1766856531191.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/356263i873660CCE8FBD73A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rhviana_3-1766856531191.png" alt="rhviana_3-1766856531191.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1177972911"&gt;What is SAP Integration Suite?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Suite is SAP’s cloud-based integration platform used to connect SAP and non-SAP systems, both in the cloud and on-premise, in a secure, scalable, and standardized way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Core component for end-to-end integrations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration Advisor&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; – Used mainly for B2B and EDI scenarios&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Expose, secure, and manage APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Open Connectors&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Prebuilt connectors for third-party applications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Event Mesh&lt;/STRONG&gt; - The event-driven backbone&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;OK, we’ve already talked about the technology platform, explored SAP BTP, explored the cloud types of service and walked through SAP Integration Suite and its components.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now comes the most important part of this blog — Integration Advisor. So let’s dive in and start this journey together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-981459406"&gt;What is SAP Integration Advisor?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Advisor is a capability within SAP Integration Suite, primarily designed for B2B and EDI-based integrations, supporting both inbound and outbound scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Its main purpose is to help organizations design, standardize, and govern message structures and mappings in a reusable, scalable, and partner-independent manner, enabling consistent and efficient integration across multiple business partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of building point-to-point mappings directly in iFlows in SAP Cloud Platform Integration, Integration Advisor introduces a model-driven approach based on:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIG (Message Implementation Guideline)&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Defines message type content, select field by field from the message type.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MAG (Message Mapping Guideline)&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Defines mapping logic of fields.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TPM (Trading Partner Management)&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Assigns partners and agreements at runtime&lt;BR /&gt;Since this is an exploratory blog, &lt;STRONG&gt;we will not go into TPM in depth and will focus only on its definition.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-914028620"&gt;Roles and Responsibilities: MIG vs. MAG from a SAP CPI Developer Perspective:&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;One important point to highlight is that a &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI developer &lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;should generally not be responsible for creating MIGs (Message Implementation Guidelines)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;MIGs define the canonical data structure, including business fields, their semantic meaning, validation rules, and compliance with EDI standards. Creating a MIG requires deep business process knowledge and EDI expertise, typically provided by business analysts, functional consultants, or EDI specialists rather than technical integration developers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From a SAP CPI developer’s point of view, &lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;it is &lt;EM&gt;technically possible&lt;/EM&gt; to work with MIGs&lt;/FONT&gt; only if there is very clear and well-defined mapping documentation between the EDI standard and the SAP business objects. Without strong functional input, the risk of semantic errors is high—even if the technical mapping itself is correct.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;MAGs (Mapping Guidelines), on the other hand, are where the actual field-to-field mapping logic is implemented. This activity is comparable to traditional message mapping tasks already familiar to SAP CPI developers. It involves transforming source structures into target structures based on predefined rules, conditions, and conversions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Mapping Guidelines (MAGs) are designed to support standardized, declarative mappings and therefore do not support complex transformation logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;MAGs are implemented using XSLT, which is well-suited for:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Straightforward field-to-field mappings&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Simple value mappings and lookups&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Basic conditional logic&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Structural transformations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, MAGs are not intended for complex business logic, such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Advanced conditional flows&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Context XML node control&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Loop Structures&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Stateful processing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cross-message correlations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Custom algorithms or calculations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Dynamic, runtime-driven transformations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is precisely where a &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP CPI developer should be actively involved&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as MAGs require strong technical integration skills, knowledge of SAP data models, and experience with transformation logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-588432396"&gt;SAP Processes vs. EDI Standards — A Practical Overview&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP B2B integration scenarios, the same business process can be represented by different EDI standards, depending on factors such as industry, geographical region, and trading partner requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, a single SAP business process (such as Order-to-Cash or Procure-to-Pay) may be exchanged using different EDI formats across partners. This variability increases complexity and requires a structured approach to mapping and governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below is a simplified overview that illustrates how SAP business processes can be mapped to multiple EDI message formats.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-391918891"&gt;Business Context: Inbound EDI Integration into SAP&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To simplify the explanation, I designed a &lt;STRONG&gt;single high-level diagram&lt;/STRONG&gt; that illustrates the end-to-end inbound EDI flow, instead of presenting multiple step-by-step screenshots and low-level technical details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-324488105"&gt;Integration Advisor Design Approach&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP Integration Advisor (IA), the process starts with the definition of Message Implementation Guidelines (MIGs).&lt;BR /&gt;For an inbound integration scenario, two MIGs are required:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Outbound MIG (from the external partner perspective)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Inbound MIG ( to the SAP system perspective)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-127974600"&gt;Use Case Description:&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this proof-of-concept, I am working with the &lt;STRONG&gt;EDI X12 message type 850 (Purchase Order)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, version &lt;STRONG&gt;004010&lt;/STRONG&gt;, including the envelope structure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For this purpose, I created the following MIG for the external system:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MIG.ORDERPROCESS.X12.850.OUT&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the SAP inbound side, the target system is &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise&lt;/STRONG&gt;, using the &lt;STRONG&gt;IDoc message type ORDERS05&lt;/STRONG&gt;

receives the following business requirement directly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In practice, architectural and functional responsibilities are shifted to the technical layer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The image below illustrates this scenario, in which SAP CPI was responsible for the entire end-to-end integration, without guidance or governance from SAP Integration Advisor, and still managed to successfully build the iFlow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rhviana_1-1766861742861.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/356269i21A2E22912EC7842/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rhviana_1-1766861742861.png" alt="rhviana_1-1766861742861.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The difference between using a MAG (Mapping Guideline) and building a manual Message Mapping is significant and far more complex, as illustrated in the image below.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rhviana_2-1766862266231.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/356270iC3A111C400D06C74/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="rhviana_2-1766862266231.png" alt="rhviana_2-1766862266231.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--636421287"&gt;Conclusion from SAP CPI Developer Explorer:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is important to clarify that this governance—including the definition of MIGs, MAGs, and especially TPM—is not the primary responsibility of an SAP CPI developer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Integration Advisor is a powerful tool for standardizing EDI, its success depends on solid architectural governance involving both Business and Architects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Viana.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Blogs about the topic:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/integration-advisor-overview-of-components-for-building-b2b-integration/ba-p/13512772" target="_blank"&gt;Integration Advisor: Overview of components for building B2B integration content and further reading&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/beginner-s-guide-to-integration-advisor/ba-p/13629944" target="_self"&gt;Beginner's Guide to Integration Advisor&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/integration-advisor-key-concepts-of-a-message-implementation-guideline/ba-p/13412487" target="_self"&gt;Integration Advisor - Key concepts of a Message Implementation Guideline&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/integration-content-advisor-create-a-customized-interface-using-mig-editor/ba-p/13354699" target="_self"&gt;integration content advisor: Create a customized interface using MIG editor&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1767482852"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP CPI Message Mapping, I faced a &lt;STRONG&gt;OneAsMany violation&lt;/STRONG&gt; due to mismatched occurrences between two source fields:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Company Code&lt;/STRONG&gt; → Occurrence = 1&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;PRODUCTTAXITEM&lt;/STRONG&gt; → Occurrence = 2&lt;BR /&gt;So basically, due to difference in context change, I was not able to use it in value mapping where the target field occurrence is also 2 times, due to this if i use it without OneasMany, it is throwing error : target field require value for it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This resulted in the following OneAsMany rules being violated:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rule 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Input 1 should not contain repeating values in the same context.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business requirement was to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Increase the &lt;STRONG&gt;context of Company Code&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Match it with the number of &lt;STRONG&gt;PRODUCTTAXITEM&lt;/STRONG&gt; occurrences&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Repeat &lt;STRONG&gt;only the first Company Code value&lt;/STRONG&gt; for all PRODUCTTAXITEM contexts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Groovy code used is as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;import com.sap.it.api.mapping.*&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;// Function name must match the name used in Message Mapping UI&lt;BR /&gt;def void replicateCompanyCode(&lt;BR /&gt;String[] companyCode,&lt;BR /&gt;String[] productTaxItem,&lt;BR /&gt;Output companyCodeOut,&lt;BR /&gt;MappingContext context) {&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;// Guard checks&lt;BR /&gt;if (companyCode == null || companyCode.length == 0 ||&lt;BR /&gt;productTaxItem == null || productTaxItem.length == 0) {&lt;BR /&gt;companyCodeOut.addSuppress()&lt;BR /&gt;return&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;// Take only the first Company Code&lt;BR /&gt;String firstCompanyCode = companyCode[0]&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;// Create context based on PRODUCTTAXITEM count&lt;BR /&gt;for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; productTaxItem.length; i++) {&lt;BR /&gt;companyCodeOut.addValue(firstCompanyCode)&lt;BR /&gt;companyCodeOut.addContextChange()&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Unit test :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="contextincrease.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/355478i94D431DF3926F4FE/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="contextincrease.png" alt="contextincrease.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="ember1409" id="toc-hId-1767543240"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP Joule is SAP’s AI copilot that helps users perform business tasks using natural language. A Joule skill is a defined capability that allows Joule to answer questions or trigger actions in SAP systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sap joule.jpg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/356755iD58AA0406600B7C0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="sap joule.jpg" alt="sap joule.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP Joule is not natively built for direct integration with SAP ECC (Enterprise Core Component). It is primarily designed as a cloud native AI copilot for SAP's cloud solutions, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP SuccessFactors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;However, customers on ECC can still leverage some of Joule's capabilities through hybrid approaches using the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP).&amp;nbsp; This blog explains how to design and create a Joule skill that works with SAP ECC, using SAP’s recommended tools and architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember1413" id="toc-hId-1571029735"&gt;Step 1: Understand What a Joule Skill Is&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;A Joule skill consists of:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A user intent (what the user asks Joule)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Business logic (what happens behind the scenes)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;System integration (ECC in this case)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A structured response back to the user&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;“Joule, show me the open sales orders for top problematic customer ABC.”&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="ember1418" id="toc-hId-1374516230"&gt;Step 2: Identify the Use Case in SAP ECC&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Start with a simple, high value use case.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Good examples&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Check sales order status of top 5 customers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Customer 360 degree snapshots&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Display open invoices&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get material stock levels&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Which orders are delayed today?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Which materials are at risk this week?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;What is product costing for X product in last 5 years?

と設定します。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;idp.metadata_url&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CLSが IAS から SAML メタデータを取得するための URL です。IAS テナントのエンドポイントに /saml2/metadata を付与して指定します。例えば、IAS テナントが &lt;A target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;'https://&amp;lt;YOUR-TENANT-NAME&amp;gt;.accounts400.ondemand.com&lt;/A&gt;'の場合、'&lt;A target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://&amp;lt;YOUR-TENANT-NAME&amp;gt;.accounts400.ondemand.com/saml2/metadata'&lt;/A&gt;を設定します。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;idp.entity_id&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;上記 metadata_url をブラウザで開き、XML の先頭に記載されている entityID の値を設定します。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;sp.entity_id&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Service Provider としての CLS を識別する ID で、今回は 'CLS-Demo' を使用します。IAS 側の SAML 設定において、同じ値を登録する必要があります。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-391973691"&gt;手順3 : IAS 側の SAML 設定&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;IAS のアプリケーション設定画面で Configure Manually を選択し、SAML 設定を行います。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span
