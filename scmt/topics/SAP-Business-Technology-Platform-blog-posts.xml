    <content>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We are excited to announce that &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://url.sap/6djk9r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;SAP Discovery Center&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; has expanded to include even more SAP Business Technology Platform expert insights and strategic guidance. The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/guidance-framework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;SAP BTP Guidance Framework&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; has now found a new home in SAP Discovery Center.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;You have consistently praised SAP Discovery Center for being an excellent resource for all things SAP BTP. Including, BTP Service and AI Feature catalog info, cost estimations, and implementation guidance. Your feedback always remains the same – “It’s so nice to find all the info in one place.”. With your feedback in mind, we are excited to bring these two key resources closer together in one location.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What does this mean for you?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;You might remember the previous SAP Discovery Center homepage, which welcomed you with four main tiles – Missions, Reference Architectures, SAP BTP Services, and SAP Business AI. What you will notice now is that the Reference Architectures tile has been replaced by a brand-new tile – SAP BTP Guidance Framework.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="1_DC_homepage.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295848i9D95431791D5F533/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="1_DC_homepage.png" alt="1_DC_homepage.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Don’t worry, you can still easily find all reference architectures on the new SAP BTP Guidance Framework landing page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2_DC_BTP GF_page.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295849i77C65D3CDC206CE6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2_DC_BTP GF_page.png" alt="2_DC_BTP GF_page.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;If you are new to the SAP BTP Guidance Framework, it provides clear direction and a structured approach to adopting SAP technologies.

    <title>SAP BTP - An Executive Introduction</title>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1235"&gt;@timoelliott&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an innovation evangelist with SAP.&amp;nbsp; In this executive overview of&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform,&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Timo introduces the value of SAP BTP, its solutions, differentiators, key customer references and where to learn more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;You can watch the &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/embed/public/vp/a/fJaa1zM?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1224760&amp;amp;includeSapBrandedWraper=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;original video here&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-04 100202.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296196i65C6CC72B15F9B95/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-04 100202.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-04 100202.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You may have noticed there's a lot of chaos in the modern world. Change seems to be changing faster, from pandemics that turn the world upside down to big, unexpected tariff changes that disrupt the world's supply chains overnight. And since everything relies on technology these days, reacting quickly to market changes means changing your computer systems. And that's not always as easy as it should be.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'm sure you've seen this quote before: "Since the dawn of time, the key to survival has always been the ability to change." And yet, more than 80% of companies responding to a recent survey from McKinsey said they did not feel well-prepared to deal with rising volatility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Slide5.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296182i24363C9628CC4E55/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide5.JPG" alt="Slide5.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What are organizations looking to achieve? Well, in order to deal with faster change, we need to transform transformation — accelerate our ability to innovate. In conversations with you, our customers, we find three key themes. First, companies are looking to better connect and coordinate their teams across internal silos so the company can act as one. Second, they're looking to take advantage of AI and automation to be able to adjust back-end systems faster than is possible when everything is done manually. Third, everyone wants to explore new business models: selling connected services rather than just products, or moving to subscription pricing, or developing more customized services, and so on.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So while it's difficult to create a formal ROI case for business agility, the reality is it makes the difference between surviving and thriving. The ability to change faster than the competition is one of THE biggest and most powerful differentiators you can have in your industry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Slide6.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296183i729639E6B9E58903/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide6.JPG" alt="Slide6.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;But you don't need me to tell you that change is hard. You probably have lots of disparate, disconnected systems that have grown up over the years, and they all talk different languages. Maintenance probably takes up a big chunk of your time and resources. Making changes means wading into custom code and integrations and involves a lot of costs and above all, risk. These are, after all, the systems that keep your business running. And it can be difficult finding the people with the right skills to solve today's technology challenges. And the data backs this up.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;70% of CIOs say their current systems lack the agility to scale and integrate with modern technologies like AI. 80% of CIOs cite data quality and semantic challenges as their biggest obstacles to AI success. And 45% of businesses operating on legacy systems are less likely to adopt enterprise-wide AI due to technology limitations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Slide8.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296184iD0897A88DFE05F06/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide8.JPG" alt="Slide8.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We all know that business transformation isn't about technology, but it certainly relies heavily on it. So the CIO has a critical role helping shepherd the competing demands from different areas of the business while maintaining a coherent technology strategy and governance. At SAP, our &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-suite.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Business Suite vision&lt;/A&gt; aims to enable CIOs as transformational chief innovation officers rather than just chief infrastructure officers. Where IT is a strategic partner for the organization, and goes beyond IT management to drive transformation: aligning technology with the business goals.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform is what we use as the foundation for SAP's own innovations, and we have over 150 different applications running on the platform. But of course, we also make it available to you and our vast ecosystem of partners to help all areas of the business succeed, in partnership with the CIO. The platform is most often used by IT departments, but it's all about creating better business outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Slide10.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296185i0E09B040A4693BB7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide10.JPG" alt="Slide10.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So what is &lt;A href="http://sap.com/btp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP&lt;/A&gt;? Well, it's a multi-cloud platform-as-a-service to unlock the full potential of your business. Optimized to work with SAP solutions, it's a unified platform of best of breed technologies to extend and integrate business applications and to infuse artificial intelligence and context-aware business data into everything you do.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We know that there are lots of different development environments out there, so when and why might SAP BTP be the right solution for your business needs? First, we've been in the business of business processes for decades. SAP BTP has out-of-the-box support to connect your processes and applications to just about any other system and application on the planet. Second, it's built for business. When you're designing something to extend your existing business applications and processes, there's no point reinventing the wheel. You can just quickly and easily leverage all the user object to security information that's already in your system. Third, we've been building AI into our applications for years, and while it's easy to do quick and powerful proof of concept projects with the latest gen AI technology, all the analyst research research shows that the vast majority of AI projects fail to go into production or add business value. We have deep expertise in helping our customers build mission-critical systems. We built robust assembly lines to integrate relevant, reliable and responsible business AI into all of our applications and we provide the same tested, production-ready tools to you. And finally, studies have proved that BTP adds value to other SAP Business Suite applications with a strong return on investment when BTP is deployed together with applications like SAP Cloud ERP, Successfactors, Ariba, and Finance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP BTP is available globally with 42 data centers worldwide. It's helped over 33,000 customers achieve measurable impact across all industries and lines of business. Over 10,000 pre-built best practice artifacts speed up your time to value with pre-implemented workflows, and with a growing ecosystem of 3,200 partners that have built industry and line of business solutions on top of the platform, you're likely to find out-of-the-box solutions for your particular needs. And SAP BTP is recognized by leading analyst firms as a best in class vendor, leading in numerous technology categories.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's dive into the real content. SAP BTP covers five major solution areas: integration, application development and automation, artificial intelligence, data and analytics, and platform foundation. Let's look at each of these key areas in a bit more detail.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Slide17.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296186iF4D5EFE2F68480C6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide17.JPG" alt="Slide17.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, integration. Integration is one of the most time consuming and painful parts of any innovation project today. Organizations typically juggle multiple integration solutions, creating complexity, which in turn leads to longer projects and disjointed systems that continue to jeopardize business resiliency. So how does Integration Suite help with these challenges? &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/integration-suite.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Integration Suite&lt;/A&gt; is a modern, scalable, and secure integration platform-as-a-service, empowering businesses to integrate all applications, systems and data across all landscapes, with one solution offering comprehensive capabilities to accelerate productivity and ensure reliable connectivity. Thousands of pre-built content allow you to deploy faster and more easily, greatly increasing your time to value. There are over 3,900 built-in integrations, over 4,000 ready-to-use integration APIs for faster connectivity, and &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/integration-suite.html?campaigncode=CRM-YJ25-BTP-3012044&amp;amp;url_id=gartner-magic-quadrant-for-intergration-suite&amp;amp;rc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gartner.com%2Freprints%2F%3Fid%3D1-2L1PIDWJ%26ct%3D250521%26st%3Dsb" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Gartner recently rated SAP Integration Suite a market leader&lt;/A&gt; for the fifth consecutive year running.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2024/02/aa091694-aa7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Harrods&lt;/A&gt;, the iconic luxury department store first opened its doors in Knightsbridge, London, in 1849. To support its digital transformation and strategic shift to a modern e-commerce platform, the company selected SAP Integration Suite to connect both cloud and on-premise technologies, internal and third-party systems across multiple protocols, all within a single platform. The result was a 40% reduction in total costs and 30% shorter process times, and with the standardization, Harrods can now more easily engage with partners and expand its global presence to meet increased customer demand in new markets, including China and the Middle East.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Slide22.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296187iFB80E1E44FE2DFB9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide22.JPG" alt="Slide22.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The second solution area for BTP is application development and automation. Building and extending enterprise applications with the wrong tools can be difficult and expensive, and deep collaboration between the business is always required for a successful outcome. Extensions need to be securely integrated with your core business systems. This is where &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/build.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Build&lt;/A&gt; comes in. It provides tools for all levels of expertise, from professional developers to power users who only want to drag and drop to create applications. Analyst studies show that &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/02/5cf902d0-f37e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Build drives 3X developer productivity&lt;/A&gt; and you can start coding with natural language: AI now understands your business, technology, data, and context. Deep integration with SAP and non-SAP applications provides the fastest way to create an application, automated process, or business site in a clean-core way. There are already over 17,000 customers using SAP Build solutions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, in order to engage with the Gen Z audience, engineering multinational &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2024/06/225e0085-c67e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ThyssenKrupp&lt;/A&gt; has launched a new social media recruiting channel. The core of this approach is an app built in-house using the low-code SAP Build Apps development environment, helping citizen developers create and manage workflows for different HR applications. The intuitive app empowers personnel in more than 100 different HR departments to quickly create application flows for different job types, without needing any coding skills. This helps ThyssenKrupp respond to changing recruitment requirements in an agile and efficient way.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Slide27.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296191iC7D064691547033E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide27.JPG" alt="Slide27.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The third solution area of BTP we’ll look at is artificial intelligence. We could obviously talk for hours about AI, but the key challenges are that there are not enough resources to adopt AI as quickly as everybody would like across the enterprise, that the business data required for scaling AI is typically very fragmented, and that large language models are not always accurate and trustworthy. The &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI in BTP&lt;/A&gt; is designed for trust. We have built a production-ready AI orchestration platform to allow you to embed AI into all of your business processes with confidence. We use that platform to provide over 230 individual use cases across the SAP Business Suite, and we're training specific AI models on high-quality, industry-specific tabular business data, and leveraging our deep process knowledge. In addition, AI is built into all of the BTP solutions such as Joule studio and Build for developers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, when Germany was hit by a sharp rise in energy prices recently because of getting cut off from Russian gas, the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2025/01/a2676ba3-ef7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;City of Hamburg&lt;/A&gt; used SAP AI services and other solutions to efficiently process almost 100,000 applications relating to aid. The financial aid platform was launched in only two weeks, and allowed the city of Hamburg to start distributing €2.5 billion in special fund to public and private cultural institutions. It's an intuitive, self-service platform that leverages generative AI to support a digitalized application process for cultural events, including the initial request, the validity checks, objection handling and payment. BTP and AI greatly sped up the processing of the applications far quicker than would otherwise been possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Slide32.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296192iC0369B640FB01CAC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide32.JPG" alt="Slide32.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The fourth solution area of BTP is data and analytics provided by &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/data-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Business Data Cloud&lt;/A&gt;. Business users need data for all of their analytics planning needs in real time, with full business context. At SAP, we believe this requires integration between all data platforms and business applications with data products based on a one-domain model for consistency—and connecting insights and business decisions is now more important than ever in the new AI era. SAP Business Data Cloud accelerates the process of turning data into decisions with “insights-as-a-service”: pre-built, out-of-the-box analytic apps to help you make smart decisions faster. They leverage fully-managed, curated data products across all lines of business, providing advanced analytics and planning apps across core enterprise, analytics, finance, people, and much more. It unifies and governs all SAP data and seamlessly connects with third party data using Delta Sharing and Data Federation to connect all your data with zero copies. And you can easily create AI apps and AI models trained on your business data, using for example, SAP Databricks.

It federated SAP and third-party data while preserving key metadata, making it available for analytics and business intelligence. They took data from over 20 different cloud and on-premise systems scattered across various subsidiaries, and brought it all together for a consolidated 360 degree view of the organization's financial performance, with greater spend transparency across various source systems, helping deliver better margins and resilience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Slide37.JPG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296193i9C27830C3E1C7FAD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide37.JPG" alt="Slide37.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The fifth and final key solution area of BTP is the platform foundation. With threat vectors from many sources, companies are prioritizing security at the highest levels. At the same time, IT leaders need to streamline operations while providing the application scalability needed for the business to stay competitive. &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP Platform Foundation&lt;/A&gt; provides the secure, scalable and reliable foundation you need to innovate with confidence across your business suite.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In the fast-evolving semiconductor industry, understanding market demand is both critical and challenging. Modern data spaces—secure, collaborative environments where multiple organizations share data—offer new opportunities for more targeted and privacy-preserving demand collection. One innovative approach combines Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and verifiable credential (VC) vouchers to streamline questionnaire management within these data spaces, balancing control, security, and participant autonomy.Scenario Overview&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine a data space consisting of several semiconductor manufacturers, suppliers, and customers who share and analyze market-relevant data. A central operator is responsible for orchestrating activities such as conducting demand questionnaires. When a new demand questionnaire is to be launched, the operator:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creates the Questionnaire: The operator designs the survey and defines eligibility criteria.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Selects Participants: A selected set of companies are chosen to respond, based on criteria such as region, company type, or previous participation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Issues Vouchers: For access control and tracking, the operator generates individual questionnaire vouchers, implemented as verifiable credentials (VCs).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Delivers Vouchers: Each selected participant receives their unique VC voucher in their SSI wallet.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Participant submits survey and uses voucher&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Participants wishing to respond must not only submit the completed questionnaire but also cryptographically prove their eligibility and participation using their questionnaire voucher.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's break down how this system works from a technical perspective.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1736883657"&gt;Implementing Questionnaire Vouchers with Self-Sovereign Identity&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Questionnaire Creation and Participant Selection&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The central operator, with authority in the data space, defines the questionnaire’s structure and the set of questions to be asked.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The operator identifies a list of eligible participants (e.g., certain manufacturers or suppliers).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Issuing Personalized Questionnaire Vouchers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For each selected participant, the operator creates a &lt;STRONG&gt;Questionnaire Voucher VC&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This digital VC attests that the holder is invited to respond to a specific questionnaire.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This voucher VC may include metadata such as: Questionnaire ID, Expiry date, Participant’s organizational identifier (may be pseudonymous), Operator’s signature and issuance timestamp. The voucher VC is cryptographically signed by the operator, serving as the issuer.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Distributing Vouchers via SSI Wallets&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Each participant has an SSI wallet—a secure application or service capable of receiving, storing, and presenting VCs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The central operator pushes the individual voucher VC to each participant’s SSI wallet, typically via secure data space messaging protocols (like DCP).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Participant Submission Process: &lt;/STRONG&gt;When a participant is ready to respond, the process is as follows: Identification &amp;amp; Eligibility Demonstration: The participant identifies with the questionnaire portal using a verifiable presentation (VP) including the &amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Questionnaire Voucher VC&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This proves to the operator that the submission is uniquely authorized for this questionnaire and prevents duplicate or unauthorized submissions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Response Submission: &lt;/STRONG&gt;The participant fills in and submits the questionnaire through the portal, attaching the required VPs. The operator’s backend verifies the voucher, ensuring only authorized participants’ responses are accepted and counted. The operator revokes the voucher VC so that it can be used only once.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1540370152"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1343856647"&gt;Example Setup Guide: SSI and Questionnaire Vouchers for Demand Collection&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following guide outlines the steps for using SSI components for a demo of demand collection using Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and questionnaire voucher verifiable credentials (VCs) in a simulated semiconductor demand forecast environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The scenario involves an Operator—the trusted orchestrator—and a Participants—organization invited to respond to a new market demand questionnaire.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1276425861"&gt;Technical Stack&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This demo spotlights the core Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) workflow for secure questionnaire access using SAP’s Decentralized Identity Verification (DIV). The example abstracts away the questionnaire application itself, focusing purely on the exchange and verification of Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The operator uses DIV to issue VCs (Membership and Questionnaire Voucher) and verify credential presentations. Each participant uses an DIV tenant to: Receive and store VCs and create verifiable presentations (VPs).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1079912356"&gt;Step 0: Prerequisites&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before creating a DIV tenant, ensure that:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you have not yet subscribed, go to the SAP Partner Portal and subscribe to the TDD license:&amp;nbsp;SAP Partner Portal - TDD License. Once subscribed, you get an DIV entitlement. In a second step the provisioning can be triggered from SAP for Me. Therefore you need a S-User with admin rights.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You have the necessary&amp;nbsp;administrative permissions&amp;nbsp;in SAP BTP to create tenants.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/provisioning-saps-self-sovereign-identity-wallet-decentralized-identity/ba-p/14054164" target="_blank"&gt;... more information&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-883398851"&gt;Step 1: Environment Preparation – Create DIV Tenants&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-815968065"&gt;Operator Tenant Setup&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Set up a DIV tenant for the operator with both protocol roles: „dcp-holder“ and „dcp-issuer“.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;POST {provisioning_service}/api/v1.0.0/operations

Therefore the participant has to create a verifiable presentation including the VC.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="presentation.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296797i5CD6EF9BDCC4BC07/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="presentation.png" alt="presentation.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Get Credentials

The operator then validates the included Verifiable Credential (voucher) by performing the following checks: verifying that each VC has not been revoked, confirming that each VC was issued by a trusted issuer, ensuring that all VCs are still within their validity period (not expired), and validating the cryptographic signature on the presentation. Only if all these checks are successfully passed is the VP accepted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="verify.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/296808i1C10E4AE8FBD6925/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="verify.png" alt="verify.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Verify VP
POST {div_ srv}/api/v2.0.0/presentations/
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}

This revocation ensures that the credential cannot be verified successfully a second time, thus preventing reuse or fraudulent redemption attempts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;PATCH {{div_wallet_srv}}/api/v2.0.0/credentials/{{vc.response.body.data.0.id}}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{get_xsuaa_token.response.body.access_token}}

{
    "payload" : {
        "revoke" : true
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1256591571"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;By leveraging the power of Self-Sovereign Identity and verifiable credentials, questionnaire-driven demand collection in semiconductor data spaces becomes both secure and flexible. The voucher-based approach ensures invitations can’t be spoofed or misused, and that only intended participants contribute to strategic market analyses. As data sharing ecosystems mature, patterns like these will be crucial for trustworthy, privacy-preserving collaboration across industry boundaries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1453105076"&gt;References&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/self-sovereign-identity-ssi-a-usage-catalyst-for-dataspaces/ba-p/14054162" target="_self"&gt;Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): A Usage Catalyst for Dataspaces&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/DECENTRALIZED_IDENTITY_VERIFICATION/a1fc8fb2d89041b3849442692b2504b0/69d209bddb6e406088fb70b8e931c546.html?version=CLOUD" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP help: Documentation of the DIV Provisioning Service&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/DIVProvisioning/resource/Operations" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;API documentation&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;SAP BTP&amp;nbsp;(Business Technology Platform) allows you to create &lt;STRONG&gt;service keys&lt;/STRONG&gt; of type &lt;STRONG&gt;certificate&lt;/STRONG&gt;. These certificates can be exported from BTP and imported into other systems as client certificates to securely call SAP BTP services using certificate-based authentication.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, the BTP cockpit provides the certificate chain and the private key only in text form. While some systems may accept this format, others&amp;nbsp;require the upload of a certificate file containing all these details in one piece. (In addition, since it carries the certificate's private key, this file should usually be encrypted.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I recently set up the integration between SAP Sales/Service Cloud Version 2 and SAP Integration Suite/Cloud Integration, in which I had to convert the textual details from the service key into an encrypted PFX file.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While such tasks are often carried out with command-line tools, such as OpenSSL, where you need to remember all the correct commands, I was looking for an easy GUI-based approach. In this blog I want to explain how to create the PFX certificate with the free, multi-platform GUI tool &lt;A href="https://keystore-explorer.org/index.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;KeyStore Explorer&lt;/A&gt;, which is very helpful for this task.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The process consists of three simple tasks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create text files for the certificate chain and the key&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Import these files into KeyStore Explorer&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Save them as PFX file&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1736969032"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Create Text Files&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Open the service key details in SAP BTP and switch to &lt;STRONG&gt;Form&lt;/STRONG&gt; view.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="00 BTP ServiceKey2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298116i42C03467ECE4CC37/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="00 BTP ServiceKey2.png" alt="00 BTP ServiceKey2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Certificate Chain:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Copy the text from the &lt;STRONG&gt;certificate&lt;/STRONG&gt; field into an empty text file and insert line breaks so that&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/FONT&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;-----END CERTIFICATE-----&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the actual certificate content (which is &lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;Base64&lt;/FONT&gt; encoded) have separate lines. Save the file, for instance, as &lt;EM&gt;cert_chain.pem&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Please note&lt;/STRONG&gt; that the content from the certificate field contains the whole certificate chain consisting of three certificates.&lt;BR /&gt;The should look like this:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="01 Certchain Textfile.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298117i97F311622D0937C4/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="01 Certchain Textfile.png" alt="01 Certchain Textfile.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Private Key:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Copy the text from the &lt;STRONG&gt;key&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;field into an empty text file and insert line breaks so that&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----&lt;/FONT&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the actual key content (which is &lt;FONT face="courier new,courier"&gt;Base64&lt;/FONT&gt; encoded) have separate lines.

Import Text Files&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Open KeyStore Explorer and create a new keystore with the type&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;PKCS#12&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="01 KSE Create.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298119i93B0201DEFDB6901/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="01 KSE Create.png" alt="01 KSE Create.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select the &lt;EM&gt;Import Key Pair&lt;/EM&gt; button in the toolbar and choose &lt;STRONG&gt;OpenSSL&lt;/STRONG&gt; as import type. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="02 KSE Import.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298120i0F6503AC92441FCD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="02 KSE Import.png" alt="02 KSE Import.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the import dialog, uncheck the &lt;EM&gt;Encrypted Private Key&lt;/EM&gt; checkbox and provide the previously created files for the private key and the certificate file.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="03 KSE Import Files.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298121iF0C26E2AB8A4A9C2/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="03 KSE Import Files.png" alt="03 KSE Import Files.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;You will be prompted for an alias for the keystore. You can simply accept the suggested one. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="04 KSE Import 3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298122i60BF511D87738755/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="04 KSE Import 3.png" alt="04 KSE Import 3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another dialog will appear that asks you to enter a &lt;EM&gt;New Key Pair Entry Password&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;Enter a strong password.&lt;BR /&gt;My suggestion: Generate a password with a password manager to store it securely, and Copy&amp;amp;Paste it.&lt;BR /&gt;We'll need this password again when saving the PFX file and later when importing it into the target system/tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="05 KSE Import 4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298123i9AE708E55FE76055/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="05 KSE Import 4.png" alt="05 KSE Import 4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With that, we have all the necessary details in the keystore and can view all the details of the imported files:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="06 KSE Certchain Details.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298131i5BFD13212B85861F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="06 KSE Certchain Details.png" alt="06 KSE Certchain Details.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1343942022"&gt;3. Save PFX File&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;With the full certificate chain and the private key imported into the key store, we can now save the keystore as PFX file.&lt;BR /&gt;In this step, we have to enter a password again to protect the file (since it contains the secret private key).&lt;BR /&gt;Use the same password as during the import. This password will also be needed when uploading the PFX file into a system/tool of your preference.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="07 KSE Save PFX.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298128iAEF3B3B00F8FF07C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="07 KSE Save PFX.png" alt="07 KSE Save PFX.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the last step, enter a filename for the PFX file, for instance &lt;EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;client_cert_enc.pfx&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="08 KSE Save Filename.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298129iC203732B80A217AC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="08 KSE Save Filename.png" alt="08 KSE Save Filename.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;That's it! Now you can import the PFX file into the system/tool where you need it. For instance into the Communication System of an SAP Sales/Service Cloud Version 2 system:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="09 SSCv2 Import PFX.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/298130i7BD4B1C6D28399F8/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="09 SSCv2 Import PFX.png" alt="09 SSCv2 Import PFX.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this blog is helpful!&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This blog post covers how to setup an extension scenario from SAP S/4HANA Cloud and build Side-by-Side UI Extensions with the help of SAP Build Apps in the Business Technology Platform.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business scenario:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A Manager wants to define business objects “Bonus Plan” for employees. A Bonus Plan is there to save employee specific rules for bonus entitlement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here, with Key User Extensibility, we create a custom Business Object with a data structure, logic for data&amp;nbsp;initialization in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition which should have standard API operations (GET, POST, DELETE). Expose the custom business object&amp;nbsp;as web service for side-by-side UI extension using Low-code No-code capabilities of SAP Build Apps. You will learn how quickly a new UI application can be developed with the no-code capabilities of SAP Build Apps.

Create a personalised, accessible application that securely connects to data from SAP S/4HANA Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To extend SAP S/4HANA Cloud using SAP Build Apps, you can&amp;nbsp;leverage side-by-side extensibility, which allows you to build extensions that run on SAP BTP and interact with your S/4HANA Cloud system.&amp;nbsp;This approach enables you to create custom UIs, logic, and integrations without directly modifying the core S/4HANA Cloud system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="ShivaniShankar_9-1754553693970.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297772i0D15D1C28871EFDF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ShivaniShankar_9-1754553693970.png" alt="ShivaniShankar_9-1754553693970.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607861482"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s start on the SAP S/4HANA Cloud side with the definition of the Custom Business Object and the communication settings.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1540430696"&gt;Custom Business Object&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/group.abap-extensibiliy-cbo-cce-ccl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Create Custom Business Objects in SAP S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;tutorial group it is shown how to create a custom business object and generate a UI (user interface) in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1343917191"&gt;Expose Custom Business Object as External API&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To integrate custom business object from SAP S/4HANA system with External Systems or Services like&amp;nbsp;SAP Build Apps,&amp;nbsp;as administrator you need to create a&amp;nbsp;Communication Arrangement. You create a communication arrangement to enable the communication between your system and SAP Build App in BTP, and how they communicate. Communication Arrangement is formed by combining the below artifacts:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Creating a Custom Communication Scenario&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The setup of the communication (inbound and outbound) between SAP S/4HANA and SAP BTP starts with the definition of a Custom Communication Scenario.&lt;BR /&gt;The Custom Communication Scenario contains the information for both inbound and outbound HTTP-calls.&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Open the app Custom Communication Scenarios in the Launchpad of the SAP S/4 HANA system and create a new Custom Communication Scenario with the name YY1_BONUSPLAN.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="ShivaniShankar_10-1754553693977.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297770iC7E1D88A6CE7471D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ShivaniShankar_10-1754553693977.png" alt="ShivaniShankar_10-1754553693977.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On the tab Inbound Services, you create an entry for your Custom Business Object: Press Add button to add inbound service “YY1_BONUSPLAN_CDS” and click select button.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="ShivaniShankar_11-1754553693995.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297771i82F0B5227F8DC366/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ShivaniShankar_11-1754553693995.png" alt="ShivaniShankar_11-1754553693995.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Press Save and Publish to finish the custom communication scenario creation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Creating a Communication System and User&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;P&gt;To enable secure communication between different systems you have to register these systems and define the user which is authorized to use the connection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The communication system represents the communication partner within a communication. for inbound communication, this is the external system that calls our custom Bonus plan service.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’ll create one Communication System for all systems that want to use our service as well as the user that they’ll have to use. If you want to access the custom BONUSPLAN OData service (Inbound) you also need to setup an authentication method. You can use several methods like e.g.., Basic Authentication, Certificate or OAuth.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this case we are choosing Basic Authentication for which you need to setup a Communication User. Open the app Maintain Communication Users from the Communication Management group and create there a new user with username, description, and password.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Open “Communication Systems” Application.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Start creating a new system by executing the “New” action.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Give following data to the new custom communication System…&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note: you can replace XXX with your system ID.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="594"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="151"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Field Label&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="443"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Field Value&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="151"&gt;&lt;P&gt;System ID&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="443"&gt;&lt;P&gt;EXTERNAL_SYSTEMXXX&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="151"&gt;&lt;P&gt;System Name&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="443"&gt;&lt;P&gt;EXTERNAL_SYSTEMXXX&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="151"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Host Name&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="443"&gt;&lt;P&gt;EXTERNAL_SYSTEMXXX&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Scroll down to “User for Inbound Communication” and start adding one by executing the “Add” action.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the Pop Up, use the value help to browse and select the user.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="ShivaniShankar_0-1754563651591.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297893i3074475486D21581/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ShivaniShankar_0-1754563651591.png" alt="ShivaniShankar_0-1754563651591.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Choose the user you already created and then click OK.

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607745164"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Datasphere Task Chains have recently been enhanced with a new capability: the ability to add a REST API Step, as documented by SAP. This addition significantly expands the integration potential of Task Chains, allowing them to trigger or interact with external systems via REST APIs—something previously not possible within the task chain framework itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While SAP Datasphere already offers a Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with its environment, I believe that technical automation—especially triggering Task Chains—should be handled via REST endpoints wherever possible. (Yes, I am aware this is already on the roadmap.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have followed the evolution of SAP Analytics Cloud, you have likely noticed how its REST API capabilities have grown considerably. This trend strongly suggests a broader strategic shift within SAP toward more API-driven architectures.&lt;BR /&gt;Beyond the technical implications, this new feature offers a glimpse into how future data and analytics architectures might be designed. The ability to call external REST APIs directly from within a Task Chain is a small yet significant change—it paves the way for loosely coupled, event-driven, and more modular system landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post, I will explore the broader implications of this feature—looking at both architectural perspectives and practical use cases—to illustrate how this seemingly simple addition might shape our thinking on modern data platform design going forward. The different implications and perspectives I will try to sketch out in this blog post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1411231659"&gt;Integration Perspective&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this new capability, you can invoke a REST service directly within a process step. What could such a REST service do? Here are a few examples:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Microservices and Third-Party Data Sources - Trigger a microservice that extracts data from a third-party system and writes it into SAP Datasphere using the OPEN SQL schema.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Advanced Analytics on External Buckets - Initiate a predictive analytics process after data has been pushed to an external storage location (e.g., a Google Cloud Storage bucket), leveraging external computation power or models.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Endless Possibilities - from orchestrating workflows to enriching data pipelines with external intelligence.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This simple yet powerful feature drastically lowers the barrier for integrating external systems. Especially in modern, heterogeneous IT landscapes, the ability to seamlessly interact with REST services is crucial. As solutions increasingly span multiple platforms and technologies, having native support for REST APIs within Task Chains enables more modular, scalable, and interoperable architectures.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1214718154"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="christian_willi_2-1754304878655.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295957iC56512F19FC536BB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="christian_willi_2-1754304878655.png" alt="christian_willi_2-1754304878655.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1018204649"&gt;SAC Seamless Planning Perspective&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;At present, Seamless Planning in SAP provides only a foundational set of features. However, even with these basic capabilities, it is now possible to trigger a Multi Action in SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)—with some lightweight technical implementation, such as a microservice on SAP BTP to handle user propagation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What Does This Enable?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It opens the door to scheduling planning-related actions that can be executed automatically—daily, during off-peak hours, or at custom intervals—all orchestrated directly from SAP Datasphere. This marks a significant step toward greater automation and operational efficiency in planning processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking ahead, the possibility of triggering a Task Chain from within a Multi Action (either via SAP’s upcoming official Task Chain Trigger feature or through a custom-built solution) would close the loop, enabling bi-directional process orchestration between SAC and Datasphere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A Vision of Integration - Imagine this scenario:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Master data is loaded from an S/4HANA system into Datasphere (where the Master data may be managed in the future) and updated in the planning model.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Once this loading process is completed, a Data Action is automatically triggered to generate the necessary planning combinations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Each step is orchestrated across systems—seamlessly integrating Datasphere and SAC.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This evolving capability points to a promising future, where SAP’s tools are moving toward more open, event-driven, and tightly connected architectures. It is a strong signal of the direction SAP is heading—toward building truly integrated, cross-platform planning and data ecosystems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="christian_willi_3-1754304951043.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/295958iF2A9C4185F92B9C1/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="christian_willi_3-1754304951043.png" alt="christian_willi_3-1754304951043.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-821691144"&gt;Process Orchestration&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;As outlined in the sections above, these new capabilities significantly enhance our ability to orchestrate analytics processes—in ways that were not possible just a few weeks ago. The integration of REST API steps and the evolving connectivity between SAP Datasphere and SAC unlocks a new level of flexibility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What makes this particularly compelling is the ease with which we can now develop lightweight microservices on SAP BTP to support and extend these interactions. Whether it is handling authentication, user propagation, or orchestrating complex logic between systems, BTP provides a robust platform for embedding custom logic into an increasingly modular and responsive analytics architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-625177639"&gt;The On-Premises Thoughts&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have already referred several times to the concept of a “small microservice on SAP BTP.” This idea becomes especially relevant when you consider that SAP Datasphere is still often used alongside SAP BW, where orchestration tasks are traditionally handled via Process Chains and ABAP reports.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In many discussions—whether with internal teams or external consultants—there remains a strong inclination to implement logic directly within the ABAP stack of on-premise systems. This is understandable. It is what I would call the “home-field advantage”: familiarity, confidence, and reliability in an environment they know well. They’re certain it will work—but the question we must ask is: Will this remain a sustainable approach over the next 5 to 10 years?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The reality is that, SAP’s Business Data Cloud is on the rise, and the centrality of BW in analytics architectures is gradually diminishing. So why not embrace a more future proof approach?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By building a lightweight REST service on SAP BTP, we gain a flexible, scalable solution that can be triggered both by SAP BW and SAP Datasphere. This doesn’t just modernize our architecture—it lays the groundwork for future-proof integration patterns, better modularity, and easier maintenance in a cloud-centric world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-428664134"&gt;A broader architectural perspective&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another powerful dimension of this development is the ability to interact with a broader range of services available on SAP BTP, such as SAP Event Mesh. For example, you could emit an event to a queue and have that event trigger specific reactions among subscribed services. This pattern—similar to what has long been possible in SAP Data Intelligence using simple Pub/Sub mechanisms—enables a much cleaner, event-driven architecture that is better aligned with modern cloud-native design principles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But this blog is not just about the “small” new feature of the REST API step. It is about what this feature represents: a clear signal of how the SAP Analytics ecosystem is rapidly evolving toward the Business Data Cloud—with SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud, and SAP Databricks at its core (leaving SAP BW Private Cloud Edition aside for now).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This shift demands a mindset change for analytics consultants. To remain relevant and deliver robust solutions, we must go beyond our comfort zones and understand how SAP BTP enriches this ecosystem. That includes learning how to build with CAP or UI5, orchestrate processes using SAP Build, and embrace loosely coupled, service-based thinking.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s no longer just about reporting and data modeling—it's about understanding how to leverage the entire BTP toolset to design smarter, more flexible processes that are fit for the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-232150629"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The REST API step in SAP Datasphere Task Chains is much more than a technical enhancement—it is a strategic inflection point. It pushes SAP architecture toward:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Greater openness and interoperability&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Microservice- and event-driven thinking&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tighter orchestration between SAC, Datasphere, and BTP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A cleaner transition from legacy on-prem ABAP logic&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The future is modular, cloud-native, and integrated—and this is your chance to start designing for it.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607924656"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to connect Cloud Integration with Document AI. As a use case, let’s consider a scenario where a hospital registers a new patient, and the patient submits their previous prescription records. Using Document AI, we can extract relevant details such as past illnesses, allergies, and the patient’s blood group.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1411411151"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Document AI:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1&lt;/STRONG&gt;. As a pre-requisite, run a booster to activate Document AI in a trial account.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reference link: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-aibus-dox-booster-key.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Use Trial to Set Up Account for SAP Document AI and Get Service Key&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Create a custom schema as shown below.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="pic1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299078i876DDC7000A272CB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="pic1.png" alt="pic1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Upload sample prescriptions. Here, I have uploaded two prescriptions of a&amp;nbsp;patient (merged into a single PDF). &lt;EM&gt;Please note that all the data is fictitious.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="pic2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299079i67D96ABDEC86A48D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="pic2.png" alt="pic2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="pic3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299080i9F613DA1CF5B38C0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="pic3.png" alt="pic3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Verify the extraction results, if required edit and then confirm.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="pic4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299083iB54A73D12B3B235B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="pic4.png" alt="pic4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For this example we get confidence percentage is 51%-80%.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the SAP Mobile Start 2.4 release, users can leverage SAP Document AI—integrated seamlessly within the Mobile Start app—to transform document handling into a secure, intelligent, and automated experience. They can scan or upload documents directly from SAP Mobile Start, which are then processed by the SAP Document AI service.&amp;nbsp;This streamlines processing, cuts down manual work, and boosts data accuracy throughout your operations.&amp;nbsp;In this blog, I'll walk you through the integration steps, prerequisites, and configuration details needed to bring SAP Document AI capabilities to your mobile users.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1735962950"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Preconditions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before you begin, ensure the following prerequisites are fulfilled.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1797614883"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Subscribe to SAP Document AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensure that your SAP BTP subaccount is subscribed to the Document Information Extraction service. You can follow &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-aibus-dox-free-booster-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;this tutorial&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to get started. Once complete, access the SAP Document AI UI from your BTP subscriptions to configure document types and schemas relevant to your business scenarios. For more information on schema configuration, refer to the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/document-ai/sap-document-ai/schema-configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;official user guide&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1601101378"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enable Identity Authentication for SAP Build Work Zone&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In SAP Build Work Zone, navigate to Site Manager &amp;gt;

Depending on how the service was configured by the administrator, you may have the option to select a document type and schema.

The file size must not exceed 50 MB, and the document should contain no more than 100 pages. Additionally, file names are automatically sanitized to remove any invalid characters. Once these checks are successfully passed, the upload process begins, with a visible progress bar indicating status. Android users can upload multiple documents synchronously.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After the upload is complete, the document extraction workflow is triggered, and users receive a success notification confirming the process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--861750767"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Track Status and Review Document&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To monitor the progress of document extraction, simply open the Document Overview from the overflow menu within the document selection screen. This action launches the mobile-optimized SAP Document AI UI, providing a clear and intuitive view of the status, allowing reviews and other updates related to your uploaded documents.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="T3F.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297916iE46168103ABCA363/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="T3F.png" alt="T3F.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Screenshot: Track status and review document via mobile optimized UI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--471458258"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Conclusion&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the release of SAP Mobile Start 2.4 and the seamless integration of SAP Document AI, business users now benefit from a truly mobile-first, intelligent document processing experience.

The corresponding link will be added after its publication.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The content of this blog post will be continuously updated, and additional questions will be added.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1736944878"&gt;Overview SAP BTP ABAP Environment&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1927679530"&gt;What is the SAP BTP ABAP Environment?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/abap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP ABAP environment&lt;/A&gt; is the platform as a service for ABAP developers. It’s a cloud-optimized ABAP platform based on SAP HANA Cloud that serves as a development and runtime environment for cloud apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1731166025"&gt;What is ABAP Cloud and why is it needed?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP Cloud is specifically tailored to the needs of cloud development. ABAP Cloud is the new, modern approach to making ABAP development future-proof and cloud-ready. It is the ABAP development model for creating cloud-ready business apps, services, and extensions. It combines various cloud technologies for development, including ABAP Core Data Services (CDS) for data modeling, the ABAP RESTful application programming model (&lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/abap/rap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;RAP&lt;/A&gt;), SAP Fiori UI technology, and the ABAP Development Tools (ADT). It maintains a strict separation between SAP, customer, and partner coding.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is the necessary path for all extensions in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud environment and is also becoming increasingly important for on-premise systems. All cloud development must be implemented with ABAP Cloud; classic ABAP is not permitted in cloud applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1147404363"&gt;Use cases&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1338139015"&gt;What are typical use cases?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;The platform offers the possibility for a variety of individual solutions; the following list contains the most prominent examples.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Loosely coupled side-by-side extensions and applications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tightly coupled on-stack extensions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Hub-like usage for integration scenarios&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Partners can provide Multitenant SaaS solutions and the partner Add-on product&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1141625510"&gt;Who can use it?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;The environment can be used for different target groups, with respective features and use cases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For education:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Learn ABAP Cloud and evaluate the SAP BTP ABAP environment&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Try it out using the Trial Account or the Free Tier Option&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Free Tier systems can be smoothly converted into a standard system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For customer:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Develop and run loosely coupled side-by-side extensions for example for SAP S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Develop tightly coupled on-stack extensions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For partners:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Develop and run multitenancy-enabled SaaS applications for their customers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Develop and provide a partner Add-on product for customers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Of course, the SAP BTP ABAP environment is also used for internal scenarios, so that our own products run on it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-557863848"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-361350343"&gt;Benefits&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-552084995"&gt;What are the key benefits?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Extend SAP applications: Use the side-by-side approach to develop and run custom extensions for SAP S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accelerate cloud transformation: Reuse ABAP assets and knowledge to build breakthrough innovations in the cloud&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Keep the core clean: Transform on-premise custom code to a separate platform to decouple it from the digital core and profit from independent release cycles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-355571490"&gt;How can the environment be used in relation to clean core?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP BTP ABAP environment supports the concept of the clean core in several ways to ensure the maintainability, scalability, and long-term sustainability of ABAP-based solutions. Due to the enforced use of ABAP Cloud, the development is 100% clean core by default.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some aspects are listed here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cloud-native development: The SAP BTP ABAP environment enables developers to create cloud-native ABAP applications that can extend classic systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Side-by-Side Extensions: Using side-by-side extensions, customers can develop and deploy custom extensions outside of the core system. This minimizes the risk of disruptions caused by customizations in the core system and facilitates updates and upgrades.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use of APIs and services: SAP BTP ABAP environment supports an API-driven development approach, where applications communicate with other SAP systems via well-defined interfaces. There is also the option to use reuse services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Update and upgrade stability: The SAP BTP ABAP environment ensures that customer-specific customizations and extensions are separated from the core system, increasing stability during updates and upgrades. This minimizes the risk of conflicts and instability and enables regular updates and patches without impacting core processes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further information on Clean Core and Extensibility can be found in the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/10/52e0cd9b-497e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Extensibility Guide&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--761144836"&gt;Are there any AI features which can be used with the SAP BTP ABAP Environment?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is possible to use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-speaks-abap/ba-p/14018226" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Joule for Developers, ABAP AI capabilities&lt;/A&gt;. These include various features to support developers, for example, the unit test generation, the BO generator or the code completion. These features can be used in Eclipse together with the ABAP Development Tools (ADT). The AI features are part of a separate contract.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--77449320"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--273962825"&gt;Tools and Development&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--1350685351"&gt;Which tools and development IDEs are available for ABAP development in the cloud?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;The clear recommendation&amp;nbsp;is to use Eclipse together with ADT. In the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/technology-platform/business-application-studio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Application Studio&lt;/A&gt;, changes to the UI can be made if necessary. An introduction on how to connect the two systems can be found on this &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/abap-environment/creating-destination-to-abap-system-for-sap-business-application-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Page&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--1547198856"&gt;Where can I find resources and tutorials for development?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are various materials and tutorials available to help you get started with ABAP Cloud. The following are good starting points:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://github.com/orgs/SAP-samples/repositories?language=&amp;amp;q=rap+&amp;amp;sort=&amp;amp;type=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Development Tutorials on GitHub&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/practicing-clean-core-extensibility-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Learning Journey: Practicing Clean Core Extensibility For SAP S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/acquire-core-abap-skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Learning Journey: Acquiring Core ABAP Skills&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/certifications/sap-certified-associate-back-end-developer-abap-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Certified Associate: Back-End Developer - ABAP Cloud&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/tutorials-for-abap-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help Portal: Tutorials for ABAP Cloud&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What tools are available for lifecycle management?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are various tools for lifecycle management&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One is abapGit: This is used to transport development objects into SAP BTP ABAP instances. Its use as a transport system is not recommended. Furthermore, there is the git-enabled change and transport system (gCTS), which is used to transport objects between the dev and test systems. More information regarding gCTS can be found in this &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/gcts-is-here/ba-p/13444452" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt; in the SAP Community. It's also possible to use the existing Git within the company using the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/bring-your-own-git-for-sap-btp-abap-environment/bc-p/14093439" target="_blank"&gt;Bring-Your-Own-Git (BYOG) feature&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP Landscape Portal acts as a central tool to allow service providers to perform administration tasks such as hibernating systems, creating test tenants and support users, selecting systems for a pre-upgrade, but also lifecycle management operations such as building, deploying and updating product versions, and even guides you through the configuration and deployment of multitenant SaaS solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--1743712361"&gt;Are there any limitations on on-stack development? Like creation of RAP objects via ADT?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP cloud is mandatory for the SAP BTP ABAP environment, so only ADT is available. The recommended programming model is the ABAP RESTful application programming model (&lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/abap/rap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;RAP&lt;/A&gt;). There are no restrictions on RAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1060016845"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1256530350"&gt;System Management and Administration&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1961714420"&gt;How does the standard sizing look like?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system consists of two components: the runtime, called &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/creating-abap-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ABAP Compute Unit&lt;/A&gt; (ACU), and the persistence, called &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/creating-abap-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;HANA Compute Unit&lt;/A&gt; (HCU). The minimum system size includes one ACU and two HCUs. We recommend starting with this configuration; later adjustments are possible at any time. Even one ACU is very powerful and can serve 1,000&amp;nbsp;business users in a single day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1765200915"&gt;How can the systems be managed and administered?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;General system configuration, such as setting up systems, adjusting metrics, and creating subaccounts, is performed via the SAP BTP Cockpit. Further specific system management is performed via the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/landscape-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Landscape Portal&lt;/A&gt;, which is included with every system and is free to use. This allows for a wide variety of administrative and configuration tasks, such as user and role management, &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-btp-abap-environment-manage-system-hibernation/ba-p/13566169" target="_blank"&gt;system hibernation&lt;/A&gt;, and application deployment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1736871101"&gt;How can the system size be adjusted?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system size can be adjusted manually via the SAP BTP Cockpit. This applies to both ACUs and HCUs. The customer and partner can make the size adjustment themselves and independently. Furthermore, there is the possibility to use system hibernation and elastic scaling, more on this in the next section.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1540357596"&gt;How are the ACUs scaling with the increasing number of users?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;An ACU is capable of serving 1,000 active business users per day. If the number of users increases, the number of ACUs must also be adjusted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1343844091"&gt;Will the system upgrades cause downtime for my systems?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standard upgrades require a planned downtime of the systems. The downtimes are covered by contractual SLAs and the schedule is announced in advance for the whole calendar year (see this &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-btp-abap-environment-maintenance-windows-and-major-upgrade-windows-in/ba-p/13920833" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt;). A down-time optimized approach is in place for productive systems. The required technical downtime will be reduced in further releases. The individual phases of the upgrade are described in this blog post in the SAP Community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1147330586"&gt;Does the entire system landscape have to be created right at the beginning?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;No, we recommend setting up the systems when they are needed. This reduces complexity at the beginning, and you only pay for the systems you need at that moment. To begin, either the Free Tier system can be converted, or a new development system can be created in the SAP BTP Cockpit. Development can then take place there and all transports can be released. Next, the test system is created with the software component on which the development is based. Finally, the production system can be created. This way, the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/abap-environment/use-case-1-one-codeline-in-3-system-landscape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;three system landscape&lt;/A&gt; is built piece by piece based on the requirements. If systems are not in use, they can be shut down using system hibernation to save costs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-950817081"&gt;What are the recommendations for setting up subaccounts in the SAP BTP Cockpit?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;We recommend creating a separate subaccount for each system. This provides maximum flexibility regarding trust settings, which are always defined at the subaccount level. Of course, there are other development scenarios where multiple systems per subaccount would be helpful. However, we generally recommend one system per subaccount.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-754303576"&gt;If, in a three-system landscape (dev, quality, prod), the source code is transported from the development system to other systems, will duplicates be created in the database?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, each SAP BTP ABAP environment system has its own HANA Cloud instance, which is why duplicates occur.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1437999092"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1241485587"&gt;Hosting and Data Center&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-164763061"&gt;Which hyperscalers are available to host the systems?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are currently three different providers to choose from: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Furthermore, the option to use SAP as a hyperscaler will be added this year, so no external service provider is required. An overview of the hyperscalers can also be found in the &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/abap-environment?region=all&amp;amp;tab=service_plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP Discovery Center&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--31750444"&gt;In which data centers can the systems be located?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;The data centers are distributed globally and can be found in a wide variety of countries. EU access, for example, can also be granted. A complete list of all locations is available in the &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/abap-environment?commercialModel=btpea&amp;amp;tab=service_plan&amp;amp;region=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP Discovery Center&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--60080258"&gt;Can a synchronous replication be created as a backup from the SAP BTP ABAP Environment system?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;Starting in Q4/2025, it will be possible to create a so-called availability zone in which the system is replicated, more information in this &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/announcing-the-new-quot-in-metro-quot-disaster-recovery-solution-for-sap/ba-p/13904013" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt; in the SAP Community. This functionality is part of the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/resilience-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;in-metro disaster recovery feature of the SAP BTP&lt;/A&gt;. This occurs in the same data center region as the original system.

One is using the Trial Account with a shared instance, and the other is using the Free Tier Option with a private instance. Both options are time-limited; all information can be found in this dedicated &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/get-started-with-sap-btp-abap-environment-trial-account-vs-free-tier-option/ba-p/13663694" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt; in the SAP Community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--1042647783"&gt;Can the Free Tier Option be used, if a standard plan has already been activated?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, but it depends on the licensing model. For example, partners with subscription-based TDD cannot do this: if the contract allows for a free tier, it's possible. Free tier only applies to consumption-based, and is always limited to a maximum of one system. All information can be found in this dedicated &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/get-started-with-sap-btp-abap-environment-trial-account-vs-free-tier-option/ba-p/13663694" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt; in the SAP Community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--1239161288"&gt;Is the SAP BTP ABAP Environment part of SAP Build?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, the SAP BTP ABAP environment is part of SAP Build since Q3/2024. The ABAP Runtime can also be purchased with the SAP Build SKU 8019321. This is implemented in the form of a subscription model based on capacity units; there is no consumption-based variant. There is no technical difference to the well-established service plan standard.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="14.285714285714286%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;License&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="14.285714285714286%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Material Code&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="14.285714285714286%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Service Name&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="14.285714285714286%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Metric&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="14.285714285714286%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Block Size&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="14.285714285714286%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Min.

It simply involves changing the service plan. This service plan must be changed in the &lt;A href="https://account.hana.ondemand.com/#/home/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP Cockpit&lt;/A&gt;, which the customer can do themselves. The change has no impact on the system, which will remain as before, and nothing needs to be adjusted. There will be no downtime or anything similar&lt;STRONG&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--1632188298"&gt;Are there opportunities to optimize costs?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;There is the possibility to use the functionality of system hibernation, more information in this &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/optimize-your-sap-btp-abap-environment-budget-a-detailed-cost-analysis-for/ba-p/13574333" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt; in the SAP Community. This feature makes it possible to shut down development systems at a specific time when they are not needed. For example, the system can be shut down over the weekend. During this time, the costs for the ACU are waived and for the HCUs only 12.5% of the original costs must be paid (exactly 1/8 of the original price).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The manual adjustment of the ACUs and HCUs is quite static and cannot vary automatically according to the runtime. For this case, there is &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-btp-abap-environment-elastic-scaling-of-application-servers/ba-p/13614903" target="_blank"&gt;elastic scaling&lt;/A&gt;. The system continuously monitors utilization metrics and adjusts the number of application servers accordingly (up or down). This means customers only pay for actual usage, reducing costs while still ensuring sufficient capacity is available for peak loads when needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--1828701803"&gt;Does the number of technical objects in the SAP BTP ABAP Environment influence the costs incurred?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;No, the only metrics relevant for pricing are the system size, consisting of ACUs and HCUs. Other factors such as the number of users, number of requests, or number of technical objects have no impact on pricing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--976822596"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1173336101"&gt;Release Cycle and Roadmap&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-2044908669"&gt;In which cycle do the new releases come?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;New releases are delivered quarterly (February, May, August, and November). New data center locations are added independently throughout the year.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1848395164"&gt;Is it possible to try out the upcoming features before the actual upgrade?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the pre-upgrade option, systems can receive the new functionality before the actual upgrade. This always takes place approximately two weeks before the actual upgrade. This option offers customers and partners a longer testing period. There are fixed &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-btp-abap-environment-maintenance-windows-and-major-upgrade-windows-in/ba-p/13920833" target="_blank"&gt;maintenance and upgrade windows&lt;/A&gt; for both the upgrade and the pre-upgrade, which will be announced in advance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1651881659"&gt;Where can I find the external product roadmap?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;The external product roadmap can be found in the &lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?range=FIRST-LAST&amp;amp;PRODUCT=73555000100800001164#Q3%202024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Roadmap Explorer&lt;/A&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming enterprise software, bringing smarter automation, contextual insights, and enhanced user experiences to business-critical systems. In tax and accounting, where precision and compliance are essential, AI is helping organizations to manage complex data with greater agility and confidence. As regional SAP ICC representative and having worked closely with SAP Partners on their solutions' certification projects, I’ve seen firsthand how solutions that combine generative AI with robust platforms like SAP are redefining usability and performance. These innovations go beyond automation, delivering intelligent assistance tailored to the evolving demands of modern finance teams.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sonda.com/en/home" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SONDA&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, an SAP partner with headquarters in Chile and strong presence in Brazil, has been a driving force in digital transformation across the Americas. With expertise in tax management, SONDA delivers solutions to help companies navigate regulatory complexity and operational challenges through a portfolio of SAP-based solutions, automation and process integration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Among these, &lt;STRONG&gt;SONDA Gallery&lt;/STRONG&gt; stands out as a tax-accounting solution for Brazil. Originally co-innovated with SAP in 2016 and built natively on SAP HANA, Sonda Gallery is designed to support Brazilian tax legislation with high performance and real-time data analysis. Evolving the solution across the time to adopt &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;and integrated with SAP Document and Reporting Compliance (SAP DRC), the solution now features generative AI capabilities, including a virtual assistant trained on product documentation. This assistant helps users navigate the system, summarize notes, translate content, and identify key deliverables—bringing a new level of intelligence to their tax management solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Sonda has been a long time SAP partner and has regularly certified its solutions with &lt;A href="http://sap.com/icc" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration and Certification Center (SAP ICC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;support. Since 2020 Sonda Gallery has been following SAP strategy toward taxes for Brazil and being &lt;EM&gt;SAP Certified&lt;/EM&gt;, initially through an SAP Tax Declaration Framework for Brazil (SAP TDF) scenario, and later through an SAP DRC for Brazil scenario. With the new &lt;A href="https://partnerbenefitscatalog.sap.com/Partner-Benefits-Catalog/Innovation/Certify-Your-Applications-Built-with-SAP-BTP-Utilizing-Generative-AI-Hub-Capabilities-%28BTP-EXT-GenAI%29/p/1001733" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Built with SAP BTP Utilizing Generative AI Hub Capabilities (BTP-EXT-GenAI)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;certification scenario Sonda identified an opportunity to reposition and offer customers with a solution based on SAP BTP and using SAP Business AI, that is now tested against &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/01/a8431b91-117e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Global AI Ethics Policy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;However, the certification criteria did not initially account for Sonda Gallery’s ABAP-based authentication model, which relied on SAP Logon Tickets and classic ABAP objects. Rather than delay the process, SONDA responded with remarkable speed and precision. In just two weeks, the company re-engineered Sonda Gallery’s authentication to fully adopt SAP BTP Cloud Identity services, a modern and secure mechanism native to SAP BTP platform. This migration not only met the certification requirements but also enhanced the solution’s flexibility, to provide enhanced identity and access management (IAM) across both SAP and Microsoft environments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Completing the certification on time was a testament to SONDA’s technical agility and deep understanding of SAP architecture. It also reinforced the company’s commitment to delivering future-ready solutions that meet the highest standards of security, usability, and compliance, tested through &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Certification&lt;/STRONG&gt;. With this achievement, SONDA Gallery is now officially &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Certified with SAP Business AI&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, positioning it as a solution that is taking advantage of the latest technologies provided by SAP for the benefit of our joint customers.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While working on a recent requirement, we needed to deploy a simple React application to the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) Cloud Foundry environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we will share a step-by-step guide to creating a basic React application and deploying it to the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment. This tutorial is beginner-friendly and focuses on setting up an application without authentication, making it an ideal starting point before adding advanced features.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1737031491"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 1: Create a React App&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Creating a new React app using the command:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npx create-react-app myreactapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Mahesh1708_0-1754904817284.png" style="width: 439px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299253i4EC8D22A44329063/image-dimensions/439x280?v=v2" width="439" height="280" role="button" title="Mahesh1708_0-1754904817284.png" alt="Mahesh1708_0-1754904817284.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This will create a folder named '&lt;STRONG&gt;myreactapp&lt;/STRONG&gt;' with all necessary files and configurations for a basic React app.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigating into the project directory using:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd myreactapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1540517986"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 2: Run the React App Locally&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I ran the following command in the project directory to make sure the app was working:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This starts the development server and opens the React app in our default web browser.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Mahesh1708_1-1754904868653.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299254i4F907CF64D1A3D3A/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Mahesh1708_1-1754904868653.png" alt="Mahesh1708_1-1754904868653.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Mahesh1708_2-1754904874720.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299255iB5CD2635D34D2FFC/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Mahesh1708_2-1754904874720.png" alt="Mahesh1708_2-1754904874720.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1344004481"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 3: Build the React App for Production&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To prepare our app for deployment, we create a production build using:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm run build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This command generates a 'build' folder that contains optimized and minified files ready for deployment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Mahesh1708_3-1754904925467.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299256iE0C10CA524122EB1/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Mahesh1708_3-1754904925467.png" alt="Mahesh1708_3-1754904925467.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1147490976"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 4: Create a manifest.yaml File&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Creating a file named 'manifest.yaml' in the project root directory with the following content:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
applications:

build
manifest.yaml
node_modules
package-lock.json
package.json
public
src&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;- `build`: Contains the production-ready version of your app.&lt;BR /&gt;- `manifest.yaml`: Deployment configuration for Cloud Foundry.&lt;BR /&gt;- `node_modules`: Installed project dependencies.&lt;BR /&gt;- `package-lock.json` and `package.json`: Dependency and project metadata.&lt;BR /&gt;- `public`: Static files like `index.html`.&lt;BR /&gt;- `src`: Your React source code.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this tutorial, we covered the entire journey of creating a React application locally, building it for production, and deploying it to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry. We now have a working application accessible from the cloud without any authentication requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;A big part of the magic behind AI, advanced analytics, and {insert tech buzzword here} is the humble API!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I remember the excitement about service-oriented architecture in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Back when most organisations had 'fat' ERPs with extensive customisation, the idea that we could split things up into different apps and connect in a standardised way was refreshing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I recently noticed a &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/sap-codejam-connecting-systems-and-services-using-sap-integration-suite/ec-p/14110686#M848" target="_self"&gt;SAP CodeJam&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the SAP community events calendar that involved connecting systems to S/4HANA using SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I thought it might be fun to build a web app and see if I could successfully connect it to S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A basic understanding of frontend to enterprise backend via cloud architecture is useful for everyone; business experts, technology experts, and people experts&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The article is broken into three parts: an introduction, a step-by-step explanation for generalists, and my build/test notes for anyone working on something similar. The third section includes details on all the test tools, and configuration settings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A couple of quick disclaimers:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I'm not an integration expert:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I don't look at integration suite vs. other solutions&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;I don't cover best practices, typical challenges, good use cases&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;My solution here is likely not optimal:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It's just a vanilla HTML, CSS, JS frontend&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;---&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1608011118"&gt;Part 1: introduction&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1540580332"&gt;From web app to S/4HANA&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300221i6AE07F957A2E6A24/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-1.png" alt="integration-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The plan:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The frontend is a web page to search for data from within S/4HANA&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The web server handles communication between the frontend and SAP Cloud&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Integration Suite will route and format the message for S/4HANA&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;S/4HANA is the source of data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tools/technology:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Utilise the free trial account for SAP BTP and Integration Suite&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Build the frontend and web app ourselves&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We can't access S/4HANA. However, the CodeJam provides a S/4HANA mock server that mimics the behaviour of an API within S/4HANA.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If we use a mock system, we will need to run it locally. So, adjusting the architecture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300223iF83EF9D1F958295D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-2.png" alt="integration-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This adds SAP Cloud Connector which allows an "on-premise" application to connect with SAP Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1344066827"&gt;The front end&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The completed app offers a summary view and a detailed view. Here's a short &lt;A href="https://youtu.be/wNgAwEfLyX0" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;screen recording&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1276636041"&gt;Summary view&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a screenshot from the web browser (firefox).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-3.png" style="width: 986px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300227i15B2BBB969C15471/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-3.png" alt="integration-3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The top part of the page has a search form that allows you to search for a business partner. The bottom part of the page shows the results with a selection of key fields in a card style layout.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock system we are using allows for four different search possibilities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search for a single business partner by number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search for all business partners&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search for a single business partner by number, including address details&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search for all business partners, including address details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1080122536"&gt;Detail view&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300230iFE51F5F8AD6D02A5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-4.png" alt="integration-4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The detail view shows the results in a table. This table has a horizontal scroll bar, which can be adjusted to view all the fields. The table includes 'raw' results, so there are some 'technical' entries like `[object Object]` and some blanks, which I think is fine for this mock up stage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-883609031"&gt;Responsive view&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;For tablets and mobile, the card view resizes with the browser window.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;![the front end - summary view on mobile](/assets/images/blog/integration/integration-5.png)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-5.png" style="width: 364px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300231i01B740227C1E13DC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-5.png" alt="Integration-5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'll come back to how this front end was built after running through the integration flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-558012807"&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The value of this flow is being able to design and build a frontend to access real-time, trusted business data from S/4HANA in a standardised way. In a real-world example, our frontend could be an employee portal or supplier portal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;S/4HANA is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP's enterprise software for large organisations. It handles processes such as purchasing, manufacturing, sales, shipping, finance, etc.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;An evolution from their earlier ERP products (R/1, R/2, R/3, ECC).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A complex platform comprising thousands of programs, tables, and customisations used by many large enterprises.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;S/4HANA already comes with a web frontend called Fiori, which includes thousands of apps. However, in this example imagine we are building something for a casual user that does not require the full capability of Fiori. Or, just consider it's for fun.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further reading on S/4HANA:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[SAP help - S/4HANA](&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE?locale=en-US&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-361499302"&gt;Business partner&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock server simulates one of the business partner APIs for S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A business partner is a reference or master data record that represents a third party that an organisation works with. This includes customers, suppliers, and employees.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business partner master data is organised by key fields such as "category" and "role".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300232iDF2DB3D934F8EECC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-6.png" alt="Integration-6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;All business partners have general data such as name, address, etc., then they have role-specific data, which may include, but are not limited to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Purchasing data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sales data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accounting data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And so on.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To understand how business partner data is used, consider a typical ERP process like order-to-cash:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-7.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300233i882EADCDD4912385/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-7.png" alt="Integration-7.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a summary of the order to cash process. During sales, deliveries, and billing, information from the business partner master record is utilised.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The business partner master stores long-term stable information about the customer. It's used for both reference and validation during transaction entry.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This ensures there is consistency across transactions over time in terms of how they reference business partners. This is critical for reporting. Consider comparability, aggregation, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further reading on business partners:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/74b0b157c81944ffaac6ebc07245b9dc/45653b5856de0846e10000000a441470.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=LATEST" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Help - Business Partner&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-164985797"&gt;S/4HANA Architecture&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock server simulates an S/4HANA API. Let's look inside S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-8.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300236i8B0B2CC5994D164A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-8.png" alt="Integration-8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Starting from the top right, S/4HANA has two primary ways for users to interact. The traditional SAP graphical user interface (GUI) and the modern Fiori web-based user interface.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've drawn APIs to the left of these. The APIs allow applications to interact with S/4HANA.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consider the data model in S/4HANA in two separate parts. The first is the traditional HANA database. This is where master data and transactional data are stored. On top of this is the virtual data model. This consists of core data services views. This is a way to define different sets of data to meet the needs of APIs and Fiori Apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this example, we are using a business partner data API. Behind the scenes, the API sources data from CDS views, which in turn connect to the HANA DB tables.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;---&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--160610427"&gt;Part 2: step by step walkthrough (for everyone)&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this section, I'll summarise the process and technology involved at each step.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-119213144"&gt;Point 1: Web communication&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-map-1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300239i27A3BC33FE94D8D7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-map-1.png" alt="integration-map-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Building an integration flow between web connected applications relies on protocols and standards for web communication. Let's run through the main concepts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--370703368"&gt;Client/server&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The terms client and server are used to describe the requester and receiver. For example, the web browser on a computer is a client, and google search is a server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Internet communications use the HTTP protocol.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;![HTTP communication](/assets/images/blog/integration/integration-10.png)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a standard protocol for communication between clients and web servers. Web pages are written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The term Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to describe an address.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--567216873"&gt;The structure of a URL&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;URLs have five key parts:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Protocol: `http://`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Domain: `&lt;A href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;www.example.com&lt;/A&gt;`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Path: `/pages/`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Query string: `?id=1&amp;amp;cat=test`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fragment: `#article` (an internal page reference, often not present)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;When it comes to APIs, the query string provides the ability to specify parameters for search and filter. In this case, the query string could include a business partner number.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--763730378"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;HTTPS uses the HTTP protocol, but it adds a secure transport layer. HTTPS means the HTTP message is encrypted before transmission.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The only part that isn't encrypted is the domain name.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--960243883"&gt;Internet protocol (IP) address&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;While URLs are designed to be human-readable. An IP is a numerical label like "192.0.2.1" that identifies a computer or network.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;URLs are used for navigation. IPs are used for routing and communication. They identify a specific device on a network (laptop, server, etc.).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;An IP address can be used in place of a domain name with HTTP and HTTPS&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://192.0.2.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://192.0.2.1&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While an IP address represents a computer. The term "port" is used to specific a specific input/output location.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ports are identified using 4 digits.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"http://{server}:{port}"&lt;BR /&gt;"&lt;A href="http://192.0.2.1:1000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://192.0.2.1:1000&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A server is often referred to by 'host'&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"http://{host}:{port}"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can access ports on your own computer by using its IP or "localhost"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:1000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:1000&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1156757388"&gt;From domain to IP&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The web browser uses a domain lookup service to translate a URL into an IP address.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://www.example.com&lt;/A&gt;" becomes "&lt;A href="http://192.0.2.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://192.0.2.1&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is called the Domain Name System (DNS). Popular look up services include: Cloudflare, Google DNS, and OpenDNS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1353270893"&gt;Messages&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The communications themselves can be thought of as messages. They contain a header and a body.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The header includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The URL&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The method, most commonly GET and POST&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;GET sends a request without a body&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;POST sends a request with a body&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additional information on the content type and authorisation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The body includes detailed content. For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If you fill in a form on a web page, it would include the form data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If a server returns a web page, it would include the web page.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1549784398"&gt;Server Responses&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;When a server receives a request, it responds with a status code and a body. Status codes include '200' representing "ok" and '404' representing 'Not Found'.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;(404 has definitely reached meme levels of fame!).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The body that's returned depends on the status and the server's purpose.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1746297903"&gt;Real life examples&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consider visiting the BBC website from a web browser, a simple GET request would return the home page.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-10-1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300240i98D1E11DB146673D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-10-1.png" alt="Integration-10-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the other hand, consider logging into the BBC website. In this case, the browser sends the login name and password. Therefore, a POST request is used, and the request includes a body.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-10-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300241i9C9D28EC27350605/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-10-2.png" alt="Integration-10-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1942811408"&gt;Web connectivity and SAP&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most SAP applications can use HTTPS communication. This is possibly one of the simplest ways we could define "Cloud" strategy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;S/4HANA Cloud Public and S/4HANA Cloud Private can both utilise HTTPS&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP BTP which includes SAP Integration Suite can utilise HTTPS&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Outside the SAP Cloud, we have systems like S/4HANA On-Premise. This is usually at an SAP customer's data centre or their 3rd party hosting service provider's data centre. On premise systems are usually not directly connected to the public internet. This is where SAP provide Cloud Connector to create a secure tunnel between on-premise and SAP Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1971141222"&gt;HTTP data transfer standards&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are further standards as to how data is transferred using HTTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are multiple standards for data transfer with HTTP. One of the earlier and more common standards is REST (Representational State Transfer).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many SAP APIs utilise OData (Open data transfer protocol).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1874251720"&gt;Point 2: S/4HANA business partner API mock server&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-map-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300244i0C0E251EDEC4B8A1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-map-2.png" alt="Integration-map-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mimic the business partner API of an S/4HANA system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is it:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A simple JavaScript server that can be run locally.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock server provided by the SAP community provides a simple way to simulate the design and test of an S/4HANA API.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The mock server mimics the business partner (A2X) API&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This is one of the S/4HANA APIs (programmed inside S/4HANA)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In the case of the mock server, it's a JavaScript server&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The mock server has limited functionality, it supports:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sample data for a few business partners&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retrieve all business partners&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retrieve a single business partner&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Include additional address data in the response.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Installing and running the mock server is simple. The instructions are in part 3. When we run it our computer a local address is returned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On my computer, it runs on "&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the address for the Business Partner API.

Instructions on how to register and set up BTP are included in part 3.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The BTP cockpit is where we can search for and set up different services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It supports multiple infrastructures and runtimes so you can manage/build various types of applications from traditional SAP ABAP to web apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Supports multiple infrastructures/runtimes &amp;amp; languages, including:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cloud Foundry: develop new apps/services, multiple languages, runtimes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP: extend ABAP based products (S/4HANA)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Kyma: Kubernetes to develop/run cloud-native apps&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Neo: HTML5, Java, and HANA extended apps&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;BTP has multiple regions and infrastructure providers&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Regional deployment&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Provided by SAP or Infrastructure-as-a-Provider (IaaS)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The key features of BTP include managing and building:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Compose business processes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Application development and automation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Build and extend SAP applications&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integrate data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Analytics&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Intelligent technologies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Suite utilises the Cloud Foundry environment.

Highly integrated with BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business Accelerator hub is a web resource from SAP. I've drawn it inside BTP as it closely relates to BTP content. It's a central repository for APIs from SAP &amp;amp; selected partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;api.sap.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Main features&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Discover, explore, and test APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Consume integration and workflow content&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Business Partner (A2X) API that is tested here can be viewed on Business Accelerator Hub.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Login to business accelerator hub&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Search 'business partner (A2X)'&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Click on the entry in the results&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-12.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300265iA01898E1E22775A1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-12.png" alt="integration-12.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some features of business accelerator hub:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Try out the APIs (sandbox environment)&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Useful to view a sample of the response&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;View the API capabilities:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;'API Reference' tab, scroll down to 'Business Partner' and click on it&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This shows the list of capabilities of the API&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;View the API specification&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;'Overview' tab, scroll down to 'API Specification' and click on it&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Download OpenAPI JSON&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;View in web browser, text editor to see extensive details&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The API hub is a useful resource in terms of discovering and designing potential API use.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From the mock server specification, we know it's limited to only a few capabilities. We can find the path names for each of these on API hub:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-12-1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300267iB9991B6EA91D1FC9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-12-1.png" alt="Integration-12-1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This confirms the mock server only has a small fraction of the full business partner (A2X) capabilities. This makes sense given how extensive business partner data is in SAP. It's noteworthy that the mock server only supports 'read' activities. We can't test creating or changing a business partner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The details of each of these requests can be viewed by clicking into them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While there are three request paths. The address path can be added to the "all business partners" or "single business partner", so there are four possibilities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All business partners&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"/A_BusinessPartner"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;All business partners with address&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"/A_BusinessPartner/to_BusinessPartnerAddress"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Single business partner&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"/A_BusinessPartner('{BusinessPartner}')"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Single business partner with address&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"/A_BusinessPartner('{BusinessPartner}')/to_BusinessPartnerAddress"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These paths describe services of the API and are appended to the base URL.For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner('{BusinessPartner}')/to_BusinessPartnerAddress" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner('{BusinessPartner}')/to_BusinessPartnerAddress&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The correct terminology for these URLs:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Base URL/host: &lt;A href="http://localhost:3005" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Base path: /sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Entity set: /A_BusinessPartner&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Key Access: ('1234567')&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigation property: /to_BusinessPartnerAddress&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;"('{business partner}')" in the example is a placeholder for a business partner number.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Updating the flow diagram with these details:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-12-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300270i7171352709F09CC3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-12-2.png" alt="Integration-12-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1438148051"&gt;Point 6: SAP Integration Suite&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-map-6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300271i8FBBDE02F7A3CF64/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-map-6.png" alt="Integration-map-6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Design and manage communications between applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is it:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A service of SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Integration Suite is one of the services available in Business Technology Platform.

The S/4HANA business partner mock server is a JavaScript server that runs locally on desktop/laptop and is hence considered 'on-premise' or outside the SAP Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP provides "SAP Cloud Connector" to connect on-premise applications to the SAP Cloud.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's a JavaScript application that can be installed and run locally. Part of the set-up involves entering authentication details from BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After it's set-up, Cloud Connector will accept messages from Integration Suite and forward them to the S/4HANA business partner mock server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The detailed set-up is covered in part 3.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-16.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300295i06526E809FBCA319/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-16.png" alt="Integration-16.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The screenshot above shows the "Cloud to On-Premise" mapping. A virtual host "s4-mock:3006" is mapped to the S4/HANA business partner mock server running locally on "localhost:3005".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Updating the integration flow:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-16-2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300296i574EC1489A20E013/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-16-2.png" alt="Integration-16-2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-230737207"&gt;Point 8: Web app&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-map-8.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300297i052F2A545DBA8042/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-map-8.png" alt="Integration-map-8.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The web app is an application that uses JavaScript as a programming language. Web browsers have JavaScript engines and can run JavaScript code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are two parts to the web app. The frontend and the backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of JavaScript in two categories. frontend JavaScript and server (backend) JavaScript.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--259179305"&gt;Frontend JavaScript&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Runs in the web browser, utilising the browsers JavaScript engine&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is oriented towards manipulating web documents (HTML documents), for example:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Retrieve fields from HTML (e.g. sign up form)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Update HTML (e.g. show results, dynamically add a new page)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The JavaScript engine in the browser has limitations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--455692810"&gt;Server JavaScript&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Installed on a server (can also be run on a desktop/laptop)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A popular engine is Node.js&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Is oriented towards messaging, connectivity, security, authentication&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Has a lot less limitations than the web browser.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;We could try to send a request from the frontend to SAP Integration Suite, but because it comes from a browser, it will likely result in errors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I did try sending a message to Integration Suite from the browser, but received various CORS errors. CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a browser security feature that controls whether a web page on one domain can access resources from a different domain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, the frontend will send a request to the backend, which will then prepare the message and send it as a request to SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's look at the frontend first, then the backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--358803308"&gt;Point 8.1 Web app: frontend&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Purpose:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Search for and display business partner details on a web page.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is it:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A simple web app based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The frontend can be built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;HTML: Used to define the content of the web page&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CSS: Used to apply styles to the web page (layout, colours, font, etc.)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Javascript&amp;amp;colon; Use for programming logic, for example:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get input field values from HTML&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fetch data from the server&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Restructure data for display&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are written in their own files. They are typically in the same folder.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```&lt;BR /&gt;frontend/&lt;BR /&gt;├── index.html&lt;BR /&gt;├── styles.css&lt;BR /&gt;└── script.js&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The HTML file includes references to the 'styles.css' and 'script.js' documents. These can all be written in simple text editors, but applications like 'visual studio code' help with syntax highlighting and formatting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For demo/test these files can simply be kept on a computers hard drive. Or they could be hosted on a static web server like Netlify or GitHub pages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--555316813"&gt;Point 8.2: Web app - HTML&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Web pages are written with HTML, they are hierarchically structured documents where 'tags' are used to denote different types of element which contain content.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a simple illustration, the following would create a web page with a title, a text input field, a submit button and a space for results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the page title&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;form&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;label&amp;gt;Enter business partner number
      &amp;lt;input type="text" /&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;button type="submit"&amp;gt;Submit&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div id="js-results"&amp;gt;
    // Results go here
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This would display:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-17.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300300i9BF0AF4B0E0552B9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-17.png" alt="Integration-17.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A simple element such as paragraph is denoted by&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;`&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;enter paragraph&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A more complex element, an input field is denoted by&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;`&amp;lt;input type="text" /&amp;gt;`&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In this case, `type` is an attribute set to `text` for text field&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1045233325"&gt;Getting HTML to talk to CSS and JavaScript**&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are two attributes that allow them to work together:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"id": for example id="bp-input" (where bp-input is a variable name)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"class": for example class="bp-input" (where bp-input is a variable name)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These attributes can be added to HTML elements to allow us to access those elements with CSS and JavaScript. The difference between the two is a single "id" value is unique and should only be used once in an HTML document, while a class can be applied to multiple HTML elements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The body of the web app frontend is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;header class="header"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class="header-title"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;img class="logo" src="assets/team.png"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class="title"&amp;gt;Employee portal: business partner search&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;nav class="nav"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href="/index.html"&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;article class="bp-article flow"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Search&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class="divider"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;form id="bp-form" class="bp-search"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;label for="bp-inp-number"&amp;gt;Business partner number:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class="text-small"&amp;gt;(Enter 7 digit number or leave blank to return all)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input id="bp-inp-number" class="bp-inp-number" name="bp" type="text" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p id="bp-error" class="bp-error"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class="options"&amp;gt;Options:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input id="bp-inp-address" value="add" type="checkbox" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;label class="text-small" for="bp-inp-address" name="bp-input-address"&amp;gt;Include address details&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input id="bp-inp-tab" value="tab" type="checkbox" /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;label class="text-small" for="bp-inp-tabulate" name="bp-inp-tabulate"&amp;gt;Show results in table&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;button id="js-inp-sub" type="submit"&amp;gt;Submit&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Results&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class="divider"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div id="js-bp-results" class="bp-results"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's not very complex. Most of the complexity is in the CSS styling and the JavaScript programming to return the results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This segregation of content (HTML), styles (CSS), and programming logic (JS) makes working with frontend well structured.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The web app initial HTML includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A header bar with the logo, page name and home link&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A search section with search field options&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;BP number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Checkbox to get address&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Checkbox to show results in detail view&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is how this looks without styling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-18.png" style="width: 824px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300306i6242F0F51B915194/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-18.png" alt="integration-18.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The version with styling was shown at the start of the article.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is the &lt;A href="https://alexroan.com/assets/documents/integration/frontend-html" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;HTML file&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--948343823"&gt;Point 8.3: Web app - CSS&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cascading style sheets (CSS) are used to apply styles to HTML documents. Consider an HTML document with three lines of text:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p id="line-one"&amp;gt;This is text line one&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class="other-lines"&amp;gt;This is text line two&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class="other-lines"&amp;gt;This is text line three&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;These can be styled with CSS as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-css"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#line-one {
color: red;
font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.other-lines {
color: blue;
text-decoration: underline;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This would show:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-19.png" style="width: 472px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300316iF0420D2F7368485B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-19.png" alt="Integration-19.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The complete CSS for the demo/test web app is lengthy. Around 200 lines. Here is a snippet to get an idea of what it looks like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="integration-20.png" style="width: 822px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300317i8B8CC471FF9421E6/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="integration-20.png" alt="integration-20.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CSS is easy to pick up, but challenging to master!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking at the class "bp-search". This applies to the area of the HTML document where the search fields are collected. The CSS here does things like orient those search fields in a column "flex-direction:column" and apply a border and a shadow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is how our page looks with styling.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-21.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300318i0AF0854FE34C5F34/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-21.png" alt="Integration-21.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;Here is the full &lt;A href="https://alexroan.com/asssets/documents/integration/frontend-css.css" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;CSS file&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--976673637"&gt;Point 8.4: Web app - JavaScript&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Frontend JavaScript is able to retrieve, edit and add elements to the HTML document. Writing the JavaScript is possibly the most challenging part of this demo/test, so I'll just summarise what the code does:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Listen for a click of the 'submit' button&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Get the value of the form input elements&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Business partner number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The status of the 'include address details' checkbox&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The status of the 'show results in table' checkbox&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Check the business partner value is valid&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It has to be blank or a 7-digit number&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create a variable object called 'request' to track the request type&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The variable includes:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;request URL&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;request method&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;request body&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;(The ability to track multiple values in an Object is a key JS feature)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Based on the input fields, identify the request type &amp;amp; update the 'request' object.&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The combinations are:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If bp number is blank and get address isn't checked&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If bp number is blank and get address is checked&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If bp number is entered and get address isn't checked&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If bp number is entered and get address is checked.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;At this point, the request object will store a set of values based on the input selections. The values will be one of the four options listed in the earlier tables.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The JavaScript now has what it needs to send a request to SAP Integration Suite.

It's quite different from frontend JavaScript.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The logic of the backend is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Listen for communication from the frontend&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If a message is received:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Do some manipulation of the message related to authorisations&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Using fetch() try sending a request to SAP Integration Suite&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;More authorisation/security handling&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If successful, return the response back to the browser&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;If unsuccessful, log and return the error.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is the backend &lt;A href="https://alexroan.com/assets/documents/integration/backend-javascript.js" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;JavaScript code&lt;/A&gt;. This needs to be set up as part of a Node.js server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The JavaScript server is a bit more complex than the frontend. The server folder contains:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```&lt;BR /&gt;web-app-server/&lt;BR /&gt;├── node_modules/ # created by npm install&lt;BR /&gt;├── package-lock.json # created/updated by npm install&lt;BR /&gt;├── package.json # you write this (or generate with `npm init`)&lt;BR /&gt;└── server.js # your server code&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;server.js contains the actual JavaScript code for the server.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;package.json defines project settings, dependencies, and scripts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;node_modules/ and package-lock.json are automatically generated when dependencies are installed using npm install.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The port can be specified in 'server.js'. I choose port 5000.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This means the server will run on '&lt;A href="http://localhost:5000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:5000&lt;/A&gt;'.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-24.png" style="width: 650px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300322i6AC5E5AE7259389E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-24.png" alt="Integration-24.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After writing package.json and server.js, the following steps are required in terminal to initialise the server, install express, and then start the server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;cd web-app-server&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;npm init -y&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;npm install express&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;node server.js&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can now update the flow diagram with the details for the frontend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration-25.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300323iD986EC04D7C226DD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration-25.png" alt="Integration-25.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1369700647"&gt;One flow, many messages&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking at the diagram, a click on the search button triggers a message that passes through four stages:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From the frontend (browser) to the backend web server&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From the web server to SAP Integration Suite&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From Integration Suite to Cloud Connector&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;From Cloud Connector to the S/4HANA system&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;JavaScript doesn’t normally “wait” for things to happen — it’s designed to keep running while other operations (like network requests) complete in the background.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, the fetch() function is asynchronous, which means it starts a request and immediately returns a kind of “promise” — a placeholder that will eventually be resolved when the response comes back (or if it fails).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When testing this flow, there are multiple layers where errors can occur:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The browser console (frontend logs)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The backend server console (Node.js logs)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integration Suite’s monitoring tools&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The message can fail at any step, and it sometimes takes a bit of detective work to figure out where it failed and why.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If everything works, and S/4HANA returns a successful response (status code 200), that response flows automatically back through the same chain — each layer staying in a “waiting” state until the result is passed back to the frontend and displayed to the user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Don't worry if it's not 100% clear, it took me a while to figure this out.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1566214152"&gt;Conclusions to the walkthrough&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's really fun to build your own frontend and connect it to a real enterprise grade system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A few important considerations:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Precision is needed with the integration configuration:&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Host names, types, routing, transformation are all sensitive to mistakes&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The JavaScript is a little complex, but it is all well established&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A JavaScript and Node.js course and some googling could enable anyone to create this.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Using the S/4HANA business partner mock server is a quick and fun way to test out a potential integration with S/4HANA. However, it is just a mock server with limited features and a build and test with a real S/4HANA system would be required.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, it's easily achievable with a little study and practice and it opens the possibility to develop a wide range of things.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The APIs brings together:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Real-time fast access to a wide range of business data thanks to S/4HANA.&lt;BR /&gt;Extreme flexibility on the frontend side thanks to modern HTML, CSS and JS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This integration could have been much simpler by just having the frontend deliver a URL in the format required for the API. We don't really need the complexity of Integration Suite for this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;---&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1469324650"&gt;Part 3: building the integration flow (for IT people)&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this section I'll share my rough notes from the process of building this front end and integration flow.

Another option is to run it inside a container.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Containers are a key concept in Cloud architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A container packages an app and all it's dependencies together so that it can run independently of the underlying computer (server, laptop, etc.).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a key concept for Cloud as it allows applications to run on different hardware and operating systems with minimal set up effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Docker is a platform to build and manage containers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Docker and container features:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Package an app and all it's dependencies&lt;BR /&gt;- A container is like a lightweight virtual machine&lt;BR /&gt;- Key terms&lt;BR /&gt;- image: blueprint (.zip) containing app, dependencies, and OS&lt;BR /&gt;- container: running instance of an image&lt;BR /&gt;- dockerfile: instructions to build image&lt;BR /&gt;- volume: how to persist data outside the container&lt;BR /&gt;- port mapping: expose internal port to machine (e.g. 8080 to 3001).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'll come back to this in the section on running the BP mock server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1452782612"&gt;Data basics&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following data standards/formats are used in this exercise:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- A lightweight, human-readable format for storing and sharing structured data&lt;BR /&gt;- Looks like nested key-value pairs (like a shopping list with categories)&lt;BR /&gt;- Commonly used in web apps and APIs for sending data between systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```JSON&lt;BR /&gt;{&lt;BR /&gt;"employee_id": "1234567",&lt;BR /&gt;"employee_name": "Alexander"&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;XPATH&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- A query language used to navigate and extract data from XML or HTML documents&lt;BR /&gt;- Lets you point to specific elements using a path-like syntax&lt;BR /&gt;- Example: find the third paragraph inside a section&lt;BR /&gt;- Used in tools like web scrapers and automation scripts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```XPATH&lt;BR /&gt;//title[contains(text(), 'Programming')]&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;XML (eXtensible Markup Language)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- A flexible, tag-based format for representing structured data&lt;BR /&gt;- Similar to HTML in appearance&lt;BR /&gt;- But used for data storage and exchange, not page display.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```XML&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;lt;book id="bk01"&amp;gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;lt;author&amp;gt;Roan, Alexander&amp;lt;/author&amp;gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Front end to S/4HANA&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HTML (HyperText Markup Language)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- The standard language for building web pages and displaying content in browsers&lt;BR /&gt;- Uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images&lt;BR /&gt;- Focused on structure and layout, not data exchange.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1256269107"&gt;Terminal&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;I worked through this demo/test on Mac so I used Terminal, which is the Mac default command line interface (CLI).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The CLI is necessary for activities such as setting up and starting servers or working with docker containers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Terminal basics&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Open a folder `cd &amp;lt;folder name&amp;gt;` (change directory)&lt;BR /&gt;- `cd` on it's own will go to the home directory&lt;BR /&gt;- (Note that `~` represents home directory in terminal)&lt;BR /&gt;- `cd ..` will go up a folder&lt;BR /&gt;- List folders `ls` (list files in the current directory)&lt;BR /&gt;- Open a file `open &amp;lt;file name&amp;gt;` (open a file)&lt;BR /&gt;- Quit sub-screen and return to terminal `q`&lt;BR /&gt;- Stop a running process hold control and c&lt;BR /&gt;- Clear terminal `clear`&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To run JavaScript servers, JavaScript runtime is required. It's easier to install and manage things like this using a package manager in Terminal.

However I'd suggest to start experimenting without the pre-configuration to build a solid understanding of the basics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I'll include more notes in later sections.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1128315290"&gt;Building and testing an integration flow&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-638398778"&gt;Set up the S/4HANA business partner mock server&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Start by setting up the S/4HANA business partner mock server&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Download the mock server from [GitHub](&lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-archive/cloud-s4-sdk-book/tree/mock-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://github.com/SAP-archive/cloud-s4-sdk-book/tree/mock-server&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;BR /&gt;- Scroll down to the readme&lt;BR /&gt;- Either download the archive linked under 'How to run this server'&lt;BR /&gt;- Or if using GitHub clone the repository and checked the branch 'mock-server'&lt;BR /&gt;- Move it to a convenient folder of your choice&lt;BR /&gt;- I set it a `users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/projects/integration/cloud-s4-sdk-book`&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-441885273"&gt;Run the server: option 1: use NPM&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Node.js and the node package manager (NPM) can be used to run the server directly on a computer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Open terminal&lt;BR /&gt;- Navigate to `users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/projects/integration/cloud-s4-sdk-book`&lt;BR /&gt;- (or wherever you saved the folder)&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter: `npm install` (install node package manager in the folder)&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter: `npm start` (start the server)&lt;BR /&gt;- This should return something like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```shell&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;gt; bupa-mock-odata@1.0.0 start&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;gt; node server.js&lt;BR /&gt;Mock server started on port 3000 after 1 ms, running - stop with CTRL+C (or CMD+C)...&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Terminal tells us which port the server is running on. Port "3000" is accesible in the browser or an API client via "&lt;A href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3000&lt;/A&gt;".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To stop the server in terminal use `ctrl+c`.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the curious, you can look at the files that make up the mock server in the above folder. Check out:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- server.js&lt;BR /&gt;- This includes the JavaScript code for the server&lt;BR /&gt;- The code references other files such as app.js&lt;BR /&gt;- package.json&lt;BR /&gt;- This is like a configuration file for a node.js server&lt;BR /&gt;- business partner &amp;gt; business-partner-data.json&lt;BR /&gt;- This contains the demo test business partner data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Theoretically you could use this Node.js server as a template to simulate other SAP Odata APIs with some adjustments to these files.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-245371768"&gt;Run the server: option 2: use Docker&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The mock server can also be run as a Docker container. This is a little more convenient as after the first run we can stop and start it from the Docker desktop app.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note the server already has a Dockerfile, so it's already set up to run as a container.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If we run something inside a docker container we need to interact with it via ports on the container. The application is really running contained inside a container. When we run a docker container we provide a mapping between a local port on the computer and the container port. We can then access the docker application via this mapping.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To run as a Docker container:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Launch the docker app&lt;BR /&gt;- Open terminal&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter `docker run -p 3005:8080 bp-mock-server`&lt;BR /&gt;- 3005 is the local port&lt;BR /&gt;- 8080 is the docker container port&lt;BR /&gt;- Local port can be any free port on your computer. I choose 3005&lt;BR /&gt;- The container port is 8080&lt;BR /&gt;- View the status of the container in the Docker app&lt;BR /&gt;- Use the browser to check `http//localhost:3005`&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note if there wasn't already a dockerfile we would need to create one and build the app before running it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;**A simple docker demo**&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This was my first time using docker, so I experimented by creating a simple "Hello, World!" style server from scratch. Here it is if you want to try:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Create a JS file "index.js"&lt;BR /&gt;- Add `console.log("hello from docker");`&lt;BR /&gt;- This just prints text to the console (Terminal)&lt;BR /&gt;- Create a package file "package.json"&lt;BR /&gt;- Add the following JSON to "package.json"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```json&lt;BR /&gt;{&lt;BR /&gt;"name": "hello-docker",&lt;BR /&gt;"version": "1.0.0",&lt;BR /&gt;"main": "index.js",&lt;BR /&gt;"scripts": {&lt;BR /&gt;"start": "node index.js"&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Create a dockerfile "dockerfile"&lt;BR /&gt;- Add the following to "dockerfile"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```Dockerfile&lt;BR /&gt;FROM node:18&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;WORKDIR /usr/src/app&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;COPY package*.json ./&lt;BR /&gt;RUN npm install&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;COPY . .&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;CMD ["npm", "start"]&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can see Docker uses NPM, in the same way we would with a manual run, but it's installing and running NPM inside the container, not on the computer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To build and run:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Build docker container `docker build -t hello-docker .`&lt;BR /&gt;- Run docker container `docker run hello-docker`&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-342261270"&gt;Testing with the web browser&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The simplest way to test the API is running locally is to put the local address in the web browser.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- For NPM it was "http//localhost:3000"&lt;BR /&gt;- For docker image it was "http//localhost:3005"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The main domain should return the API details including the links such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3000/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3000/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;BR /&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To access the service to return the general data of all business partners we add A_BusinessPartner&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner&lt;/A&gt;"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the browser, this should return a JSON document containing the list of business partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can pick a business partner number from the list and use it with the path to select a specific business partner:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;A href="http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner('1003764" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;http://localhost:3005/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner('1003764&lt;/A&gt;')"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-145747765"&gt;Testing with an API client (Bruno)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rather than just using the web browser to check the API an API client can be used, this has a few benefits:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- We can build the URLs through a selection of 'input fields'&lt;BR /&gt;- We can save different requests for easy and quick re-testing&lt;BR /&gt;- We can pass data in the request body&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To test with Bruno:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Launch Bruno&lt;BR /&gt;- Use the '...' menu to create a collection&lt;BR /&gt;- Name it 'bp-mock'&lt;BR /&gt;- Specify a location.

The way this works is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- We pass a "client id" and "secret" to a "token URL"&lt;BR /&gt;- BTP passes back a "token" which is valid for a certain period of time&lt;BR /&gt;- This "token" has to be attached to any requests to the API in Intelligent Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accessing security details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Navigate to your BTP trial account&lt;BR /&gt;- Expand services and click on 'instances and subscriptions'&lt;BR /&gt;- Scroll down to instances and look for your integration flow instance&lt;BR /&gt;- Integration Suite uses Cloud Foundry so the runtime will be cloud foundry&lt;BR /&gt;- It will likely be named 'default_it-rt_integration-flow'&lt;BR /&gt;- Scroll down to service keys and click on the service key, note the values for:&lt;BR /&gt;- "clientid"&lt;BR /&gt;- "clientsecret"&lt;BR /&gt;- "url"&lt;BR /&gt;- "tokenurl"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For local testing we can hardcode these values in our test tools, but be careful not to upload or share these anywhere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In production, never hardcode secrets or tokens. Use environment variables or a secure credential store.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;**Request a token with Bruno**&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In Bruno create a new request:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Name: `TOKEN`&lt;BR /&gt;- Method: `POST`&lt;BR /&gt;- URL: enter the "tokenurl" from above&lt;BR /&gt;- Navigate to the Params tab:&lt;BR /&gt;- Select 'Add Param'&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter name: `grant_type` path: `client_credentials`&lt;BR /&gt;- Navigate to Auth&lt;BR /&gt;- Switch 'Inherit' to 'Basic Auth' and enter:&lt;BR /&gt;- Username: `client_id`&lt;BR /&gt;- Password: `client_secret`&lt;BR /&gt;- Save&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Send the request. This should return a JSON document with a long value in "access_token". There should also be a expiry time e.g. 4199 seconds.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When sending a request, if the token is not valid Integration Suite will return a 401 error code. This means we need to request a new token.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Within Bruno we can save this token value to a variable. This saves us from copying and pasting it into other requests.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Goto Environments &amp;gt; Configure &amp;gt; Create Environment&lt;BR /&gt;- Name: 'integration-flow'&lt;BR /&gt;- Click '+ Add Variable'&lt;BR /&gt;- Enter name: 'access_token'&lt;BR /&gt;- For value, leave it blank&lt;BR /&gt;- Save and close&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Navigate to 'scripts' under the TOKEN request. Under Post Request enter:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;```JS&lt;BR /&gt;if (res.status == 200) {&lt;BR /&gt;const token = res.body.access_token;&lt;BR /&gt;bru.setEnvVar("access_token",token);&lt;BR /&gt;}&lt;BR /&gt;```&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- If the request receives a response (status 200)&lt;BR /&gt;- Get the access_token value from the response&lt;BR /&gt;- Assign to environment variable "access_token".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Save and run the TOKEN request.&lt;BR /&gt;Goto the environment and click 'configure'.

As this blog post is updated in an irregular fashion, it cannot serve as single point of truth. Please refer to your assigned SAP account/partner manager for most up-to-date information, especially regarding applicable licensing and pricing models.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1581075429"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Introduction&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP ABAP Environment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(aka Steampunk) supports now two options for partners to deliver products to their customers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Partners build side-by-side extensions and deliver them as multitenant software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. This option is considered as a &lt;STRONG&gt;service offering&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;partner is fully responsible for the development and production including the operations of the multitenant SaaS solution. The customers can adapt the mutlitenant SaaS solution to their business using&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;key-user extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;There are also use cases where customers want to operate the partner solution in their own environment or have the need for more comprehensive enhancement of the partner solution using&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;developer extensibility &lt;/STRONG&gt;in addition to key user extensibility&amp;nbsp;to meet the customer business needs. The right way for partners to deliver such products is the newly available software delivery option, called &lt;STRONG&gt;“Add-On Product”&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(first announced as "Installable Product"). It allows partners to provide their solution to customers as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;software offering&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;("Add-On Product") and not as a service. The partner solution offered as software is available for all the customers to whom it was sold by the partner. The customer installs and operates it in his own SAP BTP ABAP Environment systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The market place for partner solutions delivered as an Add-On Product is the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/store.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Store&lt;/A&gt;. A prerequisite to benefit from the new software delivery option is a &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP PE Build contract&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the respective partner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Overview about the two delivery options for commercial partners:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Characteristic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multitenant SaaS Solution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Add-On Product (New Option)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="33px"&gt;Offering type&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="33px"&gt;Service&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="33px"&gt;Software&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Runs in BTP Global Account owned by&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Partner&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Customer&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Operations responsibility&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Partner&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Customer&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Schedule upgrades/patches responsibility&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Partner&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Customer&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Infrastructure costs taken by&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Partner&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Customer&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Extensibility option&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Key-user extensibility&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="33.333333333333336%" height="30px"&gt;Developer extensibility&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Commercial prerequisites&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Contract for productive use&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;SAP PE Build contract with SAP Store enhancement&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Product offering in SAP Store is mandatory&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;No&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Yes&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;A partner can offer the same product as a multitenant SaaS Solution and as an Add-On Product at the same time for different customers. With such a &lt;STRONG&gt;hybrid approach&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a partner can fulfill both, requirements of smaller customers for a standardized service at minimum infrastructure costs and requirements of bigger customers regarding developer extensibility and running the product in the customer's infrastructure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1384561924"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is SAP PE Build?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP offers various partner programs and models. One of these is the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP PartnerEdge program&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The SAP PartnerEdge program has four different tracks, depending on the partner's focus. These tracks are Sell, Build, Service, and Run. To deliver the Add-On Product on the SAP BTP ABAP Environment, the partner requires the SAP PE track &lt;STRONG&gt;"Build".&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Using any other track is not possible.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP PartnerEdge Build program provides SAP partners access to resources, services, and benefits to successfully collaborate with SAP. SAP PartnerEdge – Build is a licensing and GTM model for partners that design, develop, and commercialize applications and software that extend the value of SAP applications. The model features standard terms and fixed revenue share pricing. Partners can publish solutions in the SAP Store, so that customers can consume the products through them. The provision of the Add-On product is only permitted and possible via the SAP Store.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The PE Build Track provides several benefits for the partner.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Onboarding support&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;:&lt;/U&gt; Resources include development and test licenses, advisory and support services, installation and migration guides, and SAP Open Source offerings on GitHub.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Enablement tools&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;:&lt;/U&gt; Help is at hand with support and help portals, how-to guides, developer communities, the SAP Cloud Appliance Library tool, and SAP API Business Hub.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Training resources&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;U&gt;:&lt;/U&gt; You can hone your skills using the openSAP platform, the SAP&amp;nbsp; Enterprise Architecture Explorer site, and SAP Learning Journey guides.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1188048419"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Requirements and Licensing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Partners must meet some requirements to participate in the PE Build Program. These requirements include the following:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Valid due diligence&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Need to agree to the &lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/partnership/development/build.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP PartnerEdge program&lt;/A&gt; agreements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Completion of compliance trainings&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Accounts payable is in good standing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Fulfillment of the compliant partnership requirements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Paying of the annual program fee&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Maintenance of ongoing generic and track-specific program requirements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/partnership/development/sap-app-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Prerequisites for publishing on SAP store&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The respective prices for a partner vary because they depend on the BTP services used, the revenue share, and the annual fee. You can find more information about pricing, revenue share and annual contributions &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;here&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

This is why customers and partners have to buy at least 1 unit of 16 GB runtime and 2 units of 16 GB persistence in order to get started.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Furthermore, the partner also needs authorization to make their own software available via the SAP Store.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Any partner selling a GTM-ready solution must adhere to paying a revenue share to SAP according to the price list for the Build track of the SAP PartnerEdge program, regardless of whether SAP facilitated the customer transaction (for example, through an SAP sales representative) or not.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-991534914"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How does the partner provide the Add-On Product?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The approach for developing and building an Add-On Product is the same as for the&amp;nbsp;multitenancy SaaS product.&amp;nbsp;The partner development is done via the BTP Global Account and then the Landscape Portal is used to build the product based on the developed custom software component(s).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From then on, the process differs from that of the multitenancy SaaS product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The partner registers the Add-On Product in the SAP Solution Hub and maintains all necessary data for provision in the SAP Store.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;The partner is getting access to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Solution Hub via the mandatory SAP&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;PE&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Build contract. In the final step, the partner publishes the product in the Landscape Portal.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Optionally the partner can certify the Add-On Product to assure a defined level of quality and compatibility which is visible in the SAP Store. Please&amp;nbsp;check out the &lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/partnership/development/certify_software.html?#section-1-accordion-panel-section-widewidgets-accordionitem_copy_8" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Integration and Certification Center&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;to find out which certificate fits to your needs and how the certification process looks like.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-795021409"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What does the customer need to do?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The customer needs to select the product from the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/store.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Store&lt;/A&gt; and needs to contact the partner via the respective form in the SAP Store. After selling the product by the partner to the customer, a signed &lt;STRONG&gt;Amendment to SAP Business Technology Platform Supplemental Terms and Conditions&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;for ABAP Add-ons&lt;/STRONG&gt; is required of the customer. This amendment is automatically part of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform Supplemental Terms and Conditions&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;for new BTP contracts and renewed BTP contracts with signed date &lt;STRONG&gt;on April 23, 2025 or later&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This is also true for all SAP Build contracts.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For customer BTP contracts signed &lt;STRONG&gt;before&amp;nbsp;April 23, 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the customer (or the partner on behalf of the customer) need to create a customer ticket for component &lt;STRONG&gt;BC-CP-ABA&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This customer ticket represents a service request for SAP to initiate a DocuSign process that the customer signs the required above-mentioned amendment. Please specify in the ticket:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Purpose: Sign amendment for ABAP Add-ons&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customer name and ID (if the ticket was created by the partner on behalf of the customer)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Contact email address on customer side who will be the recipient for the DocuSign process&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The amendment needs to be signed only once per customer and is independent of the vendor of the product to be installed. The customer can only see the product in the Landscape Portal if the amendment is signed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The customer is responsible to install the product and to trigger the installation of both upgrades and patches provided by the partner. After the initiated purchasing process via SAP Store, all these lifecycle activities are supported by the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/landscape-portal/landscape-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Landscape Portal&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;. The Landscape Portal is part of the SAP BTP ABAP Environment and does not cause additional costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-598507904"&gt;Further information:&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you want to apply for the SAP PartnerEdge Build program, please &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;use the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://sappartneredgeapplication.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/?partnerType=BLD" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;online application form&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;or refer to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Partner Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can find more technical information about the Add-On Product&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the documentation of the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-abap-environment/landscape-portal/landscape-portal" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Landscape Portal&lt;/A&gt;, applications for product lifecycle management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the recording of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxb8NSAS9Vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Devtoberfest Session: Building Partner Products on SAP BTP ABAP Environment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1737744677"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introduction&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As AI-generated content becomes deeply integrated into enterprise workflows, ensuring authenticity, traceability, and compliance is more critical than ever. AI-generated documents, reports, media files, and communication content are increasingly driving decisions, automation, and customer interactions. As a result, organizations are no longer just creating content—they're responsible for governing it across its entire lifecycle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watermarking—once a niche solution primarily used for digital rights management—is now emerging as a key enabler of AI content governance. By embedding information directly into content files—such as their creation source, generation method, AI model, or associated policy metadata—watermarks help ensure that AI outputs are verifiable, policy-aware, and audit-ready.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we explore the role of watermarking in enabling AI compliance, supporting lifecycle management, and building trusted AI content ecosystems at scale. We will cover the current challenges enterprises face, how watermarking works, and what’s needed for watermarking to evolve with generative AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1541231172"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Compliance by Design: A Necessity for Watermarking AI-Generated Content&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI-generated content is increasingly subject to regulatory and corporate governance. Legal frameworks such as the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;EU AI Act&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB942" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;California AI Transparency Act&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/ai-labeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;China Measures for Labeling of AI-Generated Synthetic Content&lt;/A&gt; and GDPR, alongside internal audit and information governance policies, now require that content produced by AI be:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Explicitly labelled as AI-generated&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Traceable to its source&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Managed in line with legal retention policies&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Auditable for integrity and responsible use&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond legal compliance, enterprises must ensure that AI-generated content can be classified, archived, audited, and ultimately destroyed based on business rules. This is where information lifecycle management (ILM) comes in. From creation to retention, archiving to deletion, each stage of content use must be policy-driven and secure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Jiayu_Wang_0-1755138791801.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300588iB7B1F269181C0876/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Jiayu_Wang_0-1755138791801.png" alt="Jiayu_Wang_0-1755138791801.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditional metadata alone is not sufficient to meet these goals—metadata can be stripped or altered. Watermarking offers a more durable, embedded approach to ensure content governance is inherently built into the content itself.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1344717667"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What Is Watermarking&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watermarking is the process of embedding additional information—either visible or invisible—into digital content. This information can be extracted later to verify origin, track usage, or enforce compliance. Watermarks can include model identifiers, timestamps, legal classifications, or lifecycle metadata.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1277286881"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Methods of Watermarking&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watermarks can be embedded in various ways depending on the content type:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Jiayu_Wang_1-1755138791801.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300590i9D3A9D80B2B69000/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Jiayu_Wang_1-1755138791801.png" alt="Jiayu_Wang_1-1755138791801.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Images: Frequency‑domain methods such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and matrix‑factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) enable imperceptible watermark embedding while preserving visual fidelity.&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Jiayu_Wang_2-1755138791801.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300589i7B527BF337441632/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Jiayu_Wang_2-1755138791801.png" alt="Jiayu_Wang_2-1755138791801.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Jiayu_Wang_3-1755138791801.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300591i6A95D89243E094EA/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Jiayu_Wang_3-1755138791801.png" alt="Jiayu_Wang_3-1755138791801.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Videos: Frame-based watermarks allow tracking across transformations and streaming.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Text: Emerging techniques embed watermarks in AI‑generated text by manipulating token‑selection patterns or introducing subtle semantic perturbations that remain imperceptible to readers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Audio: Watermarks can be applied in the frequency or time domain (e.g., using spread spectrum or echo hiding techniques), allowing resilient tracking through compression, filtering, and re-recording.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;PDF files: Watermarks can be embedded in content streams or structure elements without altering visual layout.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tabular data: In structured data such as CSV or Excel files, watermarking can be applied by subtly modifying statistical properties or introducing pattern-based noise within numerical precision thresholds—enabling detection without compromising data utility.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1080773376"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Categories of watermarking&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watermarks can be categorized in two main ways:&lt;STRONG&gt; visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt; and&lt;STRONG&gt; resilience to&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;manipulation&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;1. By Visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Visible watermarks: Logos, seals, or text overlays that indicate ownership or status.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Invisible watermarks: Algorithmically embedded data that is imperceptible to the human eye but can be detected programmatically.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2. By Resilience to Manipulation&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Robust watermarks: Designed to survive edits like cropping, compression, scaling, or format changes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fragile watermarks: Easily removed when content is altered, useful for detecting tampering or unauthorized modification.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Jiayu_Wang_4-1755138791801.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300592i2ADFB7A3D677100D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Jiayu_Wang_4-1755138791801.png" alt="Jiayu_Wang_4-1755138791801.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-884259871"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Watermarks &amp;amp; Metadata&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;While both watermarking and metadata aim to enrich digital files with useful context, they serve different purposes and come with unique trade-offs. &lt;STRONG&gt;Metadata&lt;/STRONG&gt; is easily accessible and widely supported across systems, making it ideal for fast retrieval, tagging, and classification. However, it can be removed, altered, or lost during file transfers, format conversions, or malicious tampering.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On the other hand, &lt;STRONG&gt;watermarking&lt;/STRONG&gt; embeds information directly into the content itself—making it more persistent and tamper-resistant. It remains intact even if a file is renamed, copied, or stripped of its metadata.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Used together, they form a powerful combination:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Metadata enables automation and policy-driven governance,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Watermarks provide long-term traceability and authenticity—even across systems.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-558663647"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-362150142"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-165636637"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Applications of AI Watermarking&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watermarking serves a wide range of compliance and security functions in the context of AI. It enables enterprises to embed critical information at the moment of content generation and retrieve it later to verify its legitimacy, origin, and policy alignment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-98205851"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Content Provenance and Authentication&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most impactful applications is &lt;STRONG&gt;authenticity verification&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Watermarks can confirm whether a piece of content—image, document, or video—was generated by AI, when it was created, and under what policy. This is essential for trust and transparency, especially in regulated industries or public-facing communications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watermarks are also crucial for verifying the authenticity and ownership of digital artworks, particularly in NFTs, protecting intellectual property. They can be also used to verify the integrity of legal, financial, and HR documents, ensuring compliance and audit trail reliability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--173539023"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Watermarking for Lifecycle Governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond detection, watermarks help enforce &lt;STRONG&gt;Information Lifecycle Management (ILM)&lt;/STRONG&gt; policies automatically. At each stage of a file's life, watermarks enable smart, compliant handling:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Creation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Embed watermarks at the point of generation to record the origin and purpose.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Retention&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Encode legal tags or policy rules to guide how long a file must be kept.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Audit&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Watermarks track changes and access history, supporting audit trails.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Archiving&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Even in long-term storage, watermarks preserve authenticity and ownership.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Destruction&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Watermarks indicate when deletion is permitted and record that action as proof of compliance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--76649521"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Strategic Importance of Watermarking&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watermarking is more than a technical solution—it’s a strategic enabler for enterprise-grade AI governance. As organizations generate increasing volumes of AI content, ensuring &lt;STRONG&gt;responsibility, auditability, and control&lt;/STRONG&gt; becomes essential. Invisible watermarking provides the foundation for this shift, turning untraceable content into &lt;STRONG&gt;self-describing, policy-aware assets&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From a business perspective, watermarking brings several key advantages:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Proactive Compliance with AI Regulations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Watermarks help enterprises meet emerging legal requirements, such as those outlined in the EU AI Act, by embedding model identity, generation source, and disclosure metadata directly into files. This enables content-level traceability and accountability at scale.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced Data Integrity and Auditability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Embedded watermarks offer a tamper-resistant record of content origin, usage policy, and lifecycle events—supporting internal audits, external reporting, and security reviews.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Seamless Integration with SAP ILM and IRM Workflows&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Watermarking aligns naturally with SAP's Information Lifecycle Management and Information Retention Manager systems. It enables automated decision-making for retention, archiving, or deletion based on metadata embedded at the time of creation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Metadata-Driven File Classification and Governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Watermarked content can carry its own classification, such as document type or sensitivity level, enabling intelligent automation of compliance actions without relying solely on external metadata or manual tagging.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Self-Aware Content for Smarter Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Perhaps most importantly, watermarking empowers content to become &lt;STRONG&gt;self-aware&lt;/STRONG&gt;—capable of communicating its own identity, rules, and restrictions. This makes it possible to build more adaptive, intelligent document governance systems that respond in real time to compliance needs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In short, watermarking transforms AI-generated content from a potential risk into a managed, compliant, and trustworthy asset—one that supports both operational efficiency and long-term governance goals.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--273163026"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--469676531"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Outlook: The Evolution of Watermarking in the Generative AI Era&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As generative AI continues to advance, watermarking must evolve to meet the growing demands of scale, robustness, and interoperability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scalability&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Future watermarking systems must support high-volume content generation and real-time applications such as streaming media and cloud-native pipelines.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Robustness&lt;/STRONG&gt;: As AI-generated content proliferates, watermarks must be resilient against a wide range of manipulations — from basic operations like compression, cropping, and format conversion, to more advanced challenges such as screenshots and adversarial attacks. Crucially, they must remain detectable across diverse content types and evolving AI output formats.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standards and Interoperability&lt;/STRONG&gt;: One major challenge is the lack of unified, industry-wide standards. To address this, the adoption of open standards like &lt;STRONG&gt;C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity)&lt;/STRONG&gt; is critical. Open-source solutions such as &lt;STRONG&gt;Meta’s VideoSeal&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;DeepMind’s SynthID for text/image watermarking&lt;/STRONG&gt; are also paving the way for broader adoption and transparency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In short, watermarking must become &lt;STRONG&gt;more intelligent, resilient, and standardized&lt;/STRONG&gt; to remain a trusted foundation for AI content governance across industries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--666190036"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Conclusion: Authenticity Matters in the Age of AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As AI becomes a core part of enterprise systems, the ability to verify, trace, and govern content becomes essential. Watermarking provides a foundational layer of trust—ensuring that content is not only intelligent, but also accountable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the era of generative AI, authenticity is not optional—it’s a requirement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;[References]&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://c2pa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://c2pa.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/topics/information-lifecycle-management" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/topics/information-lifecycle-management&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.4735" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.4735&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15435" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15435&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09492" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09492&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05891" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05891&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09712" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09712&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
