    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Unlocking agility with SAP BTP Platform capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think about the last time your business was under pressure. Maybe a critical system went down, a compliance audit was looming, or your teams were scrambling to connect data across multiple environments. In those moments, it’s not just technology that’s on the line, its customer trust, revenue, and reputation. For leaders, the stakes couldn’t be higher: every second of downtime or data risk ripples directly into the business.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This is exactly the kind of pressure Jeff faces every day.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Jeff is the IT operations lead at a U.S. logistics company. His team just deployed a new shipment tracking app in their West Coast cloud data center. The rollout goes well customers will receive real-time updates, and leadership is excited. But only a week later, the business calls with a new demand: “We need this live on the East Coast immediately.” That means a different region, new compliance requirements, and an entirely different setup. For most IT teams, this would mean long nights, rushing to reconfigure systems, and hoping nothing breaks in the process.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Jeff feels the pressure, but he doesn’t panic. His IT stack is running on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP&lt;SPAN&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt;. Deployments can be transported and monitored easily. Security and compliance are handled within the platform, not bolted on after the fact. Connections across environments are already streamlined, and performance scales as demand grows. By the end of the week, the app is live across the country. Customers get the same seamless experience, the business captures new opportunities, and Jeff’s team avoids chaos.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Jeff’s story isn’t unique. This is the reality for enterprises everywhere: running mission-critical workloads, managing enterprise applications, and orchestrating complex business processes has never been more challenging. Complexity is no longer just an IT problem-it’s a business risk.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html#:~:text=Over%2033%2C000%20customers%20are%20succeeding%20with%20SAP%20Business%20Technology%20Platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;See how other customers are transforming their operations, securing their landscapes, and scaling innovation with SAP BTP.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Rising complexity &amp;amp; market demands&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Business and technology leaders today face:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rising complexity from fragmented, multi-vendor landscapes&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;95% of organizations struggle with system integration (&lt;A href="https://www.adalo.com/posts/integration-challenges-with-legacy-technologies-b2b-stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Adalo,2025&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Escalating cybersecurity threats&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;38% of global cyberattacks rose in 2022 (&lt;A href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/02/08/2604259/0/en/Check-Point-Software-Releases-its-2023-Security-Report-Highlighting-Rise-in-Cyberattacks-and-Disruptive-Malware.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Check Point Research, 2023&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Outdated systems&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;62% of leaders noted overburdened legacy models cannot support current and future strategic objectives and plans (&lt;A href="https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/cio-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Gartner, 2025&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Pressure to innovate faster while controlling costs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;80% of organizations say outdated tech is holding back innovation (&lt;A href="https://services.global.ntt/en-us/newsroom/80-percent-of-organizations-agree-that-inadequate-or-outdated-technology-is-holding-back-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;NTT Global Research, 2024&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Without a cohesive approach, enterprises risk losing the very agility they need to stay competitive. Meeting these demands takes more than infrastructure-it takes a platform that unifies the essential capabilities enterprises depend on: Application lifecycle management, Security, Interoperability, and Administration &amp;amp; Operations. Together, these keep core systems consistent and reliable while enabling flexibility to adapt and innovate at scale.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Capabilities Every Enterprise Needs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To address these challenges, enterprises need a platform. Let's define its core capabilities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application Lifecycle Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Keep business applications consistent, reliable, and up to date across their entire lifecycle.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security &lt;/STRONG&gt;- Safeguard data, systems, and users with enterprise-grade protection and compliance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Interoperability&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Seamlessly connect processes, applications, and data across hybrid, multi-cloud, and heterogeneous landscapes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Administration &amp;amp; Operations&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Ensure resilient, efficient, and scalable operations across regions and environments.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These capabilities don’t just keep the lights on-they empower enterprises to adapt and innovate with confidence. Interviewed SAP customers described their specific considerations in choosing SAP BTP: strength of analytics, integration, and automation (SAP SuccessFactors): “We chose SAP BTP because it offers comprehensive data analytics, integration, and automation capabilities. It provides a 360-degree view of our systems and applications.” (&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html?pdf-asset=5cb3ae0b-167f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&amp;amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Business Value Report. 2025&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why SAP BTP Is Different&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unlike fragmented, multi-vendor approaches, SAP BTP delivers these capabilities as part of a unified platform. With BTP, organizations can manage and evolve applications seamlessly across their entire lifecycle, protect data and systems with built-in enterprise-grade security, and connect processes and data end to end without silos. At the same time, they can keep operations reliable and consistent across regions and environments. This cohesive layer enables enterprises to move beyond patchwork solutions and gain the confidence to standardize, secure, and scale their business without compromise-with IDC research showing a 516% three-year ROI from SAP BTP &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html?pdf-asset=5cb3ae0b-167f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&amp;amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;(SAP Business Value Report, 2025).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/A&gt;Powered by application lifecycle management, security, interoperability, and administration &amp;amp; operations, SAP BTP provides a consistent, protected, and reliable way to run across regions and environments. This is what makes the promises of Build, Integration, and AI real to accelerate application development, connect SAP and non-SAP systems seamlessly, and embed AI into business processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Let’s bring to into focus&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Application Lifecycle Management &lt;/STRONG&gt;- Keep pace with change&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Businesses never stand still, and applications can’t either. Application Lifecycle Management streamlines how teams build, test, and release, shrinking development cycles from months to weeks, so apps evolve at the pace to meet growing business demands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Security&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Protect what matters most&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With escalating threats and tighter regulations, security cannot be an afterthought. SAP BTP embeds identity, access, and compliance into the platform itself, protecting sensitive data and transactions so enterprises can innovate with trust.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Interoperability&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Connect everything, everywhere&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enterprises run on a mix of SAP, non-SAP, and multi-cloud systems. By removing integration barriers, SAP BTP ensures seamless data and process flow, reducing complexity and enabling rapid adaptation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Administration &amp;amp; Operations &lt;/STRONG&gt;- Run reliably at scale&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Innovation only thrives when operations are stable. Real-time visibility helps IT teams optimize performance, control costs, and ensure mission-critical workloads run reliably across regions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Turning capabilities into outcomes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP BTP isn’t just a platform-it’s a set of capabilities that help you run with confidence today and prepare for whatever comes next. By unifying what matters most, it ensures your business stays secure, connected, and ready to grow. Customers echo this value, saying: “We chose SAP BTP because it offers comprehensive data analytics, integration, and automation capabilities. It provides a 360-degree view of our systems and applications”.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction to Business Data Cloud:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP Business Data Cloud was introduced on&amp;nbsp;February 13 2025 as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution fully managed by SAP.&amp;nbsp;SAP Business Data Cloud is a data &amp;amp; analytics platform that harmonizes all data from SAP and non-SAP sources into a unified semantic layer of trusted data that governs, connects and share data securely across systems or cloud. By integrating&amp;nbsp;powerful functionality of SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud, and SAP Databricks and&amp;nbsp;SAP Business Warehouse.&amp;nbsp;It empowers businesses to break data silos to power advanced AI and&amp;nbsp;analytics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why was Business data cloud introduced?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;easier&amp;nbsp;access to SAP data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;without the need for complex data preparation steps such as extraction, building semantics, transformation and loading data for analytics.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&lt;STRONG&gt; access to&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;SAP data from all Line of Business (LoB)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;applications, such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Ariba without the need of 3rd party connector &amp;amp; tool.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;a unified&amp;nbsp;business view&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the data regardless of which SAP application it originated from without making harmonization difficult and holds its&amp;nbsp;original business context without any change.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;accelerate AI with trusted and secure&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;that they can use to build reliable AI applications to accelerate innovation and insights with AI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;faster access to&amp;nbsp;SAP data insights&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;by removing data preparation and dashboard building steps.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;a Simplified Landscape&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;by reducing multiple tools, silos and complex tasks of manual data preparation, development and analytics.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Features &amp;amp;

In this way the CAP service can work as an embedded vector database .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-714559139"&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Phase&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;To this point, we've prepared the application's data infrastructure, loaded the products into the system, converted them to embedding (numeric vector) format, and established a structure capable of vector searching on SQLite. Now, we're moving on to the real intelligence: the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) process.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;The primary goal of the RAG approach is to prevent AI from relying solely on the model it was trained on and to enable it to produce more accurate, reliable, and contextual results by accessing real data. In this project, we implemented this as follows:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;When a user types a stock-related query in natural language, the system first embeds the query and identifies the most relevant SKUs by performing a vector similarity search on SQLite-Vec. The actual records for these products are then retrieved from the SAP CAP database and provided as grounding for the Gemini model. This ensures that the AI ​​generates its response based solely on existing product data, eliminating any hallucinations.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;R — Retrieval (Finding information):&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;The query from the user ( ) queryis converted into an embedding and this embedding finds similar products using SQLite-Vec:

const qvec = await embed(query);
if (!qvec.length)
  return { error: "Embedding üretilemedi (Gemini).", products: [] };


const buf = toFloat32Buffer(qvec);
rows = db
  .prepare(`
    SELECT sku, vec_distance_cos(embedding, ?) AS dist
    FROM vec_product_vectors
    ORDER BY dist ASC
    LIMIT 5
  `)
  .all(buf);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this phase, the system translates the user's natural language query into a numerical vector and returns the closest product placements based on vector similarity (cosine distance). In other words, this is where the "finding related information"&lt;BR /&gt;step occurs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-518045634"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;A — Augmentation (Adding contextual data)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;Actual product records&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt; are pulled from the CAP database using the found SKUs &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const skus = rows.map((r) =&amp;gt; r.sku);
const products = await cds.run`
  SELECT *
  FROM data.Products
  WHERE sku in ${skus}
`;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;At this point:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;Actual commercial data (product name, price, stock, category, etc.) are taken from the system.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;The model is now prepared to produce answers with only this data.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;In other words , &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;the Retrieval result &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;is strengthened with real information&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt; by being “Augmented” &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-321532129"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;Generation (Answer generation)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;The model generates an answer based solely on the above data with the grounding rule:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const prompt = `Kullanıcı: "${query}"

Blogs&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;可能有更多你需要的内容&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;想象一下：当其他公司还在为系统升级而头疼，数周甚至数月测试自定义代码时，你的企业却能在几天内完成&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;系统升级，快速获得最新功能和&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;能力。这不是幻想，而是&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clean Core&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;方法带来的现实改变。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1568109348"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clean Core是什么？&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clean Core是&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;推出的一套系统架构方法论，细分了五个维度的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clean, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;分别是业务流程，功能拓展，数据，集成，运维。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;本文更多关注功能拓展方面的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clean Core&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;，通过将自开发代码与&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;标准代码解耦，确保企业能低成本的满足个性化需求，同时还能获得持续创新。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;需要提前明确的是，除了体外平台，SAP还提供了“清洁的”体内部署方式，也就是说，“体内开发”不等于“不清洁”，但体外开发是天然清洁的。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371595843"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP为什么要推出Clean Core？&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;发现企业在定制化&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;应用时，如果大量在应用体内做修改，将面临诸多挑战：&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;企业自主开发成本上升：定制化代码越多，进一步定制导致的风险，开发&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;测试成本就会越高&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;难以实施系统更新&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;标准升级包可能与定制化代码不兼容&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;难以引入原厂开发的新功能：例如&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;的嵌入式&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;功能&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;应用自开发过多导致运行缓慢&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;同时，开源技术在一些场景下可以提供比&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ABAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;更好的体验，例如移动应用，工作流与&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;RPA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;需求。所以&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;选择引入新技术，为&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;应用的定制化提供新方式，给到用户更多选择。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175082338"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;用户如何衡量应用是否符合Clean Core标准呢？&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1107651552"&gt;一个未经修改的应用，清洁程度将会是百分之百，而实施过程中每个新拓展都可能影响到清洁程度，所以一般从单个拓展的清洁程度来看这个问题。&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP采用A-D四个等级来衡量单个扩展的清洁程度：&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;D&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;级（最不清洁）：在内部直接修改了标准表&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;程序&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;类&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;函数；或是使用了“不推荐”的对象和模式。可以在云化存储库（&lt;A href="https://sap.github.io/abap-atc-cr-cv-s4hc/?version=objectClassifications_SAP.json&amp;amp;states=classicAPI）" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://sap.github.io/abap-atc-cr-cv-s4hc/?version=objectClassifications_SAP.json&amp;amp;states=classicAPI）&lt;/A&gt;中查看&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;状态。&lt;/SPAN&gt;此外，等级D还包括了不鼓励的开发技术，比如隐式增强implicit enhancements。&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;C&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;级：在内部开发的新功能中使用了未被&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;公开发布的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;，但没有修改标准功能&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;B&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;级：在新功能中仅使用了&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;发布且标注为&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Classic&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;或&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Released&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;，包括&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BAPI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;，&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ALV Grid&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;，&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BAdI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;等内部开发技术都可划分在此类&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;级（最清洁）：没有内部修改，仅通过标准的对外接口，对接搭载于&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP build&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;拓展套件。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;总的来说，清洁程度由低到高的判断标准大致为：&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;是否修改了标准功能&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;是否调用了不推荐的标准&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;定制功能是否部署在体外&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;但从实践来看，&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;级和&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;B&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;级拓展都是清洁的，S/4HANA中还提供了天然清洁的B级拓展工具。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-782055328"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;用户应该如何达成Clean Core呢？&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;首先需要明确的是，尽管&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clean Core&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;理论认为，拓展应该尽可能的由应用外的核心来承接，但实际业务需求导致部分拓展仍旧需要保留在体内，所以一切决策都应该由实际出发，综合考虑&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ROI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-714624542"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1.现状了解&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;首先需要了解&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;应用中现在的拓展数量（包括接口、逻辑、界面、数据、报表等）&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;依据开发习惯初步猜测可能的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;D&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;级拓展数量。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-518111037"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.未来规划&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;依据现状和未来的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;IT&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;规划，决定大体的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clean Core&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;目标，例如将&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;10000&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;个拓展在&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;年内缩减至&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5000&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;个，将&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1000&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;个&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;D&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;级拓展在&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;年内全部消除等。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-321597532"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3.可行路径调研&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;深入了解&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;针对&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;S/4HANA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;提供的各种拓展手段，包括传统的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP GUI SE80, Fiori&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;界面下的Custom Fields and Logic等天然清洁的拓展工具，&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BTP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;上&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Build&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;拓展套件的高代码开发&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;低代码&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;App&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;开发，工作流&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;RPA&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;开发和门户开发等&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-125084027"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4.制定属于企业自己的开发原则&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;一般以决策树方式呈现，将需求引导至合适的实现方式，一般首先根据可行性判断是否体外开发（例如是否需要对接外部用户&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;系统），然后根据需求类别选择拓展方式（例如接口类需求一般统一采用集成套件承接）&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--146660847"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5.新旧分流&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;对于新需求一律采用新原则来决定开发方式，在有余力的时候逐步将旧拓展基于新原则进行迁移，优先考虑&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;D&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;级拓展。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--343174352"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6.定期总结和滚动计划&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;以上流程不仅仅是一次拓展代码的技术升级，更关键的是，迁移过程中企业可以大量采用新技术，以提升性能，体验（把功能做的更好），甚至是基于新技术完全重构拓展（做以前做不到的功能）&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;例如结合&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;技术识别纸质文档，判断客户付款风险等等&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;同时，SAP还提供了大量工具来帮助用户实现Clean Core, 包括可以在体内实现清洁拓展的开发工具和对现有拓展的代码分析工具等。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--246284850"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;为什么过去没有Clean Core概念呢？&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;过去&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;系统主要基于本地部署，系统升级周期长，企业更关注快速实现业务需求而非长期可维护性。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;传统&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ABAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;开发模式允许直接修改&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;标准代码，缺乏有效的解耦机制和治理工具。随着云计算兴起和企业对敏捷性要求提高，&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;意识到需要新的架构方法来平衡定制化需求与持续创新能力。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2

ABAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;最新的开发模式，不是一款产品。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;而传统的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ABAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;开发模式叫做Classic ABAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;几个核心区别：&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ABAP Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;仅支持通过 ABAP development tools for Eclipse这个写代码的工具&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;来开发；&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;仅支持通过&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;CDS&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;访问数据，禁止直接表访问；&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;仅允许使用已发布的&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;这些技术限制并非为了制造障碍，而是通过使用稳定&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;和预留增强点，获取更强的兼容性和升级稳定性，保证了核心的清洁&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-389052412"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;总结&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;看似严格的技术限制，实际上是为开发者铺设了一条通往长期成功的道路——当你被迫使用稳定的API和标准化的开发模式时，你的应用将自动获得更强的兼容性和升级保护。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;正如建筑师必须遵循结构工程的规范才能建造出安全持久的建筑一样，ABAP Cloud的约束让开发者在规范的框架内获得真正的自由：从技术债务中解脱，专注于业务价值创造。&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;关于本文内容有任何问题或见解，欢迎在评论区留下你的想法&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Authors:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/7024"&gt;@amagnani37&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/16662"&gt;@merza&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thank you to everyone who joined our recent partner webinar, &lt;STRONG&gt;"Streamline document processing with SAP Document AI"&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This session was part of our ongoing partner webinar series, "&lt;A href="https://url.sap/crvdej" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Talk to your business with Generative AI&lt;/A&gt;", and the turnout and engagement were fantastic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For those who couldn't make it, or for anyone who wants a recap, we—&lt;STRONG&gt;Merza Klaghstan&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Alice Magnani&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;Jacob Tan&lt;/STRONG&gt; from the BTP &amp;amp; AI Solution Architects team —wanted to share the key takeaways, demos, and technical insights from the session.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our goal was to go beyond a simple feature list and show you how SAP Document AI can be the centerpiece of a complete, end-to-end business solution.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s what we covered.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1635565066"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Part 1: What is SAP Document AI and Why Does it Matter?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;We kicked off by tackling the core business problem: a staggering &lt;STRONG&gt;70-80% of all enterprise information is unstructured&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Manually processing this data from documents, emails, and scans is not only slow but also expensive and prone to errors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Document AI, formerly known as Document Information Extraction (DOX), is SAP's AI-powered solution on the Business Technology Platform (BTP) designed to solve this. It goes far beyond simple Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to &lt;STRONG&gt;extract, classify, and validate data&lt;/STRONG&gt; with high precision.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1568134280"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We highlighted several key features:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multiple Editions:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The service is available in &lt;STRONG&gt;Base AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Premium AI&lt;/STRONG&gt; (which includes Generative AI capabilities), and &lt;STRONG&gt;Embedded&lt;/STRONG&gt; editions to fit different use cases. We also want to highlight for our &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Partners&lt;/STRONG&gt; that the Premium AI edition is part of the &lt;STRONG&gt;Test, Demo, and Development (TDD) license&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which provides a much more convenient model for your non-productive and internal development purposes.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="jacobahtan_0-1762748655159.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337670iAC7B14D2EA3F5CEC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jacobahtan_0-1762748655159.png" alt="jacobahtan_0-1762748655159.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The New "Workspace" UI:&lt;/STRONG&gt; We compared the classic "Basic" UI with the new, full-featured "Workspace," which is the future of the service and includes capabilities like email channel configuration and workflow management.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It's the new, full-featured environment for all document processing tasks . We want to emphasize that &lt;STRONG&gt;from now on, all the latest SAP Document AI features will be available in the Workspace UI only&lt;/STRONG&gt;, so we strongly advise using it for all new projects.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="jacobahtan_2-1762778617735.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338002i32C51D71B4CCA784/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jacobahtan_2-1762778617735.png" alt="jacobahtan_2-1762778617735.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pre-Configured &amp;amp; Custom Content (Schemas):&lt;/STRONG&gt; The service provides many pre-trained models (called "Schemas") for standard documents like invoices and purchase orders. The real power, however, comes from creating &lt;STRONG&gt;custom schemas&lt;/STRONG&gt; for any document type your business needs—from specialized licenses to internal forms.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="jacobahtan_2-1762748655205.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337672iFABDFFF3FF0DDE1F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jacobahtan_2-1762748655205.png" alt="jacobahtan_2-1762748655205.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Generative AI &amp;amp; Instant Learning:&lt;/STRONG&gt; For custom schemas, SAP Document AI leverages Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and extract information. We also demonstrated &lt;STRONG&gt;"Instant Learning,"&lt;/STRONG&gt; where the model learns from your manual corrections &lt;EM&gt;immediately&lt;/EM&gt;. After one correction, it knows how to handle that document layout correctly the next time.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In our demo, we showed how the model initially struggled with a name containing a middle name and extracted the wrong federation name (full name vs. acronym) . After one manual correction and confirmation, it learned immediately. Technically, this feature uses &lt;STRONG&gt;few-shots prompting&lt;/STRONG&gt; to make the underlying LLM aware of your previously reviewed documents to improve accuracy on the next run.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fb3ZP-2bAqK0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Db3ZP-2bAqK0&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fb3ZP-2bAqK0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="200" height="112" scrolling="no" title="Instant Learning in SAP Document AI for Streamline document processing with SAP Document AI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1242538056"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Part 2: A Real-World Use Case: "Vertigo Travels"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;To make this real, we introduced &lt;STRONG&gt;"Vertigo Travels,"&lt;/STRONG&gt; a fictional travel agency specializing in sports and adventure holidays. Their key challenge is managing the various kind of documents required for subscriptions, such as ID cards, medical certificates, and diving licenses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="jacobahtan_3-1762748655218.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337673i4B1770A465F5332A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jacobahtan_3-1762748655218.png" alt="jacobahtan_3-1762748655218.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175107270"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The solution architecture includes:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Vertigo Travels website&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a frontend application,&amp;nbsp; deployed in Cloud Foundry, serving as entry point for Travelers to select travel packages and upload the necessary documents, such as ID cards or medical certificates. The backend logic is a &lt;STRONG&gt;CAP (Node.js)&lt;/STRONG&gt; application also deployed in a cloud Foundry.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Document AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;, for all document intelligence operations, communicating via &lt;STRONG&gt;API&lt;/STRONG&gt; with our backend application.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as a persistence layer for our application, to store all the entities involved in the subscription process.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Work Zone standard edition&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as the entry point for Vertigo Travels employees to supervise the process. From Work Zone, business users can access the Vertigo Travel website for admin operations, or the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Document AI workspace&lt;/STRONG&gt;, for instance to review documents. SAP Build Work Zone also allows business users to use SAP Document AI via mobile.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt;, to define business rules to automate some document validation checks. Although this could also be implemented as part of the &amp;nbsp;Vertigo Travels backend application, SAP Build Process Automation enables citizen developers to modify easily the business logics when required.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as the core SAP Cloud solution. The Vertigo Travels backend is integrated with modules such as Business Partners, Products, Sales Orders/Invoice, Customer Return for refund.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1107676484"&gt;For the source code, you may refer &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-generative-ai-hub-use-cases/tree/main/53-vertigo-travels-documentai" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here for reference&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;P.S. if you're planning to work on this prototype, please give us a shout out~! So at least we know somebody is trying our repository out!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="jacobahtan_0-1762777602698.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337997i11A82F6B49B135F4/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jacobahtan_0-1762777602698.png" alt="jacobahtan_0-1762777602698.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-911162979"&gt;We demonstrated three end-to-end scenarios:&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The E2E Flow:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A traveler, Mary, subscribes on the website and uploads her documents. A back-office employee, Barry, reviews and corrects one document in the Document AI Workspace. Once confirmed, a Sales Order is automatically created in S/4HANA Cloud.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-Channel Ingestion:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A traveler, Luca, visits an office. The employee uses &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Mobile Start&lt;/STRONG&gt; to scan his ID and medical certificate. The system then automatically emails Luca about a missing document. He simply replies to the email with his license attached, which is automatically ingested via the &lt;STRONG&gt;Inbound Channel&lt;/STRONG&gt; feature.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Automation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A traveler, Claire, uploads an income statement to apply for a discount. &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt; runs a rule to check her eligibility. When she submits her final documents, they have a high confidence score and are &lt;STRONG&gt;auto-confirmed&lt;/STRONG&gt; without any manual review.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FfaKqdkL1UmI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfaKqdkL1UmI&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FfaKqdkL1UmI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="200" height="113" scrolling="no" title="Use Case end to end demo for Streamline document processing with SAP Document AI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-456484036"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Part 3: How We Built It (The Technical Deep Dive)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-518135969"&gt;For our developer community, we walked through the "how-to" for the key components.&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-450705183"&gt;For the source code, you may refer &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-generative-ai-hub-use-cases/tree/main/53-vertigo-travels-documentai" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here for reference&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;P.S. if you're planning to work on this prototype, please give us a shout out~! So at least we know somebody is trying our repository out!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Setup and Schema Management:&lt;/STRONG&gt; We started with the BTP setup, which involves managing entitlements, creating the service instance, and, critically, &lt;STRONG&gt;establishing trust with SAP Cloud Identity Service (IAS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; for user authorization. We then showed how to create the custom schemas that power the application.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;When you set up your entitlements, make sure to use the application subscription ending in &lt;STRONG&gt;-ias (Identity Authentication Service)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as this is the one that provisions the new Workspace interface.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. API-Driven Development:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Our CAP application's backend communicates directly with Document AI's APIs. We showed code snippets for uploading a file (using the FileService) and processing it against a schema (using the SchemaService).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How to retrieve specific extracted values:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;While our demo UI showed a simple text extraction, your application will likely need specific, structured data (like "gross_family_income" or "number_of_kids"). The API makes this straightforward:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;After processing the document, you get a Document ID.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can use this Document ID to retrieve the Document Version ID.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Using the Version ID, you can then query the Entities for that document. 4. Finally, you can retrieve the specific value by using the Entity ID (e.g., the ID for your "number_of_kids" field) .&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is how our automation process, for example, was able to pull only the family income and number of kids to pass to the rules engine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Configuring Email Ingestion:&lt;/STRONG&gt; We configured the "Channels" feature to monitor an email inbox. This required registering an app in Microsoft Azure, granting Mail.ReadWrite permissions , and then using the Document AI Workspace to map a specific email folder to our target schema.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F2CFz59M6QkE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2CFz59M6QkE&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F2CFz59M6QkE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="200" height="113" scrolling="no" title="Email Ingestion by SAP Document AI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Enabling SAP Mobile Start:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This was a key integration for the in-office scenario. It involved three steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Adding the Document AI dependency to SAP Build Work Zone within the IAS console.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creating a specific BTP destination (sapdocumentaimobilestartintegration).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configuring the app tile in the Work Zone Site Manager with the correct navigation and visualization parameters (e.g., mobilestart.type = documentAi).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F6zSnSLFhono%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6zSnSLFhono&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F6zSnSLFhono%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="200" height="113" scrolling="no" title="Document Scanning with SAP Mobile Start integrated with SAP Document AI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Automating Logic with SAP Build Process Automation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; To keep our application logic flexible, we externalized our validation rules. We created a process in SAP Build Process Automation with a &lt;STRONG&gt;Decision Table (Rule)&lt;/STRONG&gt; to calculate the family discount based on income and number of kids. This process is exposed as an API and triggered by our CAP application.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FULpiT681ooQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DULpiT681ooQ&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FULpiT681ooQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="200" height="113" scrolling="no" title="Decision Rules in Build Process Automation for Streamline document processing with SAP Document AI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="jacobahtan_5-1762748655258.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/337675iDE3C9EE786CF3B6B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="jacobahtan_5-1762748655258.png" alt="jacobahtan_5-1762748655258.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-125108959"&gt;For the source code, you may refer &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-generative-ai-hub-use-cases/tree/main/53-vertigo-travels-documentai" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;here for reference&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;P.S. if you're planning to work on this prototype, please give us a shout out~!

External LLM providers are carefully selected and are &lt;STRONG&gt;not permitted to store or retrain their models on customer data&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Features like continuous data sharing for model improvement are strictly opt-in and should not be used for sensitive personal data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--246259918"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Get Started and Look Ahead&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are committed to helping our partners build on this platform.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We're happy to announce the release of the completely restructured and rewritten documentation for the Kyma Telemetry module! We've moved from a component-centric view to a user-first, task-oriented structure, all centered around a new, unified&amp;nbsp;Telemetry Pipeline API.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Telemetry Module Docs.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336634i9190AAC42FF253EC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Telemetry Module Docs.png" alt="Telemetry Module Docs.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1764560176"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1568046671"&gt;What's New for Our Users?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Unified Telemetry Pipeline API&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;– At the heart of the new structure is the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/telemetry-pipeline-api?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=Cloud" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Telemetry Pipeline API&lt;/A&gt;. With the introduction of OTLP-based LogPipelines, you can now use a consistent set of CRDs to configure all your telemetry signals, which reduces complexity and makes your setup easier to maintain.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Clearer, Task-Based Structure&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;– Find what you need faster with new top-level guides for&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/collecting-logs?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=Cloud" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Collecting Logs&lt;/A&gt;,&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/collecting-traces?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=Cloud" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Collecting Traces&lt;/A&gt;, and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/collecting-metrics?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=Cloud" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Collecting Metrics&lt;/A&gt;. Each guide walks you through the process for a specific signal, from minimal setup to advanced configuration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Clear Migration Path&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;– If you're still using the legacy Fluent Bit (HTTP) log output, read&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/migrate-your-logpipeline-from-http-to-otlp?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=Cloud" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Migrate Your LogPipeline From HTTP to OTLP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, which&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;guides you step-by-step to switch to the new OTLP setup without data loss.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371533166"&gt;The 'Why' Behind the Change: A Look at the Craft&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you're a fellow tech writer or just curious about the &lt;EM&gt;why&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, this wasn't just a rewrite; it was a fundamental shift in our information architecture:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our previous documentation was&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;component-centric&lt;/STRONG&gt;. It described each component (Telemetry Manager, gateways, agents, pipelines...) and its internal architecture, explaining &lt;EM&gt;"What does the component do?"&lt;/EM&gt;. Based on that, the reader had to figure out how to accomplish a task.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our new approach is&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;goal-oriented&lt;/STRONG&gt;, built on principles from the DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) and industry best practices. Our guiding question is "What is the user trying to &lt;EM&gt;achieve&lt;/EM&gt;?" This led us to structure the content as self-contained pages, each focusing on a user goal. For readers interested in the nitty-gritty details - you still find all of those in the consolidated &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/telemetry-architecture?version=Cloud&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Architecture docs&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175019661"&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This new structure makes it easier to see what's common and what's different for the Telemetry pipeline types. Furthermore, we've re-centered the documentation on the actions you need to perform:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Start with your goal:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Task-oriented titles such as &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/monitor-pipeline-health?version=Cloud&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Monitor Pipeline Health&lt;/A&gt; help you find what you need without knowing our internal component names.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Progressive disclosure of information:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Get started with a minimal configuration quickly, and then explore advanced operations like filtering or processing only when you need them.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Get straight to the point:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;With consolidated &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/troubleshooting-for-telemetry-module?version=Cloud&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;troubleshooting&lt;/A&gt; instructions on the top level, you can start start fixing issues immediately&amp;nbsp;without reading through unrelated details&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-978506156"&gt;Get Started Today&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We invite you to dive into the new&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/kyma-telemetry-module?locale=en-US&amp;amp;version=Cloud" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Telemetry module documentation&lt;/A&gt;. We're proud of this new structure and believe it's a clear step up for clarity and usability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781992651"&gt;Your Feedback Matters&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whether you're a user of the module or a fellow writer, we'd love to hear your thoughts. Give us feedback directly on the SAP Help Portal pages. Your input is crucial as we continue to evolve our content.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

The focus is on exploring how Joule can support users through end-to-end process creation by providing intelligent suggestions, automating repetitive steps, and enabling seamless collaboration with key stakeholders. We aim to understand usability, clarity of guidance, efficiency gains, and how well Joule integrates into existing SAP Build Process Automation workflows.

In SAP landscapes, this means you can consolidate complex integration flows and reduce payload size.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This article introduces GraphQL basics and demonstrates how to integrate SAP Cloud Integration with GraphQL APIs, delivering practical and step-by-step hands on you can apply to your own integration scenarios.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recently I had an opportunity to work on an integration project where the customer extensively leveraged GraphQL APIs. That's where I thought sharing my experience will be helpful for developers to help in their GraphQL integration journey.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1433516196"&gt;What is GraphQL?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Before we dive into actual integration flow, let us first try to understand some basics of GraphQL.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;GraphQL is a query language for APIs that executes queries against a defined and a strongly-typed schema. Unlike traditional REST APIs that expose multiple endpoints for specific data objects, GraphQL APIs provide a single endpoint where clients can request exactly the fields they need, avoiding both over-fetching and under-fetching of data.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is a schema based approach that gives the consumers of the APIs more control over the data retrieval at the same time making integrations more flexible, particularly in complex enterprise landscapes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before jumping on the GraphQL integration, first take a look at a sample GraphQL API (which I have also used in my demo)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Countries API: Explore country details such as languages, capitals, and regions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Endpoint:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://countries.trevorblades.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;https://countries.trevorblades.com/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Example Query 1: Fetch all countries.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
  countries {
    code
    name
    capital
    continent {
      name
    }
    languages {
      name
    }
  }
}
​&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Example Query 2: Fetch country with code&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;query {
  country(code:"US") {
    code
    name
    capital
    continent {
      name
    }
    languages {
      name
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In the above two examples, if you see the API endpoint remains same but the query changes based on the desired response. You can add or remove attributes from the query section.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Try out by yourself and you will understand the basics quickly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1237002691"&gt;The Core Challenges&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Unlike OData or SOAP, there isn’t a native GraphQL adapter available in SAP BTP Cloud Integration. This means you can’t directly select a “GraphQL” protocol from the standard adapter list when configuring your integration flows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Good News:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;We can leverage standard HTTP adapter for this type of integration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You must also set appropriate HTTP headers (such as Content-Type, authentication/tokens etc.). Parsing the flexible GraphQL responses often involves extra effort during mapping or transformation compared to protocol-specific adapters.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Another challenge is that as GraphQL provides flexible schema, there is often no OpenAPI or Swagger specifications available for these APIs. This makes integration highly adaptable but developers have to rely on documentation instead of OpenAPI contract like YAML file. Which means you may not be able to directly use standard message mappings directly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Good News: &lt;/STRONG&gt;We can leverage converters (JSON to XML) and groovy scripting extensively to handle transformations and message processing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1040489186"&gt;Real World Use Case&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I tackled a real-world scenario which I will explain briefly. The use case centered around synchronizing stock levels between an e-commerce platform and SAP S/4HANA.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Whenever the e-commerce marketplace detects an order change, it sends a notification event to the integration flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The flow receives this event and extracts the order code from the notification event.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Using this order code, the flow triggers a GraphQL API call to fetch up-to-date order details for that order code from the customer e-commerce platform.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The retrieved order information is then mapped to the corresponding SAP S/4HANA object, enabling an accurate and timely order data integrity within the ERP system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This integration ensures both systems remain aligned and allows real-time order data synchronization based on event-based design.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To simulate this integration, I used a similar workflow, but using the countries GraphQL API to explain the integration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-843975681"&gt;Integration Flow Walkthrough&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this section, I will walk you through the integration flow (iFlow) to connect SAP BTP Cloud Integration with a GraphQL API. Below is a screenshot of the iFlow design, highlighting the main components involved in orchestrating the request and handling the response.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Integration_Flow.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338129i2AC5691AC0FA282C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Integration_Flow.png" alt="Integration_Flow.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Figure-1: Integration Flow&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We will break down main steps to understand:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How the flow is structured&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How the HTTP adapter is configured&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How message processing and data mapping are managed for GraphQL integration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Groovy Scripting:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Groovy gives control for creating GraphQL request. Here is a sample groovy script which I have used&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import com.sap.gateway.ip.core.customdev.util.Message;
import groovy.json.JsonSlurper;
import groovy.json.JsonBuilder;

def Message processData(Message message) 
{
	def body = message.getBody(java.lang.String) as String;
	def jsonInput = new JsonSlurper().parseText(body);

	if(!jsonInput) {
		throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input payload is empty or null");
	}
	
	def countryCode = (jsonInput.countryCode != null) ? jsonInput.countryCode : "IN";

	def graphQLQuery = """query {
  		country(code: "${countryCode}") {
  		  name
  		  native
  		  capital
  		  currency
  		  languages {
  		    name
  		  }
  		}
	}""";
	
	// Convert the GraphQL query into a JSON payload and set it as message body
    def jsonBody = new JsonBuilder([query: graphQLQuery]).toString()
    message.setBody(jsonBody)
	message.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

	//log message body
	def messageLog = messageLogFactory.getMessageLog(message);
	if(messageLog != null) {
		messageLog.addAttachmentAsString("GraphQL Request Body", jsonBody, "text/plain");
	}

	return message;
}​&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HTTP Adapter:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Use standard HTTP adapter to provide GraphQL API endpoint, authentication, additional headers etc. In this POC, I have skipped the authentication piece as our main focus is GraphQL API integration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;JSON to XML Converter:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;After getting the JSON response, leverage the JSON to XML converter to get the XML payload.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Message Mapping:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Once you get the sample XML, generate an XSD using XSD generator tools. This XSD can be used as a source XSD in the message mapping component. The target XSD is the one which you can get the the target API schema (Either SOAP Or OData)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;I have provided the integration flows in my &lt;A href="https://github.com/avinashvaidya09/graphql-integration" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;GitHub&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Take time to download the package, deploy it in your tenant and give it a try.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-647462176"&gt;Mutations&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the above integration flow, I have only shown how to get the data using GraphQL APIs. But in real world you might also be required to create or update data. The countries GraphQL API is READ ONLY but I will explain theoretically how we can accomplish it in a groovy which you can use it as reference (provided your API supports it).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Suppose I want to update capital name of any country.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import com.sap.gateway.ip.core.customdev.util.Message;
import groovy.json.JsonSlurper;
import groovy.json.JsonBuilder;

def String getGraphQLQuery() {
    return '''
    mutation UpdateCountryCapital($input: UpdateCountryInput!) {
      updateCountryCapital(input: $input) {
        code
        name
        capital
      }
    }
    '''
}

def Message processData(Message message) 
{
    def body = message.getBody(java.lang.String) as String
    def inputJson = new JsonSlurper().parseText(body)
    if (!inputJson) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input payload is empty or null");
    }
    // Compose the input for GraphQL variables
    def inputMap = [
        code: inputJson.code,
        capital: inputJson.capital
    ]

    // Build the GraphQL mutation payload
    def graphQLBody = [
        query: getGraphQLQuery(),
        variables: [input: inputMap]
    ]
    def jsonBody = new JsonBuilder(graphQLBody).toString()
    message.setBody(jsonBody)
    message.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

    // Optional: log message body
    def messageLog = messageLogFactory.getMessageLog(message);
    if(messageLog != null) {
        messageLog.addAttachmentAsString("GraphQL Request Body", jsonBody, "text/plain");
    }

    return message;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Above groovy is an example to showcase how to build CREATE/UPDATE request for GraphQL API.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-450948671"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Integrating GraphQL APIs with SAP BTP Cloud Integration opens up flexible, dynamic data exchange between external applications and your SAP landscape even without a native GraphQL adapter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;By leveraging the HTTP adapter, Groovy scripting and powerful message processing tools like JSON-to-XML conversion and custom mappings, you can successfully bridge the gap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;While GraphQL’s adaptable schema presents unique integration challenges, it also enables precise and efficient data retrieval. With a clear understanding of the core concepts, tools and practical steps covered in this walkthrough, you are ready to design robust solutions for similar event-driven scenarios in your own enterprise.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This is not an official reference application or documentation.
