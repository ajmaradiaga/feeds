    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This third post in my series gives an overview of the very latest user experience innovations in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508, which are so new that they are only released for customers to try them out via beta testing. They are all AI-related, for My Home, for working with SAP Fiori elements based applications, as well as for some individual application use cases.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In case you missed them, &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-2-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-2508-and-sap/ba-p/14171291" target="_blank"&gt;Part 2&lt;/A&gt; covers the generally available UX innovations in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508, and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;Part 1&lt;/A&gt; explains how users in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition can query SAP Analytics Cloud directly via Joule, as well as providing general information about Joule and central entry points and services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This post covers these innovations for:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;My Home&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted&amp;nbsp;smart solution for situations in&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;My Home.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted&amp;nbsp;smart personalization of&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;My Home&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;for applications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Fiori elements based applications&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted&amp;nbsp;easy fill.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted&amp;nbsp;error explanation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Individual application uses cases&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-assisted&amp;nbsp;payment exception analysis.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accounting accruals agent.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you want to try out these features as beta testers, then sign-up for beta testing here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/3910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Q3/25: Latest AI-assisted user experience features in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find out more about beta programs and how to &lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/programs/get-involved-early.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Get Involved Early&lt;/A&gt; with SAP innovations in general.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607832527"&gt;My Home UX Innovations&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1540401741"&gt;AI-Assisted Smart Solution for Situations in My Home&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this feature, you can now get details of a Business Situation shown directly in place on My Home, and even initiate quick actions or make changes to business data there. This is achieved by expanding the Situation card on My Home when you click on it, as you can see in Figure 1, or in action in this video:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Video: &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/tSpQrWC?ltr=v&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1206840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI-Assisted Smart Solution for Situations in My Home in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/A&gt; (1:00 min.)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: Beta: AI-Assisted Smart Solution for Situations in My Home.

Now, with this beta functionality, you can use natural language to find and add applications and insights tiles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have the functionality activated in your system, you’ll see the AI button “Add Content” in the salutation bar at the top of My Home, as shown at the top of Figure 2. Clicking on this brings a pop-over with the option to add Insights Cards or, as shown, Apps &amp;amp; Insights Tiles. By describing what you want to do, the system will propose suitable applications and Insights Tiles. If you select them and click “Add”, they will be added, either as an entry in your Apps Favorites section, or in the Insights Tiles section. Figure 2 shows these main steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 2: Beta: AI-Assisted Smart Personalization of My Home for Applications.

This new feature makes it much easier to update the fields in the various sections of an object page based on SAP Fiori elements, such as a sales order. Instead of manually scanning the e-mail and navigating to the relevant sections and fields in the object page, you can just paste the text into Easy Fill and it will automatically identify the correct fields to update, with proposals for the correct entries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The power of AI means that the new values do not have to be exactly contained in the text. Figure 3 shows an example, where the new address is given without actually mentioning the name of the city, only the street and post code, along with an abbreviation for the state and country (“BW DE”). As you can see, the proposed new values are correct, despite this missing or abbreviated information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3: Beta: AI-Assisted Easy Fill for SAP Fiori elements based applications.

The explanation I gave in my February blog post continues to apply:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;New users who are unfamiliar with the system may find that the short error messages give too little information for them to fully understand the issue, and what to do about it. The AI-Assisted Error Explanation (beta) in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition summarizes information which explains the error and provide a recommendation for how to resolve it. Figure 8 shows an example where a user has entered a Sold-to-Party ID which does not exist in the system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note that this feature is also only available for applications based on SAP Fiori elements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 4: Beta: AI-Assisted Error Explanation in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2502.

These issues are collected in error logs, and one of the more tedious tasks of Accounts Payable Accountant is to scan through these error logs, understand what went wrong and why, and then fix it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With AI-assisted payment exception analysis, we make this task much easier and less tedious: users can choose an entry in the error log and simply click on the AI button “Analyze Exception”. The system then provide an analysis, a recommended resolution in natural language, as well as a links to a selection of the most relevant log entries. If a user wants all the relevant logs, they are just one click away. Figure 5 shows what this looks like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 5: Beta: AI-assisted payment exception analysis.

That way, when looking at a particular period such as a quarter or a month, accountants get a more accurate picture of a company’s financial position. For example, if a service was delivered, but not paid for within the period, having the accrual means that the cost of delivering the service and the revenue associated with it both appear in the summary for the period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Calculating accruals and deferrals is often time very time consuming. It can also require estimates based on historical data, if for example invoices have not yet been created, or payment amounts can be reduced if payments are made quickly in the future.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new accounting accruals agent can significantly speed this up, potentially reducing the time spent on these activities by 80%! This frees up accountants to work on more value-adding activities, such as analysis. As you can see in Figure 6, the agent creates a list of accrual proposals. For each proposal, you can details on the recommendation, including an explanation for the basis of the recommendation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 6: Beta: Accrual Proposals made by the accounting accruals agent.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the SAP Mobile Start 2.4 release, users can leverage SAP Document AI—integrated seamlessly within the Mobile Start app—to transform document handling into a secure, intelligent, and automated experience. They can scan or upload documents directly from SAP Mobile Start, which are then processed by the SAP Document AI service.&amp;nbsp;This streamlines processing, cuts down manual work, and boosts data accuracy throughout your operations.&amp;nbsp;In this blog, I'll walk you through the integration steps, prerequisites, and configuration details needed to bring SAP Document AI capabilities to your mobile users.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1735962950"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Preconditions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before you begin, ensure the following prerequisites are fulfilled.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1797614883"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Subscribe to SAP Document AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensure that your SAP BTP subaccount is subscribed to the Document Information Extraction service (document-information-extraction-application-ias with embedded_edition instance). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once complete, access the SAP Document AI&amp;nbsp;workspace from your BTP subscriptions to configure document types and schemas relevant to your business scenarios.

The file size must not exceed 50 MB, and the document should contain no more than 100 pages. Additionally, file names are automatically sanitized to remove any invalid characters. Once these checks are successfully passed, the upload process begins, with a visible progress bar indicating status. Android users can upload multiple documents synchronously.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After the upload is complete, the document extraction workflow is triggered, and users receive a success notification confirming the process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--861750767"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Track Status and Review Document&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To monitor the progress of document extraction, simply open the Document Overview from the overflow menu within the document selection screen. This action launches the mobile-optimized SAP Document AI UI, providing a clear and intuitive view of the status, allowing reviews and other updates related to your uploaded documents.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="T3F.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/297916iE46168103ABCA363/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="T3F.png" alt="T3F.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Screenshot: Track status and review document via mobile optimized UI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--471458258"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Conclusion&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the release of SAP Mobile Start 2.4 and the seamless integration of SAP Document AI, business users now benefit from a truly mobile-first, intelligent document processing experience. Whether it's capturing receipts on the go, processing invoices, or extracting data from complex forms, SAP Document AI empowers users to automate workflows efficiently—right from their mobile devices. This integration brings the power of AI-driven document handling directly to your fingertips, enabling smarter, faster, and more scalable business operations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

The Create and Delete buttons are available for creating new records and deleting existing records. Since this is Managed RAP application, the code necessary for the Create and delete operations are handled automatically by the Framework, there is no explicit code necessary for these simple actions. If customizations are required then it can be handled via Implementation Class (Behaviour Pool Classes) of the Behaviour Definition.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-625263914"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Project link:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://github.com/ABAPAnitha/RAP-for-Bill-doc-header-and-Items" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;https://github.com/ABAPAnitha/RAP-for-Bill-doc-header-and-Items&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="" id="toc-hId-557833128"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;This project highlights how quickly and efficiently a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Managed RAP application&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;can be built on SAP BTP using the ABAP RESTful Programming Model.&amp;nbsp;The framework automatically handled the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Create&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Delete&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;operations, proving the advantage of Managed scenarios where minimal custom coding is required.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;We also learned how&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;UI metadata annotations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;can be used to control the look and feel of the Fiori Elements-based UI without any frontend coding, and how RAP’s structured approach — from database table to service binding — enables a clean, maintainable, and extensible application design.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Going forward, you can extend this solution with:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom business logic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;in Behavior Pool classes,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Associations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;to billing item entities for a complete billing document structure,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Advanced annotations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for richer UI interactions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Overall, the Managed RAP approach proved to be a fast, cloud-compliant, and developer-friendly way to deliver maintainable SAP applications aligned with the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;strategy.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607946884"&gt;SAPUI5 flexibility to adapt standard SAP apps&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAPUI5 is SAP’s strategic Web framework for SAP Fiori. SAPUI5 flexibility allows developers, key users and end users to adapt standard apps with simple drag-and-drop tools. It supports a clean core approach by enabling on-stack extensions without requiring any predefined extension points. Discover all the capabilities in&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/UI5_FLEXIBILITY/430e2c1a4ff241bc8162df4bf51e0730/e36d19b3d24f47199a9a82d3faa508c3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAPUI5 Flexibility - All You Need to Know&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1411433379"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Changing texts of SAP standard apps &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;One common use case in this context is changing labels of SAP standard apps to match the terminology used by end users. Similarly, a table column might need to show either the ID of a business object, its text, or even both.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1214919874"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;New Feature: Consistent text changes across multiple fields&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Previously, if a field appeared multiple times (e.g., in the filter bar and a table column), each occurrence had to be changed separately. Now in&amp;nbsp;SAP S/4HANA Cloud and with SAPUI5 1.136 on SAP BTP, text changes are now applied at the model level in annotations. To do this, the key user does not have to make a decision, the change is automatically applied at the 'lowest possible level'.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I need to be more specific about what the mentioned text changes are, for which this logic applies:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Changing labels&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Key users can change the field labels according to the terminology used by end users:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Dialog to change a label" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299209iA22D72F125C89D48/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ChangeLabels.png" alt="Dialog to change a label" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Dialog to change a label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Changing text arrangements&lt;/STRONG&gt;: By setting the text arrangement, key users can show the descriptive text of some business entity only, the text together with the technical ID or just the ID:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Dialog to change a text arrangement" style="width: 994px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/299210iDAE7E5D1667583EB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ChangeTextArrangement.png" alt="Dialog to change a text arrangement" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Dialog to change a text arrangement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new logic allows key users to focus on the business data model rather than the app's implementation details, enhancing efficiency when adapting standard apps. Also, business users can work more productively with the right text helping them to identify the data they need.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This logic works with annotations and is available in apps based on SAP Fiori elements patterns or using building blocks of the Flexible Programming Model. For more details, see the documentation: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ui5-flexibility-for-key-users/ui5-flexibility-for-key-users/making-ui-changes#renaming-a-ui-element" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Renaming a UI Element&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ui5-flexibility-for-key-users/ui5-flexibility-for-key-users/making-ui-changes#changing-the-text-arrangement" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Changing the Text Arrangement&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1018406369"&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Going forward&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The UI5 team plans* to extend this logic to other types of changes, beyond simple text changes. We will share more details in official UI5 channels like the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73554900100800001361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAPUI5 Road Map&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/sdk/#/topic/99ac68a5b1c3416ab5c84c99fefa250d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAPUI5 What's New&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, and document&lt;SPAN&gt;at&lt;/SPAN&gt;ion in &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="http://help.sap.com/disclaimer?site=https://help.sap.com/docs/UI5_FLEXIBILITY/430e2c1a4ff241bc8162df4bf51e0730/e36d19b3d24f47199a9a82d3faa508c3.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What is SAPUI5 Flexibility&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By the way, be sure to follow the latest updates in Key User Adaptation.

It covers Joule and many AI-based UX innovations along with enhanced user experiences. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;By following the career of Jon, who starts by applying for a job and then grows within the company, you can see how our latest user experience innovations help business users (employees and managers), work more effectively.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before reading this, do read the first blog post introducing the series and providing general information about Joule and central entry points and services, along with links to all the published parts of this blog post series:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also, if you missed it, do have a look at the many UX innovations which already came out end of last year with the SAP SuccessFactors 2H2024 release:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q1-2025-update-part-3-sap-successfactors-ai-joule-and/ba-p/14020027" target="_blank"&gt;SAP User Experience Q1/2025 Update – Part 3: SAP SuccessFactors (AI, Joule and More)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 1H2025 release comes with a large number of UX innovations across the whole portfolio. &lt;SPAN&gt;In the following sections, I’ll summarize the main highlights by following the career of Jon, and showing how the new AI-powered UX innovations help:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon find the right job with the help of the new guided application experience.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Managers move through the hiring process more efficiently, rating skills and competencies of candidates with Joule, and getting AI-assisted interview insights.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon understand the main features available to him in his employee HR applications.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon get an easy-to-understand overview of his benefits and payroll.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon use natural language with &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt; to get questions answered and detailed information about pay statements, not only from at his desk but &lt;STRONG&gt;also via mobile phone.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon learn more, with learning overview and skilled-based learning recommendations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon and his manager to manage goals and performance reviews, with AI-insights making his manager’s job a lot easier.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;One more innovation is the new alumni experience, for departing and departed employees, helping them to&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage personal information and access important documents during and after the off-boarding process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To get the complete picture of all the new SuccessFactors innovations, have a look at the links in the “Further Information “ section towards the end of this post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607984268"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Find the Right Job With New Guided Application Experience&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Jon is applying for a job at a company which uses SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting, and finds the whole process very intuitive, thanks to the new guided application experience, as well as the further enhancements in the reimagined candidate experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 1 shows the new guided application experience. This attractive UI guides applicants through the required steps, with AI-assistance provided along the way. For example, Figure 1 shows the AI button “Suggest Skills”, which can help candidates when listing their own skills by indicating other skills which they may also have but did not consider mentioning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: Guided job application experience with SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting.

If Jon wants to review his candidate profile and make adjustments, this is also easier now with the refreshed candidate profile.

This can now be done easily using Joule and natural language, where you can say who you want to give feedback for and assing the ratings all in one go, as you can see in Figure 2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 2: Providing interview feedback with Joule.

This is where the AI-assisted interview insights comes in handy: by clicking on the AI “generate” button, the manager gets a natural language summary of the interviewer’s feedback on the candidate Jon. This is provided in sections Overview, Strengths, Concerns, Interviewer’s Overall Feedback, with a separate section Data Referenced that provides an overview of the inputs used to create the AI-assisted insights. Figure 3 shows an example, and Figure 4 shows it in action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not only does this help the manager save time and be more efficient, it also helps her be more effective: the feedback across multiple candidates is consolidated consistently, ensuring that all aspects of a candidate’s interview feedback are consolidated and uniformly presented. Furthermore, key insights are highlighted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3: AI-assisted interview insights with SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting.

This is now easy with the enhanced People Profile in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, which provides quick access to the various parts of your benefits (Figure 6) and payroll information (Figure 7).

    select from mlc.Employees {
      key status
    } group by status;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;key status → Marks status as the unique identifier in the list.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;group by status → Ensures we only get distinct statuses (case-sensitive).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This becomes the data source for the MultiComboBox items.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3: Add XML namespaces&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Make sure your XML file includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;xmlns:smartfilterbar="sap.ui.comp.smartfilterbar"

xmlns:smartField="sap.ui.comp.smartfield"

xmlns:core="sap.ui.core"

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 4: Replace smart filter with a Smart MultiComboBox&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;smartfilterbar:ControlConfiguration

    key="status"

    index="30"

    label="Status"

    visibleInAdvancedArea="true"

    filterType="searchExpression"

    groupId="_BASIC"&amp;gt;

   

    &amp;lt;smartfilterbar:customControl&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;MultiComboBox

            id="StatusDropDown"

            items="{path: '/StatusDropDown', sorter: {path: 'status'}}"&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;items&amp;gt;

                &amp;lt;core:Item key="{status}" text="{status}" /&amp;gt;

            &amp;lt;/items&amp;gt;

        &amp;lt;/MultiComboBox&amp;gt;

    &amp;lt;/smartfilterbar:customControl&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/smartfilterbar:ControlConfiguration&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;We bind the MultiComboBox to the /StatusDropDown entity.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The status field is both the key and display text.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Sorting ensures the list looks organized.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5: Hook into beforeRebindTable&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Add this in your Smart Table XML:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;beforeRebindTable="onBeforeRebindTable"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 6: Import libraries in your controller&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;"sap/ui/model/Filter",
"sap/ui/model/FilterOperator",&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 7: Filtering logic for multiple selections&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;onBeforeRebindTable: function (oEvent) {

    const oBindingParams = oEvent.getParameter("bindingParams");

    const aStatus = this.getView().byId("StatusDropDown").getSelectedKeys();

    if (aStatus &amp;amp;&amp;amp; aStatus.length &amp;gt; 0) {
        const orFilters = aStatus.map(status =&amp;gt;
            new Filter("status", FilterOperator.EQ, status)
        );

        oBindingParams.filters.push(
            new Filter({ filters: orFilters, and: false }) // OR logic

    }

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 8: Test it out&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Reload the app, open the filter bar, and you should see your MultiComboBox instead of the regular filter.&lt;BR /&gt;Pick a few statuses &amp;nbsp;and the table should only show matching records.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MaheshSirsat1708_2-1755277860367.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301544iAE7A1EACFD64F514/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MaheshSirsat1708_2-1755277860367.png" alt="MaheshSirsat1708_2-1755277860367.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MaheshSirsat1708_3-1755278434935.png" style="width: 897px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301547iDB4712AD23B4E7A5/image-dimensions/897x213?v=v2" width="897" height="213" role="button" title="MaheshSirsat1708_3-1755278434935.png" alt="MaheshSirsat1708_3-1755278434935.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By converting a multi-value Smart Filter into a &lt;STRONG&gt;Smart MultiComboBox&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Gave users the flexibility to select &lt;STRONG&gt;multiple exact matches&lt;/STRONG&gt; without typing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Avoided case-sensitivity issues by letting the system pull valid values directly from the backend.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Made the filtering process faster and more reliable for real-world datasets where values like Active, active, and ACTIVE might all exist.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach is clean, reusable, and works seamlessly with Smart Table + Smart Filter Bar setups in SAPUI5.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This fifth post in my series gives an overview of latest UX innovations in &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass, products for managing your spend (procurement) and external workforce&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;For SAP Ariba: Joule is now available for selected products, on-boarding guidance is provided by WalkMe, and we have some additional AI-assistance in SAP Ariba Category Management, amongst other enhancements. For SAP Fieldglass, Joule is now available too, and the SOW (Statement of Work) dashboard can now be adapted per user role, ensuring that users see what fits best for them. Also, you can now use generative AI for importing SOWs from documents.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1608756847"&gt;SAP Ariba&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are the recent UX innovations that I have picked:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On-boarding guidance via WalkMe Digital Adoption Platform.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule, our AI copilot, available for selected SAP Ariba products.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;UX enhancements in Category Management: Supplier preferencing, Strategy and Plan enhancements for collaboration and AI-insights, plus some more minor enhancements in details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integration of the SAP User Research Panel into selected products’ built-in user feedback surveys.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1541326061"&gt;On-boarding guidance via WalkMe&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When new employees join the procurement team, we now make it easier for them to get up and running with SAP Ariba by providing enhanced step-by-step guidance on how to get typical tasks done in the system. With the 2508 release, we provide WalkMe for the following SAP Ariba products:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Buying&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Buying and Invoicing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Contracts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Invoice Management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Sourcing&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Ariba Supplier Risk&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;WalkMe offers engaging, intuitive, role-based guidance to help&amp;nbsp;user quickly achieve value by minimizing barriers during initial use of the product and creating a great first experience.

Do they value your custom highly? Or at the opposite extreme, do they see you as a nuisance, i.e. low volume but high effort and hence unprofitable?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supplier preferencing is an established approach that helps organizations understand how they are perceived by vendors. By leveraging this insight, businesses can strengthen supplier relationships, foster collaboration, and improve supply chain effectiveness.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supplier preferencing involves evaluating how suppliers view a buying organization based on two key dimensions:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Attractiveness of Account&lt;/STRONG&gt;: How appealing the buying organization is to the supplier, influenced by factors like reputation, growth potential, and ease of doing business.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Relative Value of Business&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The monetary value or strategic importance the buying organization's spend brings to the supplier.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each dimension can be assessed as “high” or “low”, resulting in four possible categories Core, Development, Nuisance and Exploitable, as explained in the&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Documentation: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ariba/88ea813a3d0f42878f90775648ed03ca/efcd0979d5984ea1abfa9b2abbce1a7f.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Supplier Preferencing&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;We now provide an intuitive user experience for buyers to apply supplier preferencing very easily, and get an easy to understand overview for each supplier and for each strategy and plan you have created for buying from that supplier. Figure 3 shows an example for a fictitious supplier called SpeedShip, where the outcome of assessments for various strategy and plans are shown.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3: Supplier preferencing example in SAP Ariba Category Management.

The &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/japan/design/stories-resources/sap-user-research-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP User Research Panel&lt;/A&gt; gives users the opportunity to sign-up to give feedback to SAP directly. We launched it nearly two years ago, see for example &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/your-voice-matters-join-the-sap-user-research-panel/ba-p/13572934" target="_blank"&gt;Your voice matters! Join the SAP User Research Panel&lt;/A&gt;. Since then many users across all areas have signed up.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We would like to encourage users of SAP Ariba to sign up too, and to make this easier, we have introduced a direct link to it from the user feedback survey. Users of SAP Ariba Category Management and SAP Ariba Supplier Risk occasionally receive a popup with a short survey asking for feedback on the product. Now, at the end of this survey, they are offered a link to sign up to the user resarch panel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find out more in the documentation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ariba/88ea813a3d0f42878f90775648ed03ca/947e4b45dfca4f169a41ae9612a30ab8.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;parentHref=https://help.sap.com/whats-new/6a6876bb02204429bfc72cf8b861a866?locale=en-US%26Version=SAP%2BAriba%2B2508%26q=panel&amp;amp;parentName=What%27s+New+in+SAP+Procurement+and+SAP+Business+Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP User Research Panel for SAP Ariba Category Management&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/ariba/88ea813a3d0f42878f90775648ed03ca/9073399125eb4de78b60fc38a268abcd.html?locale=en-US&amp;amp;parentHref=https://help.sap.com/whats-new/6a6876bb02204429bfc72cf8b861a866?locale=en-US%26Version=SAP%2BAriba%2B2508%26q=panel&amp;amp;parentName=What%27s+New+in+SAP+Procurement+and+SAP+Business+Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP User Research Panel for SAP Ariba Supplier Risk&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--30781979"&gt;Further Information&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;For an overview of the key innovations with the 2508 release of SAP Ariba, have a look at this blog post:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/spend-management-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ariba-2508-release-key-innovations-preview/ba-p/14159593" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Ariba 2508 Release Key Innovations Preview&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-413361880"&gt;SAP Fieldglass&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule is now available for SAP Fieldglass, the Statement of Work (SOW) dashboard has been enhanced to allow role-specific customized views, and you can now use generative AI for importing SOWs from documents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--369957639"&gt;Joule for SAP Fieldglass&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Our AI copilot Joule helps users for these specific activities:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Selecting job posting templates&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Selecting statement of work templates&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Completing work items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Viewing quarterly trends&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Running reports&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Closing workers&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Searching help content&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;As an example of how Joule makes work easier for users, consider finding the right template for a job posting: rather than scanning through available templates, you can just give Joule the position or project, a description, and a few other details, and Joule will provide recommendations for which template to use. Once you have chosen a template, Joule can auto-populate some of the fields, speeding the process up for you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can also use Joule for analytical queries: as Joule to show you quarterly trends, and Joule will show you them in the form of graphs embedded within the Joule UI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 8 shows Joule when first opened in SAP Fieldglass, with hints as clickable buttons for what you can ask for.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 8: Joule in SAP Fieldglass.

This helps track overall SOW progress, maintain budget control, and enable informed decision-making. &amp;nbsp;Last year, we introduced the SOW Dashboard, providing a comprehensive real-time view of critical SOW data (see &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-innovations-in-public-cloud-products-joule-ai-entry-points-apple/ba-p/13594954" target="_blank"&gt;my last year’s blog post&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Users in different business roles need to interact with the SOW, and each role has a unique set of details relevant to them for overseeing the health of the SOW. Now, the SOW dashboard supports customized views based on user roles, which streamlines the information displayed, so that users see only what is most relevant to them. Hence, they get a more focused and efficient experience tailored to their unique needs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 9 shows an example of the SOW Dashboard set up for a user focused on project status and task management. Figure 10 shows an example for a user focused on financials and spend task management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 9: SAP Fieldglass SOW dashboard customized for users focused on project status and task management.

Now, we have significantly improved the user experience by leveraging generative AI to automate a lot of this work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Fieldglass has integrated SAP Document AI, so that users can automate the extraction and transformation of statement of work content from uploaded documents. This combined AI approach parses the source files, identifies relevant content, and generates a structured, accurate draft statement of work, reducing manual effort while improving data consistency and completeness. Figure 10 shows how users now have the new AI-enabled workflow option for creating a statement of work.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 11: New AI-enabled option for creating a statement of work in SAP Fieldglass.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In early 2024, we discovered something surprising.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The average user spent just &lt;STRONG&gt;1 minute and 14 seconds&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the SAP Build Store. Even more striking: &lt;STRONG&gt;nearly 60% of users left within 15 seconds.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;We had invested in pre-designed, ready-to-use solutions, what we call &lt;EM&gt;Templates&lt;/EM&gt;, to accelerate project creation, reduce repetitive tasks, and improve efficiency across SAP Build. But the data told us something else: the feature was practically invisible.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1866916613"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The challenge: our locked treasure&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Why was engagement so low? Our research revealed a few key reasons:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Terminology like “Store” and “Ready to Use” was confusing&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The design was outdated and not aligned with SAP’s Fiori guidelines&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Navigation was weak, leaving users without clear entry points&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Most users only discovered the feature via a lobby shortcut. Without it, usage dropped dramatically&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;We had a powerful capability, but no visibility.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="The original design: outdated, unclear, and often overlooked" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/302263i5113691C1C2C53EB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="OLDSAPCummunity.png" alt="The original design: outdated, unclear, and often overlooked" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;The original design: outdated, unclear, and often overlooked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1670403108"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1473889603"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Strategic context and research&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;This redesign was not done in isolation. It aligned with the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build 2025 strategy&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which emphasizes predefined processes and best practices to accelerate time to value.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;We also reviewed how similar solutions in the market are positioned. A common theme was the strong emphasis on clarity and discoverability, which reinforced the importance of making SAP’s Templates more visible and actionable&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1277376098"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The big idea: make Templates impossible to ignore&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Our guiding principle was simple: &lt;STRONG&gt;Visibility, Clarity, Efficiency.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;If users did not see it, they would not use it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;So the mission was twofold:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Make Templates more discoverable, even without shortcuts&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Clarify their purpose so users could quickly understand and act&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1080862593"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-884349088"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Transformation in action&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;We redesigned the experience with these goals in mind:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consistency:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A modern, structured UI aligned with SAP’s design language&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigation:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Clearer pathways and filters so users could find relevant templates more easily&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cards:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A more engaging presentation with images, clearer actions, and hierarchy&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clarity:&lt;/STRONG&gt; New status badges and improved copy to reduce confusion&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Guidance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A new dialog to help users understand the difference between Pre-built and Sample templates&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Terminology:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;We also introduced several naming changes to reduce confusion and better reflect the feature’s purpose, such as renaming &lt;EM&gt;“Store”&lt;/EM&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;Templates,&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;EM&gt;“Ready to Use”&lt;/EM&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;Pre-built,&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;“Template”&lt;/EM&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;Sample&lt;/STRONG&gt;. These adjustments might look small, but they made the feature’s value clearer and easier to understand.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;In short, the redesign turned Templates from a hidden corner into a visible, structured, and valuable part of the experience.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="The redesigned templates: clearer hierarchy, modern visuals, and consistent actions.." style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/302257iDAEE55623FFAE229/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="NEWSAPCummunity.png" alt="The redesigned templates: clearer hierarchy, modern visuals, and consistent actions.." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;The redesigned templates: clearer hierarchy, modern visuals, and consistent actions..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="New Select Template dialog: shown when creating a template that supports both options, helping users choose between Pre-built and Sample with clearer guidance." style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/302259i228102E3E6D39D99/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="NEW Select Template Type Dialog.png" alt="New Select Template dialog: shown when creating a template that supports both options, helping users choose between Pre-built and Sample with clearer guidance." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;New Select Template dialog: shown when creating a template that supports both options, helping users choose between Pre-built and Sample with clearer guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-687835583"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-491322078"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Testing with users&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;To validate the new approach, we ran &lt;STRONG&gt;two usability studies&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;July 2024:&lt;/STRONG&gt; with 6 internal SAP colleagues who used the Store daily&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;December 2024:&lt;/STRONG&gt; with 5 SAP customers from Vodafone, AIRBUS, Merck, and Twinnings&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;The feedback was clear:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Users finally understood Templates&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Many admitted they had not known the feature even existed before&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Excitement grew as they realized Templates could meaningfully support their workflows&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;One participant summed it up:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Positive step to move from Store to Template.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Every successful business knows that an exceptional user experience is the crown jewel of their operations. Not only does it enhance efficiency and productivity, but it also fosters customer satisfaction, ultimately leading to sustained growth and success in the competitive market.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/highlights-of-the-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-2508-release/ba-p/14163726?emcs_t=S2h8ZW1haWx8a3Vkb3N8TURSM1RaRlpBQVkyUkl8MTQxNjM3MjZ8S1VET1N8aEs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508 release&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; introduces a range of innovative enhancements, tailored to refine user interactions and optimize business processes with the help of artificial intelligence. Let's dive into these user experience highlights that will make your business shine.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;TLDR? Check out this video made by my digital twin to get an overview of my highlights:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_26pcvuqs" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1867064766"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Joule for business&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Speaking of jewels, SAP’s very own AI co-pilot, Joule, introduces advanced intelligent assistance to SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, allowing business users to engage with their systems using natural language for quicker and more impactful results. By integrating artificial intelligence within the system, Joule serves as a digital assistant, revolutionizing the way users navigate and utilize business applications. It eliminates technical obstacles by understanding user intent and providing contextually relevant outcomes through intuitive, conversational interactions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/382ChL5?ltr=a&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1166611" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="maria_silipo_0-1755889179821.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304102i54924E2B5E587B9C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="maria_silipo_0-1755889179821.png" alt="maria_silipo_0-1755889179821.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1670551261"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Joule for consultants&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule for consultants is specifically designed to speed up project delivery by offering instant access to a unique, expertly curated SAP knowledge base. This includes over 200,000 pages of documentation and content from SAP communities, helping consultants find answers quickly and saving up to 1.5 hours daily. It also features SAP-specific code intelligence, reducing code interpretation time by up to 40%. Overall, Joule can accelerate project timelines by up to 14%, cutting a typical 12-to-18-month project by 1.5 to 2.5 months.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/HRLdeuL?ltr=a&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1200468&amp;amp;includeRelatedAssets=true" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="maria_silipo_1-1755889229983.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304103i66D6940D8390725C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="maria_silipo_1-1755889229983.png" alt="maria_silipo_1-1755889229983.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1474037756"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule for developers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule for developers is integrated within the ABAP development tools to enhance productivity by aiding in faster code writing, testing, and delivery for ABAP Cloud. For environments like SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, it reduces development time and effort, speeding up value realization. Key features include predictive code completion, a chat feature for natural language queries, code explanation, and support for generating and improving ABAP unit tests and test classes for CDS entities, ensuring reliable applications.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1277524251"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Design updates for SAP Business Suite consistency&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Navigation has become more seamless than ever with a &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;newly designed navigation menu&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; that removes the extra click previously needed to reach &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My Home&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. Users can now effortlessly access their favorite apps and folders from anywhere within the platform, enhancing efficiency. Additionally, personalization through "All Spaces" further improves ease of use. The introduction of the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;new shell bar&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; maximizes vertical space while prominently displaying the product name. This update needs to be activated using "/UI2/SHELL_BAR_TOGGLE." Please note that adjustments may be necessary for automated testing. The &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;user menu&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; has been overhauled for greater intuitiveness, featuring larger images, improved spacing, and an easily accessible sign-out button. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Notifications&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; have also been refined for better management, allowing users to sort by date or importance with clear categories such as "Today" and "Yesterday." Finally, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;visual enhancements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in Search and Error handling bring a modern touch to the interface, providing users with a smoother and more guided experience.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1081010746"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recap feature on &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My Home&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Moving on to user-centric improvements, the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recap feature &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;is all set to transform how business users stay updated with their &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My Home&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; enhancements. With a focus on saving time, this intelligent feature highlights the changes since the user’s last login by comparing current data with the past 24 hours. It brings tasks needing attention right to the forefront, streamlining decision-making and increasing productivity by allowing users more time for strategic work.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-884497241"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage News app on &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My Home&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage News app&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; strikes at the heart of timely communication. It centralizes internal messages and key updates by enabling the creation and dissemination of news articles directly on &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;My Home&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. Here, administrators can control visibility, categorization, and the targeted audience of news content, facilitating consistent and streamlined communication across teams. This leads to greater connectivity and informed decision-making within the workforce.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-687983736"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-assisted UX features&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-public-edition-2502/ba-p/14109621" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;In my last blog post&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, I introduced some of our AI-assisted UX features&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, which aim &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;to enhance user interactions by making them more intuitive and efficient through AI-driven capabilities.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; With the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; release&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;these&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; AI-assisted &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;UX &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;features are now generally available!&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;We structure them in base features and premium features:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Base features:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;AI-assisted enterprise search&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; (available through &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;beta testing in 2502 release&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Users can access business data efficiently via natural language queries&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; enhancing productivity and user experience.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;This blog post was prompted by a recent issue in SAP customer support for SAP Fiori apps. I want to share the background, hoping it helps prevent a similar situation in your environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1609646920"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Browser and Platform Support&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP's &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/pam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Product Availability Matrix (PAM)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides the single source of truth for SAP software releases, including platform availability on browsers and operating systems. Regarding SAPUI5, note that SAPUI5 is not a product of its own, so please check the PAM for the product you're using SAPUI5 with. For more information, see SAP Note&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/1716423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1716423&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Browsers constantly evolve across devices to offer new capabilities and address newly detected security issues. Upgrades of browsers may introduce changes that are not backward compatible, affecting SAPUI5 and SAP software behavior. Browser upgrades may also require specific platform or operating system versions for all end users. Vendors do not provide (security) updates for browsers or platforms that are out of maintenance, which then are severe risk to productive environments.&amp;nbsp;Keep in mind that SAP has no control over browser upgrades, their capabilities, or maintenance duration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In other words: In Web development, especially with browsers: &lt;STRONG&gt;"Never touch a running system" is *NOT* an option&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1413133415"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Browsers for SAPUI5&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAPUI5 applications in productive SAP products require a minimum browser version to ensure full availability and security. This also lets SAPUI5 use current industry standards, such as &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/0cb44d7a147640a0890cefa5fd7c7f8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ECMAScript&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, to deliver a modern and intuitive experience for SAP Business Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="293385_GettyImages-177504059_large_jpg.jpg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304999iED2B76D7D454CE95/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="293385_GettyImages-177504059_large_jpg.jpg" alt="293385_GettyImages-177504059_large_jpg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Based on my own experience in the SAPUI5 team, I can confirm missing this requirement is a real-life risk. My conversations with customer support colleagues confirm this: productive SAP customers experienced outages because end users worked with browsers that were out of maintenance. One example can be seen in SAP Note &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3639059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;3639059 - Blank home screen in SAP Fiori Launchpad - SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;, which prompted this blog post. Using an outdated browser, end users saw a blank screen; developers got an error "Promise.withResolvers is not a function" in the console. The resolution for such cases is to update to the latest browser version, which in some cases may even require a costly operating system upgrade for all business users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, I recommend monitoring the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://support.sap.com/pam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Product Availability Matrix (PAM)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; and specifically the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/74b59efa0eef48988d3b716bd0ecc933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAPUI5 Browser and Platform Support&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello World! Tudo bem?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Após o encerramento com sucesso do primeiro SAP Inside Track Londrina (2025), que foi um evento somente presencial e contou com muitas apresentações de qualidade, resolvi criar esse material aqui na comunidade para aqueles que não puderam comparecer pessoalmente.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Evento 2025.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305144i1F014271F2B730B8/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Evento 2025.jpeg" alt="Evento 2025.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Então segue a apresentação do conteúdo do SIT Londrina 2025, em formato "Live":&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FNcAlhFdOR5A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNcAlhFdOR5A&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FNcAlhFdOR5A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="400" height="225" scrolling="no" title="Segurança em Aplicações/Serviços no BTP em épocas de IA - SIT Londrina 2025" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Mas se ainda não se contextualizou, sugiro antes de assistir o material acima ler todo o conteúdo abaixo e entender a evolução até o evento SIT Londrina 2025, ok?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Se você não conhece SAP e chegou até aqui, segue um pequeno resumo:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;SAP é um software de gestão empresarial usado pelas maiores e mais importantes empresas do mundo para integrar e otimizar processos de negócios cruciais, como finanças e logística. Ele centraliza dados para fornecer uma visão completa e em tempo real, permitindo decisões estratégicas mais rápidas e eficientes. A sua importância reside em ser uma espinha dorsal tecnológica que garante a eficiência e a competitividade global dessas corporações.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No evento, realizei a apresentação “Segurança em Aplicações/Serviços no BTP em épocas de IA” sobre Cyber Security no mundo SAP, para aplicações desenvolvidas em um modelo bem específico. Mas com esse post aqui, o objetivo é atingir e disponibilizar o conteúdo a todos da comunidade SAP, bem como os curiosos e interessados pelo tema de segurança da informação. Como muitos podem estar lendo pela primeira vez sobre o tema e o que eu já fiz até então, vou detalhar a historia desde o começo de uma maneira resumida até chegar no SIT Londrina 2025, ok?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tudo começou na Pandemia, no ano de 2020/2021, onde estava fazendo uma pesquisa para um blog que iria escrever sobre um tutorial de um tipo desenvolvimento Web especifico (SAPUI5) . Esse tutorial seria sobre o desenvolvimento de aplicações UI5/FIORI ao publico B2C, ou seja usuários que em sua maioria nunca teriam visto nada sobre SAP e que para eles seria como uma aplicação Web qualquer, também aplicações essas que seriam disponibilizadas na internet para acesso do publico em geral. No Blog eu iria abordar a arquitetura recomendada, exemplos de códigos fonte, etc., porém na etapa de pesquisa para apresentar alguns “exemplos” já existentes no mercado, me deparei com cenários muito assustadores!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Para contextualizar, “o sistema SAP” sempre é em sua maioria um sistema “fechado”, onde o acesso é feito geralmente por quem de fato precisa do mesmo (até por questão de custo de licença). Analisando a minha experiencia, de colegas e muitos estudos, conseguia afirmar então que os profissionais que desenvolvem, desenham e/ou especificam soluções SAP ao “publico geral”, em sua maioria não tem uma preocupação com os quesitos de segurança. No mundo SAP, os desenvolvimentos geralmente ficam dentro do sistema e/ou na rede interna do cliente, então esse tópico nunca foi muito explorado pelos profissionais e consultorias que desenvolvem soluções customizadas, e esse aqui foi o principal motivador de iniciar todo o conteúdo. Ou seja, profissionais do mundo SAP precisam se atentar e se preparar ao criar soluções desse tipo, pois os impactos de não fazer algo correto podem ser enormes (que verá logo mais alguns exemplos). Pois se algum desses casos caísse nas mãos erradas, não só a imagem da empresa em questão que usa SAP, independente do país que está localizada, seria impactada com prejuízos financeiros e até implicações legais, mas nós profissionais do mundo SAP também seriamos impactados pela “imagem” que seria passada que o sistema SAP é de alguma maneira "inseguro".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Antes de entrarmos no detalhe tenho que falar algo importante, tudo que falarei daqui em diante diz respeito a &lt;STRONG&gt;aplicações/serviços customizados&lt;/STRONG&gt; e &lt;U&gt;não standard SAP&lt;/U&gt;, ou seja foram soluções desenvolvidas por alguém para atender o requisito daquele cliente em específico, e não algo que “vem” no produto SAP. Soluções SAP a nível de produto no geral são muitos seguras, onde a mesma investe muito para manter o mais alto nível de segurança, utilizando todas as ferramentas e métodos de mercado para tal. Até ter programas onde pode “contratar” profissionais de cyber segurança para tentar explorar e descobrir como deixar seus produtos mais seguros (onde eu posso ou não ter participado. NDA). Recomendo os links &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/security.html%20" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/A&gt; e &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/what-is-cybersecurity.html%20" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/A&gt; para quem deseja se aprofundar mais no tema de segurança no nível de produto SAP. Outro ponto importante, é que demonstro como essas aplicações customizadas podem ser facilmente encontradas na internet por ferramentas como Google Buscador.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Na pesquisa fui encontrando muitas empresas vulneráveis em um numero altíssimo, quase podendo afirmar que mais 30% das que encontrei, tinham algum problema. Então o que era um tutorial mudou para uma pesquisa mais aprofundada do tema, e com isso resolvi criar o movimento &lt;A href="https://safesapui5.web.app/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;#SafeSAPUI5&lt;/A&gt;. Que basicamente iniciaria com a criação de material e conscientização dos profissionais para termos aplicações e serviços SAP seguros que estão expostos na internet. Pois aqui entra um detalhe técnico bem agravante, para muitos casos o requerimento do cliente (ou seja, o que ele precisa) é ter uma aplicação customizada porem sem ter a necessidade de &lt;STRONG&gt;nenhum tipo de autenticação&lt;/STRONG&gt; por parte do usuário que vai acessar. Ou seja, ao clicar na URL ele já deve entrar na aplicação customizada e poder fazer a ação necessária, cenário esse que foge bem do “padrão” SAP e existem muitas e &lt;U&gt;muitas aplicações como essa espalhadas pelo mundo&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Os materiais do #SafeSAPUI5 podem ser encontrados &lt;A href="https://safesapui5.web.app/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;aqui&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Além dos mesmos, como já estava pronto para escrever, resolvi criar um Ebook gratuito sobre o tema, juntando um pouco de historia, exemplos, dicas e casos reais. Com isso, nasceu o ebook UI5 Hacker, que pode ser encontrado gratuitamente &lt;A href="https://ui5hacker.web.app/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;aqui&lt;/A&gt; (Português e Inglês).&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Juntando tudo isso apresentei a primeira palestra do tema, ainda na Pandemia, no evento UI5 Con 2021 (em Inglês) que é a conferencia global de SAPUI5, biblioteca utilizada para realizar esses desenvolvimentos (mais detalhes na palestra ou ebook).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;UI5CON 2021: #SafeSAPUI5:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FIyLPftaF8CA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIyLPftaF8CA&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FIyLPftaF8CA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="400" height="225" scrolling="no" title="#SafeSAPUI5" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Depois da mesma, com a ajuda da própria SAP, consegui espalhar essa conscientização e também comunicar os clientes ao redor do mundo que estavam inseguros e foram citados nos exemplos da palestra e ebook (alguns com vulnerabilidades muito graves, como cópia do passaporte de todos os usuários pronta para ser extraída por exemplo). Importante, era possível conseguir isso sem precisar realizar nenhum tipo de hack, apenas saber executar um serviço/API que está exposto na internet (até pelo próprio navegador).&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Então em 2023, resolvi fazer um compilado do material de 2021 em Português (com alguns novos exemplos) e apresentar no SIT SP 2023 (Serviços Seguros &amp;amp; Aplicações Seguras), trazendo a tona novamente o material e o tema (agora focado mais em Português).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A palestra pode ser vista no Youtube aqui:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FrBvyOuJZDHA%3Fstart%3D2219%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D2219&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrBvyOuJZDHA&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FrBvyOuJZDHA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="400" height="225" scrolling="no" title="Serviços Seguros &amp;amp; Aplicações Seguras (BTP, FIORI, S/4 e Segurança da Informação)" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Com isso tive muitos feedbacks positivos de profissionais e de clientes SAP que resolveram suas vulnerabilidades e passaram a adotar as praticas em seu dia a dia, para esse e outros requisitos. Mas é importante falar, &lt;STRONG&gt;é possível SIM&lt;/STRONG&gt; fazer uma aplicação WEB como essa que descrevi acima de maneira segura e protegida para o seu cliente, só seguir as boas praticas e utilizar as ferramentas corretas. Acontece que nesse "meio tempo", a adoção do &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP&lt;/A&gt; (oferta da SAP de serviços Cloud, assim como os outros grandes players de tecnologia) cresceu exponencialmente no mundo todo. Se iniciou então um movimento de muitos clientes para levarem suas soluções para o BTP (conhecido como o movimento “move to cloud”), e alguns deles com aplicações se enquadrando nas possíveis vulnerabilidades descritas.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mas e então, apenas levar as aplicações ao BTP as deixam seguras?&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;E com a chegada, popularização e massiva utilização/evolução das &lt;A href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelig%C3%AAncia_artificial" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Inteligências Artificiais (IAs)&lt;/A&gt; impactam nisso tudo?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Para responder as questões acima e trazer a tona novamente o tema, resolvi criar o material da palestra apresentada no SIT Londrina 2025: “Segurança em Aplicações/Serviços no BTP em épocas de IA”. Mas como comentei antes, o evento foi somente presencial e por conta disso resolvi realizar uma “live” com o mesmo material e conteúdo para disponibilizar a todos o mesmo. Colocando em uma linha do tempo então, ficaria assim:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="MKT.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305145i1798EC4FADAC8DCB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MKT.png" alt="MKT.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;O PDF do material apresentado no SIT Londrina 2025 pode ser encontrado &lt;A href="http://tiny.cc/SITLON2025" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;aqui&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Após a apresentação desse material (PDF e "Live"), demonstro que uma simples ida ao SAP BTP com aplicações nesse modelo não te deixará mais seguro. E com a chegada das IAs, existe hoje uma rápida revolução no segmento de Cyber Security (assim como o mundo em geral) que as empresas que utilizam soluções SAP devem estar atentas e preparadas.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Espero que tenha gostado do conteúdo e lhe ajudado, e que de alguma maneira tenha agregando algo ao seu conhecimento atual.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Obrigado e nos vemos nas próximas aventuras do “Hacker do Bem”.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This sixth post in my series gives an overview of user experience innovations in SAP Customer Experience and SAP Concur. For SAP Customer Experience, look at the new AI agents and the capability to build custom agents, plus AI innovations for marketeers in SAP Emarsys, and Joule and AI order summaries in SAP Sales Cloud Version 2. &amp;nbsp;SAP Concur takes travel planning to the next level with the whole new travel experience, complemented by the new Joule Booking Agent enabling users to use natural language to book a trip.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before reading this, do read the first blog post introducing the series and providing general information about Joule and central entry points and services, along with links to all the published parts of this blog post series:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1609675603"&gt;SAP Customer Experience&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The user experience highlights I have picked are all AI-related:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI Agents.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Emarsys UX innovations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Sales Cloud Version 2 UX innovations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This news article summarizes what’s new overall for SAP Customer Experience, beyond UX-related innovations:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2025/07/connected-growth-sap-cx-q2-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Connected for Growth: What’s New with SAP Customer Experience in Q2 2025&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1542244817"&gt;AI Agents&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As I explained in part 1 of this series, AI agents work in the background to give a greatly enhanced user experience. A number of powerful AI agents are available for SAP Customer Experience, via the package &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ai-catalog/?packages=cc485586-3c5c-427b-a3d1-12b0bb138229&amp;amp;aiType=ai_agent_package" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Joule Premium for Customer Experience&lt;/A&gt;. This blog post and video give a nice overview of three of them in action:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/ai-agents-in-action/ba-p/14073817" target="_blank"&gt;AI Agents in Action&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Video: &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2025/01/b8dba82e-f27e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;See How AI Agents Streamline Customer Service&lt;/A&gt; (3:11 min.)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The latest UX innovations are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Shopping Agent for the Shopping Assistant.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Digital Service Agent (via Early Adopter Care program).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ability to create custom agents in the CX AI Toolkit.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1474814031"&gt;AI Shopping Agent for the SAP Commerce Cloud Shopping Assistant&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The shopping agent helps customers when visiting an online shop: they can simply use natural language to state what they are looking for, and the shopping agent will respond with suitable suggestions. Figure 1 shows an example, where the user starts out by stating that they are looking for shoes to wear for two mile long walks while wearing a suit. Two shoes are suggested, and the user asks which one is comfortable right away, since he doesn’t want a long break in period. The agent recommends one model, and the customer then asks for a recommendation for a belt to match, which the agent promptly gives him.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: Shopping Agent for the Shopping Assistant from SAP Commerce Cloud.

It enables customers to ask questions with natural language and provides answers based on your company’s business knowledge residing in the SAP system. Hence, it is able to resolve common inquiries and issues, giving customers a good experience. Furthermore, by freeing up you sales and service team to focus on more complex inquiries, your customers will also receive a better service and hence better experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The digital serice agent is currently only available for select customers via the Early Adopter Care program. Figure 2 in the next section shows how these customers can select it in the AI Agent Builder.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find out more here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Discovery Center: &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ai-feature/9bd66628-12f0-46f7-b9d7-ce4ff725a946/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Digital Service Agent&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1081787021"&gt;Create Custom Agents with CX AI Toolkit&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can now create your own custom agents with the CX AI toolkit.

And if you just need to book one item, you can do that very easily now with the new Booking Agent powered by Joule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--468662886"&gt;New Concur Travel Experience&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When travelling for a few days, one often needs to book more than one item. A typical combination is booking a flight, a hotel and a rental car. Up until now, you have had to book each item separately and take care that the dates and time match. Now, with the new Concur Travel experience, planning and booking is much easier: you can enter the start and end dates for your flight, and the new feature &lt;EM&gt;Match Flight Booking&lt;/EM&gt; is applied to the hotel and car, so that dates and time match automatically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figures 7 to 11 show what this looks like: Figure 7 shows the start screen, where you select which items you want to include (flight, hotel, car, train). Figure 8 shows the flight view, where flight dates have been entered. Figure 9 shows the hotel search, with the default selection “Based on flight selection”, and similarly Figure 10 shows the rental car search, with pick-up and return times calculated based on the flight schedule. Figure 11 shows the finalize screen, in this case showing that the flight and hotel has been selected but the rental car is still open.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 7: New Concur Travel experience start screen.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This seventh and last post in my series gives an overview innovations in our UI tools and technologies, making it ever easier to design, build and integrate UIs, for both web and mobile applications. For designing apps, web and mobile, we have a new SAP Design System portal and UI Kits in Figma. For developers, we have added further AI assistance, as well as many individual improvements, including support for the latest international accessibility standard WCAG 2.2. &lt;EM&gt;Fun fact: SAPUI5 is now used on all 7 continents – yes, Antarctica too!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before reading this, do read the first blog post introducing the series and providing general information about Joule and central entry points and services, along with links to all the published parts of this blog post series:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The above post also gives an update on building your own Joule agents, so I will not cover that here, but rather focus on web and mobile UI development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1609793836"&gt;Design News&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1542363050"&gt;SAP Design System Portal and UI Kits in Figma&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We recently introduced the new &lt;A href="http://www.sap.com/design-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Design System portal&lt;/A&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;that &lt;/SPAN&gt;brings together the product design guidelines SAP Fiori for web, SAP Fiori for iOS, and SAP Fiori for Android, as well as to the new digital design system guidelines.

Adopting the latest standards gives applications a true cutting edge, ensuring that solutions are inclusive and meet the diverse needs of users globally.&amp;nbsp;When creating apps with SAP Build and SAPUI5, developers can leverage the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, two of the key new requirements in the 2.2 version are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The minimum target size of an interactive element now needs to be 24x24 px, so that users don’t accidentally activate a neighbouring element.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Each operation that can be performed by dragging can also be performed alternatively without dragging – so that people who cannot use a mouse to drag can still use the UI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;See more details:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sapui5-is-leading-the-way-in-accessibility-with-wcag-2-2/ba-p/14101596" target="_blank"&gt;SAPUI5 is Leading the Way in Accessibility with WCAG 2.2&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-166768515"&gt;SAP Fiori tools – open source, faster app creation, more AI&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most powerful recent innovations is the AI-powered project accelerator from SAP Fiori tools, which allows you to create a fully functional app with database tables, CDS-Views, OData service and a Fiori element list report UI based on a sketch of what you want. I introduced this in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q1-2025-update-part-7-ui-design-and-technology-for-web/ba-p/14034290" target="_blank"&gt;my Q1 update post&lt;/A&gt; from March. This can now be started from Joule in SAP Build Code. Also, it has been further enhanced, and is also available as open source, so that our developer community can make contributions themselves.

I have picked two enhancements to highlight here for developers using SAPUI5 and SAP Fiori elements on OData V4, which are covered in the following subsections:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support for inline edit for object pages.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support for the analytical table on the object page.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--172407145"&gt;Support for inline edit for object pages&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can now develop object pages where users can directly edit fields within facets, without having to first press the “Edit” button and go into edit mode. Figure 5 shows an example from a test application.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 5: Inline editing of fields in an object page with SAP Fiori elements for OData V4.

Now, developers using SAPUI5 and SAP Fiori elements on OData V4 can include an analytical table into one of the facets of an object page. Figure 6 shows an example.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 6: Analytical table in an object page with SAP Fiori elements for OData V4.

If you have any trouble with this example mission, post in the comments.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;REMINDER:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The above is just an example of how the real scavenger hunt will work.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We’re excited to announce the &lt;STRONG&gt;release of the SAP Fiori MCP server&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a new capability that lets AI coding assistants directly create and edit &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fiori applications. This marks the next milestone in our AI journey, following the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/from-idea-to-app-using-ai-powered-project-accelerator-to-develop-sap-fiori/ba-p/14095300" target="_blank"&gt;Project Accelerator&lt;/A&gt; introduced earlier this year. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What is MCP — and why it matters?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; is an &lt;A href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;open standard&lt;/A&gt; that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models. MCP is already supported by clients such as Claude, Cline, Cursor, and VS Code allowing AI-powered workflows to interact seamlessly with developer tools.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introducing the SAP Fiori MCP server&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP Fiori MCP server (&lt;A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap-ux/fiori-mcp-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;@sap-ux/fiori-mcp-server&lt;/A&gt;) is an open-source node.js module delivered as part of the &lt;STRONG&gt;open-ux-tools &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP/open-ux-tools/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;repository&lt;/A&gt;. It enables developers using AI coding assistants to generate and adapt SAP Fiori elements applications with precision and context awareness. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It is not the only MCP server published by SAP. The &lt;STRONG&gt;CAP MCP server&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cap-js/mcp-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;@cap-js/mcp-server&lt;/A&gt;) provides tools to create and modify CAP node.js projects, and the &lt;STRONG&gt;UI5 MCP server&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/mcp-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;@ui5/mcp-server&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; allows AI assistants to write SAPUI5&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; code. Together, these servers provide complementary entry points into different areas of SAP application development, so that AI assistants can seamlessly &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;data models, SAP Fiori applications, and SAPUI5 code.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For more information also have a look at the related blog posts:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/boost-your-cap-development-with-ai-introducing-the-mcp-server-for-cap/ba-p/14202849" target="_self"&gt;Boost your CAP Development with AI: Introducing the MCP Server for CAP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/give-your-ai-agent-some-tools-introducing-the-ui5-mcp-server/ba-p/14200825" target="_self"&gt;Give Your AI Agent Some Tools: Introducing the UI5 MCP Server&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the MCP servers in place, you can already try out scenarios such as:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Please add an SAP Fiori elements list report app to my CAP project.”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Generate a new CAP project and SAP Fiori app based on my_sketch.png.”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Add Flexible Column Layout to the app.”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Enable initial load for the SAP Fiori app.”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;⚠&lt;SPAN&gt;️ &lt;EM&gt;Note: The SAP Fiori MCP server is currently released in &lt;STRONG&gt;experimental state&lt;/STRONG&gt; and subject to rapid change and enhancements.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI assistants can discover and act on SAP Fiori projects&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first release comes with a set of capabilities designed to let AI assistants both discover and act on SAP Fiori projects. The SAP Fiori MCP server provides tools to generate SAP Fiori elements applications for CAP node.js projects, finds SAP Fiori applications in the workspace, and allows to edit applications and pages inside applications. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To ensure that the AI produces correct results, we propose rules that guide the LLM’s behavior (see &lt;A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap-ux/fiori-mcp-server#rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;rules&lt;/A&gt;). These rules cover important aspects such as using proper SAP Fiori elements application patterns, ensuring data models are valid with UUID primary keys, generating sample data consistently, and preferring code-based modifications over screen personalization. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can configure the server to be directly called with npx or install it globally via npm (see &lt;A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap-ux/fiori-mcp-server#usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;usage&lt;/A&gt;). In both cases, it integrates easily into an MCP-enabled client such as Cline.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Example how the SAP Fiori MCP server is used in Cline." style="width: 765px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/308017iA55B99B19DAD23CD/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Christoph_Gollmick_1-1756821532142.png" alt="Example how the SAP Fiori MCP server is used in Cline." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Example how the SAP Fiori MCP server is used in Cline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Developers can build apps more quickly using MCP servers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By connecting directly into SAP Fiori projects through MCP, developers gain a much more cost-effective way to experiment with AI support. They can let LLMs execute complex tasks in context—while the built-in functions and rules ensure adherence to SAP Fiori best practices. This reduces the risk of hallucinations, accelerates prototyping, and makes it easier to iterate quickly on new ideas. Since the SAP Fiori MCP server is &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;with other MCP servers like UI5 and CAP, developers can benefit from a consistent AI-driven experience across different parts of the development process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This is the first step on the MCP journey&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The current release is just the first step. We are already working on extending the server with a &lt;STRONG&gt;document search feature&lt;/STRONG&gt; that will make guidance from SAP documentation, tutorials, and examples directly available to the LLM. This means that the AI assistant won’t just follow rules embedded in the server but can also draw from the wealth of published learning content.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In addition, the &lt;STRONG&gt;generator functionality&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which in the first release is limited to CAP node.js projects, will be expanded to support &lt;STRONG&gt;any suitable OData source&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This will significantly broaden the scenarios in which the SAP Fiori MCP server can be applied, giving developers much more flexibility in how they use AI to create and adapt applications.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Try the SAP Fiori MCP server at SAP TechEd 2025&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can experience the SAP Fiori MCP server live at &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP TechEd Berlin&lt;/STRONG&gt;. In session &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1749126322451001Fcbi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CA261 – Create great UX with AI, SAP Design System, SAP Fiori elements, and SAPUI5&lt;/A&gt;, we’ll guide you through using AI and MCP to generate applications, adapt them, and extend them with SAPUI5. It’s a hands-on workshop designed to show how these new capabilities come together in practice.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Closing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This release marks the start of a new era in SAP Fiori development, where AI assistants can not only suggest but also execute tasks reliably. With upcoming enhancements like doc search and broader generator support, we’re laying the groundwork for &lt;STRONG&gt;smarter, faster, and more flexible AI-driven development&lt;/STRONG&gt;. As an open-source project we also welcome your contributions. We encourage you to report any issues you encounter. Your feedback is invaluable to us.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We can’t wait to see how you experiment with it—and we look forward to meeting you at TechEd!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

They’re not just decorative—they’re purposeful, designed to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Simplify complex concepts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Create emotional connection&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Guide users through unfamiliar workflows&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Add personality to otherwise sterile enterprise screens&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These illustrations are typically paired with messages in empty states, onboarding flows, error pages, or help dialogs. Think of them as visual metaphors that make abstract ideas more relatable.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1691769952"&gt;Why Are They Necessary?&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s why illustrations are more than just eye candy in SAP UI5:&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="2025-09-04_22-38-40.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309460iFA230496BBD3BEF3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="2025-09-04_22-38-40.png" alt="2025-09-04_22-38-40.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1624339166"&gt;1. Improved Comprehension&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Visuals help users grasp concepts faster than text alone. For example, an illustration of a magnifying glass next to a “No results found” message instantly conveys the idea of search failure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1427825661"&gt;2. Emotional Engagement&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enterprise apps can feel impersonal. Illustrations add warmth and friendliness, making users feel more comfortable and confident—even when something goes wrong.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1231312156"&gt;3. Consistency Across SAP Fiori Design&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP UI5 illustrations follow the SAP Fiori Guidelines&amp;nbsp;ensuring a consistent look and feel across apps. This consistency builds trust and reduces cognitive load.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1034798651"&gt;4. Accessibility and Inclusivity&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Illustrations can support users with different language proficiencies or cognitive styles. When paired with clear text, they make the interface more inclusive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-838285146"&gt;5. Guided User Journeys&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;In onboarding or help flows, illustrations act as visual signposts. They guide users step-by-step, reducing friction and improving adoption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-512688922"&gt;Common Misuses to Avoid&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP’s guidelines emphasize that illustrations should never:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Be used purely for decoration&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Obstruct the user’s path&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Replace essential information&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;They should always support the message, not distract from it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-316175417"&gt;️How to Use Them in SAP UI5&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP UI5 provides a set of predefined &lt;FONT color="#0000FF"&gt;illustrations&lt;/FONT&gt; via the sap.f library. Developers can easily integrate them using controls like I&lt;FONT color="#0000FF"&gt;llustratedMessage&lt;/FONT&gt;, which combines an image, title, and description in a clean layout.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example usage:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sap.f.IllustratedMessage
    illustrationType="sapIllus-NoData"
    title="No Data Available"
    description="Try adjusting your filters or check back later." /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-248744631"&gt;UI5 API Reference for Illustration&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--445485969"&gt;&lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.Illustration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.m.Illustration&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--641999474"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Illustration Samples&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.IllustratedMessage/sample/sap.m.sample.IllustratedMessageInPageTNT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.IllustratedMessage/sample/sap.m.sample.IllustratedMessageInPageTNT&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
