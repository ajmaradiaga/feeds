    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="flyd-zAhAUSdRLJ8-unsplash.jpg" style="width: 800px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/273155i92CE2F1EF6A6D165/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="flyd-zAhAUSdRLJ8-unsplash.jpg" alt="flyd-zAhAUSdRLJ8-unsplash.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Heard about those big cyber-attacks recently? No names needed, but chances are, your weekly shop has been hit. The interesting thing is that they followed a familiar pattern. Security analysts found that over 52,000 new vulnerabilities were disclosed in 2024, indicating that outdated or misconfigured systems are a growing invitation to attackers (sentinelone.com). Hackers often slip in via a ‘side door’: an unpatched server, an ill-configured cloud service, or a tricked user giving up a password. Another analysis of supply-chain incidents found that about half were driven by stolen or weak credentials (securityinfowatch.com). In plain terms, cybercrooks lean on low-hanging fruit - phishing, reused passwords, forgotten updates , more than any sci-fi-style hack.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Naturally, this has SAP customers asking: “Are our own SAP BTP environments secure? Is our user management tight? Are we following cloud security best practices?” These are great questions, and we’ve been hearing them a lot. So in this blog post we tried to answer these burning questions. We will address everything from locking down user accounts to broader security best practices, and we promise it won’t be a parade of jargon or doom-and-gloom.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1732355204"&gt;What can we learn from the recent cyber-attacks in the UK?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The recent cyber-attacks targeting major UK retailers mark a significant moment in cyber security as these are among the first Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks to penetrate networks that were protected by enterprise-grade firewalls. In many cases, these firewalls are managed by hyper scalars such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, who provide the foundational infrastructure.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, it’s important to recognise that responsibility for security is shared. There’s a fine line between what the hyper scaler secures and what platform providers, like SAP BTP or Microsoft Power Platform, are responsible for. Most organisations today operate across multiple platforms, each with its own security model, tools, and SLAs, which can lead to gaps in the overall defence posture if not carefully managed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s also a reminder of the real-world consequences of cybersecurity failures. When breaches occur, especially those involving customer data, organisations face not just supply chain or reputational damage, but significant financial penalties under regulations like GDPR. We’ve seen this play out repeatedly, including with major social media companies in recent years.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;These all point to the importance of a well-coordinated, multi-layered security approach. It’s got to be holistic and span infrastructure, platforms, and application layers, with clear roles and responsibilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1535841699"&gt;How secure is SAP BTP out of the box, and what are the most common gaps you see in customer configurations?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, that’s the approach, but how is this carried out? The&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://bluestonex.com/knowledge-bank/the-ultimate-guide-to-sap-btp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Business Technology Platform&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;is designed with security and governance in mind across multiple layers. Out of the box, SAP BTP offers:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Built&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;‑&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;in Identity &amp;amp; Access Management (IAM) &amp;amp; Network Security:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Native support for Single Sign On(SSO) /Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Role Based Access Control(RBAC), and the SAP Authorisation Management service. Only authorised users and roles can access each sub-account or application.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Encryption &amp;amp; Transport Security:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;All user traffic is TLS-encrypted&amp;nbsp;, and SAP exclusively establishes encrypted communication channels by default.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitoring &amp;amp; Audit:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP BTP automatically logs admin and user activities. The Cloud Foundry&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Audit Log Viewer&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;service lets you review all operations (applications created, users added, etc.), and connect these logs as desired.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Secure Development Tools:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP’s Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and other frameworks include built-in security guards (XSRF tokens, JWT checks, etc.), plus tools like the SAP Code Vulnerability Analyser (CVA) that statically scan ABAP code on SAP BTP before deployment.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, despite this strong foundation, we often see gaps in how customers configure their environments. The most common issues include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bypassing SAP BTP Connectivity Guidelines&lt;/STRONG&gt; Customers sometimes integrate third-party APIs or services directly, without using the secure connectivity mechanisms provided by SAP BTP. This can create vulnerabilities and reduce visibility over traffic flows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improper Credential Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; Instead of using SAP BTP’s built-in credential stores, credentials are sometimes hardcoded or stored in less secure ways, leaving applications open to compromise.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Neglecting Secure App Design Principles&lt;/STRONG&gt; Applications are not always developed using the security best practices. This can lead to poor access controls, exposure to common vulnerabilities, or lack of proper authorisation checks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While SAP BTP provides a secure foundation, maintaining a strong security posture requires careful configuration and adherence to recommended best practices, particularly when it comes to connectivity, credential management, and application architecture.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1339328194"&gt;How to prevent similar attacks when running business-critical workloads on SAP BTP?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To safeguard business-critical workloads on SAP BTP, a few key practices should be followed:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Use SAP Services for All Integrations:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ensure every integration and API call goes through SAP’s connectivity and security layers. Use the SAP Destination Service, API Management, and the Cloud Connector/Connectivity Service, rather than hard‑coding endpoints. This way, TLS is enforced and flows are logged and constrained. (Think of&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://bluestonex.com/service/sap-btp-partner-managed-cloud/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP services&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;like a secure gateway that you should not bypass.)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication Everywhere:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Require MFA for all user logins – not just admins. SAP Cloud Identity Service (or your corporate IdP) can enforce MFA policies on every SAP BTP access. SAP’s TechEd guide even walks through configuring MFA for SAP BTP apps. This means stolen passwords alone won’t give attackers an easy in.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Harden IAM and Accounts:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Follow the principle of least privilege. Regularly audit user roles and prune any unused or generic accounts. Disable any unused features like self-registration or social sign-on. Use roles and groups in your Identity Provider (IdP) to ensure people only get the permissions needed for their job.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor and Respond to Logs:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Subscribing to the SAP Audit Log Viewer (for Cloud Foundry (CF)) is critical. Review logs periodically for anomalies (e.g. logins from new locations, sudden privilege grants). Configure alerts or integrate these logs into your Security Information &amp;amp; Event Management(SIEM). Quick detection can stop an incident in its tracks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even doing just these steps drastically cuts risk. In effect,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;you’re closing the ‘side doors’&lt;/STRONG&gt;: every inbound or outbound connection is tracked by SAP, every user action is logged, and strong authentication blocks the common tricks that took down those retailers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1142814689"&gt;What role does identity and access management play in defending against modern cyber threats in SAP environments?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Identity and Access Management (IAM) is the keystone of SAP BTP security. SAP BTP supports a full identity lifecycle and fine-grained authorisation model:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;You define roles or role collections in your SAP BTP sub-accounts (and business roles in the ABAP environment) that grant only needed permissions. Then you assign these roles to users/groups. This enforces&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;least privilege&lt;/EM&gt;, so even if a user’s credentials are compromised, the attacker’s access is limited.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Trusted Identity Providers:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;BTP can federate with SAP Cloud Identity (Identity Authentication Service) or any SAML/OAuth IdP. Once trust is set up, employees authenticate with corporate credentials (with MFA, if you’ve enforced it). This ensures a single point of control over user accounts and policies. IAM integrates with identity providers and defines roles and permissions to secure applications and data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Principal Propagation:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;When a user calls between SAP systems (for example, a CF app calling an ABAP endpoint), their identity and roles “travel” with the request. This maintains security boundaries across services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;IAM practices help organisations enforce strict access boundaries, maintain compliance, and defend against unauthorised access—whether from external attackers or internal misconfigurations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-946301184"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How can organisations balance innovation on SAP BTP with the need for robust security and compliance?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Innovation and security are not opposing forces—they must evolve together. As applications built on SAP BTP grow in complexity, the security measures surrounding them must also mature. The more advanced and interconnected your solutions become, the greater the need for enhanced controls, monitoring, and governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Organisations that fail to innovate risk becoming obsolete. But equally, those that innovate without embedding strong security and compliance practices expose themselves to serious vulnerabilities. Every new capability, integration, or user touchpoint introduces potential risks that must be addressed as part of the innovation lifecycle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Training is also key. Ensure developers and admins know SAP BTP best practices. Ignorance may be bliss, but it also breeds vulnerabilities, since human error is often the weakest link. If all personal interacting with the platform are aware of the threats, they can help mitigate them but also spot them. Make security part of your culture and process – every innovation needs to come with corresponding security guardrails.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sustainable innovation on SAP BTP requires a security-first mindset—where governance, compliance, and threat prevention are integrated into every phase of development and deployment.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-749787679"&gt;Securing your innovation on SAP BTP&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The recent cyber-attacks serve as a stark reminder that even the most well-defended systems are not immune to evolving and opportunistic threats. For organisations leveraging SAP BTP to drive innovation, the message is clear: security must be treated as a continuous discipline, not a one-time checklist.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While SAP BTP provides a strong out-of-the-box security framework, real resilience comes from how that framework is implemented, monitored, and adapted. From enforcing secure connectivity and managing access intelligently, to following coding best practices and monitoring audit logs—every detail matters.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To conclude, the balance between innovation and security is not a compromise; it’s a partnership. With the right governance, identity management, and adherence to best practices, organisations can confidently build and scale on SAP BTP—without sacrificing trust, compliance, or control.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Please feel free to share your experiences and thoughts on the similar approaches you might have taken securing your applications on SAP BTP in the comments section.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1734053448"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introduction&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI is SAP’s solution for &lt;STRONG&gt;secure authentication and single sign-on in SAP GUI scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The service is based on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) and supports the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/resilience-high-availability-and-disaster-recovery?version=Cloud" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;platform capabilities for high availability&lt;/A&gt; (HA).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In most cases this will be sufficient for customers, in particular as SAP Secure Login Service is only required during an end-user’s initial authentication of the day. When this is successful, an X.509 certificate is deployed on the end-user desktop, which gives her single sign-on, usually for the rest of the working day. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Still, some customers would like to go beyond the standard HA capabilities and instead &lt;STRONG&gt;implement a dedicated, multi-region failover setup&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this blog, I will describe the steps that are necessary to configure this setup. It is based on SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI, SAP Custom Domain service and Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager. Many thanks to Microsoft’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/171519"&gt;@MartinRaepple&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for helping me get started with Traffic Manager. This blog is yet another outcome of our great collaboration over the years &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1537539943"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Setting up SAP Secure Login Service for multi-region failover&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SLS HA Setup.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/280678iC2ABAAF0553513B0/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SLS HA Setup.png" alt="SLS HA Setup.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Subscribe to SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI from &lt;STRONG&gt;two SAP BTP subaccounts&lt;/STRONG&gt; in different regions, in the same global account. Let us assume that the two instances of SAP Secure Login Service have the URLs sls-customer.region1.cloud.sap and sls-customer.region2.cloud.sap.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;In each region, configure the same &lt;STRONG&gt;custom domain&lt;/STRONG&gt; and map it to the local SAP Secure Login Service standard route. Let us assume that the custom domain has the URL sls.customer.com. For the custom domain to work, you also need to add the OpenID Connect redirect URIs in SAP Cloud Identity Services – Identity Authentication.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Introduce a traffic management solution. In this example, we use &lt;STRONG&gt;Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Let us assume that the Traffic Manager profile has the URL sls.trafficmanager.net. Add the URLs of the two SAP Secure Login Service instances as endpoints to the Traffic Manager profile.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure the &lt;STRONG&gt;routing method&lt;/STRONG&gt;, based on which Traffic Manager will switch end points. For testing, you might use the priority of the end points, which means that the switch takes place if you change the priority in the Traffic Manager configuration. In a productive scenario, you would choose technical indicators of availability, such as performance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Traffic Manager will automatically configure the DNS record of sls.trafficmanager.net to point to the optimal endpoint, based on the routing method. Let us assume that in the beginning this is region 1.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Configure the DNS record of your custom domain&lt;/STRONG&gt; sls.customer.com so that it points to the Traffic Manager URL sls.trafficmanager.net.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enter the custom domain sls.customer.com as the SAP Secure Login Service host name in &lt;STRONG&gt;Secure Login Client&lt;/STRONG&gt; on the end-user desktop.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1341026438"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1144512933"&gt;Handling of the failover case&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SLS HA FailOver.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/280680iAF4721A636DCE79B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SLS HA FailOver.png" alt="SLS HA FailOver.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-upper-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Let us assume that due to some technical reason, SAP Secure Login Service in region 1 becomes unresponsive.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Traffic Manager checks all endpoints at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds) and detects the issue.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Traffic Manager updates the DNS record for sls.trafficmanager.net to point to sls-customer.region2.cloud.sap.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The next time Secure Login Client connects to SAP Secure Login Service, the DNS name sls.customer.com is automatically resolved to point to the service instance in region 2.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-947999428"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-751485923"&gt;Further considerations&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog covers the high-availability setup of SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI. As SAP Secure Login Service relies on an identity provider for end-user authentication, this also needs to be available at runtime. SAP’s identity provider, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services – Identity Authentication, also offers a &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/disaster-recovery-high-availability" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;multi-region setup&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;If you use a 3rd party identity provider, check the documentation of that product to learn more about options for high availability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Secure Login Service issues end-user certificates that enable authentication for SAP NetWeaver ABAP-based systems such as SAP ERP and SAP S/4HANA. During authentication, the X.509 certificate is mapped to a user account in the ABAP system, if the SNC name of that user account matches the subject name of the certificate. In the default implementation of SAP Secure Login Service, information about the region becomes part of the subject name. As a result, switching to a different region breaks the mapping.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are &lt;STRONG&gt;two options to ensure that the SNC mapping remains intact&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use parameters of the SAP Cryptographic Library to &lt;STRONG&gt;strip the region names from the certificate subject&lt;/STRONG&gt; before the mapping takes place. That way, certificates from different regions will match the same SNC name. See note&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/notes/2338952" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2338952&lt;/A&gt; for details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Change the SAP Secure Login Service configuration to &lt;STRONG&gt;use a customer-managed certificate authority&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This gives you the option to customize the subject name of the certificate so that it does not include the BTP region.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-554972418"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-358458913"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Setting up SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI for multi-region failover is easy. All you need is SAP Custom Domain service and a traffic management solution such as Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager. Thanks to the flexibility of the configuration, end-users continue to benefit from single sign-on even if SAP Secure Login Service instances are switched in the background.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-161945408"&gt;More information&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more information about our SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI solution and to stay up to date on the latest developments, visit &lt;A href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/single-sign-on" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;our topic page in SAP Community&lt;/A&gt;.

    <content>&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1992398534"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;For developers in the SAP BTP ecosystem, the standard path for authentication involves the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Application Router and &lt;STRONG&gt;XSUAA. It's robust and deeply integrated. But what if you need to connect a non-BTP application or simply want to experiment with open standards?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This guide demonstrates how to authenticate a standalone Node.js application directly against SAP Cloud Identity Services (CIS) using a standard &lt;STRONG&gt;OpenID Connect (OIDC) flow. You can try this scenario just for 10 min.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1795885029"&gt;Disclaimer: A Proof-of-Concept, Not a Production BTP Recipe&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;It's crucial to state this upfront: &lt;STRONG&gt;this approach is for educational and validation purposes. For production applications on SAP BTP, the Approuter/XSUAA model remains the recommended best practice. This method is perfect for learning, prototyping, or integrating external apps.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1470288805"&gt;Part 1: Prerequisites - Setting up SAP CIS and Your Local Environment&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before we write any code, we need to configure our identity provider (CIS) and prepare our local machine.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1402858019"&gt;Step 1: Subscribe to Cloud Identity Services&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;First, ensure you have a subscription to the Cloud Identity Services application in your BTP subaccount.

While the Approuter/XSUAA pattern remains the gold standard for integrated BTP solutions, it's empowering to have this flexibility for prototyping and external integrations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I hope this detailed guide helps you connect your own applications.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Shusei, Sekiya&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Did you know that you can find all new feature announcements for SAP Cloud Identity Services in the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/what-s-new-for-identity-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services Release Notes&lt;/A&gt; on the SAP Help Portal? &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let’s take a look at some of our recent highlights! &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1734236933"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Identity Provisioning Service: Job log improvements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Job Execution Outcome&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;is now displayed on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Job Execution Details&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;screen and included in the job notifications. It appears when delta-read jobs and jobs that fail to read entities from the source system affect the deletion of entities in the target system.&lt;BR /&gt;For more information, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/monitor-provisioning-job-logs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Monitor Provisioning Job Logs&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can now download and view the details of all &lt;STRONG&gt;deleted entities by a provisioning job&lt;/STRONG&gt;. To enable this, set the property&amp;nbsp;ips.trace.deleted.entity&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;true&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;For more information, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/manage-provisioning-job-logs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Provisioning Job Logs&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/list-of-properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;List of Properties&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1537723428"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Identity Directory Service and Identity Provisioning Service: Support for extension schemas towards many SAP business applications&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We now support a number of extension schemas, including &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP extension schema for groups&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extension enterprise schema for users&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP ODM User Schema Support&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can find details in the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/what-s-new-for-identity-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Release Notes&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1341209923"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extension of the Identity Directory’s SCIM API &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Identity Directory API of&amp;nbsp;SAP Cloud Identity Services&amp;nbsp;now returns the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;termsOfUse&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;privacyPolicy&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;parameters. For more information, check &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/IdDS_SCIM/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Identity Directory API&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In addition, we now support application-specific group assignments. You can find details in the SAP Help Portal chapters on &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/source-identity-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Identity Authentication&lt;/A&gt; and the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/local-identity-directory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Local Identity Directory&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1144696418"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Management of Corporate Identity Providers via API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Tenant administrators can manage&amp;nbsp;corporate&amp;nbsp;identity providers in Identity Authentication via API. It offers endpoints for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) over the&amp;nbsp;corporate&amp;nbsp;identity providers. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/api/SCI_IdentityProvider_Directory/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services&amp;nbsp;Corporate&amp;nbsp;Identity Providers Directory.&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-948182913"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configuration of Password Expiration Reminder &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You can configure the system to show a&amp;nbsp;password&amp;nbsp;expiration reminder on the user’s sign-in page. For more information, check&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/enable-password-expiration-reminder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Enable&amp;nbsp;Password&amp;nbsp;Expiration Reminder&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-751669408"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enabling SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI with support for Microsoft Windows mandatory profiles&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We added support for single sign-on on shopfloor Windows-based computers that are configured to use a mandatory profile. This protects shopfloor computers with a restrictive mandatory profile while still offering single sign-on support for desktop clients of SAP GUI. You can find more information in the &lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?range=CURRENT-LAST&amp;amp;PRODUCT=AF740456A03F1EDDAA9212F748EDC3E2#Q2%202025;INNO=000D3AAC9DD21FD091EC73B5DC5D34CD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Roadmap Explorer&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-555155903"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Cloud Foundry Login Based on JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When building CI/CD pipelines, developers are responsible for managing the credentials used by these pipelines for authentication to external systems. This traditionally requires developers to take care of the lifecycle of the credentials, including secure storage and regular rotation of the credentials, which comes with repeated efforts and might be error-prone. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In his latest blog post, &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/authenticating-github-actions-workflows-deploying-to-the-sap-btp-cloud/ba-p/14075047" target="_blank"&gt;Authenticating GitHub Actions Workflows Deploying to the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry Environment with JWTs&lt;/A&gt;, Sebastian Ries explains how to authenticate to the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment from a GitHub Actions workflow using GitHub-issued short-lived JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), eliminating the need for manual secret management and enabling secure, efficient CI/CD workflows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Want to stay up to date on our services?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;When you build a CAP (Cloud Application Programming) application on SAP BTP, securing your data and operations is critical. XSUAA (Authorization &amp;amp; Trust Management) helps you manage authentication and &lt;STRONG&gt;role-based access control&lt;/STRONG&gt; (RBAC).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this guide, you’ll learn how to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Define roles in xs-security.json&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Protect your services with CDS annotations&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Check roles manually in Java or Node.js handlers&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Assign roles to users in SAP BTP Cockpit&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1864091214"&gt;1. Define Roles in xs-security.json&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Create an xs-security.json in your project root&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "xsappname": "my-cap-app",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "$XSAPPNAME.Admin",
      "description": "Admin access"
    },
    {
      "name": "$XSAPPNAME.Viewer",
      "description": "Viewer access"
    }
  ],
  "role-templates": [
    {
      "name": "Admin",
      "description": "Admin role",
      "scope-references": ["$XSAPPNAME.Admin"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Viewer",
      "description": "Viewer role",
      "scope-references": ["$XSAPPNAME.Viewer"]
    }
  ]
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Deploy this with your app so XSUAA knows about your roles and scopes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1667577709"&gt;2. Use CDS Annotations to Protect Services&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Add @restrict to your service definitions to declare who can do what.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Example srv/service.cds:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;using { my.namespace as my } from '../db/schema';

service MyService {
  @restrict: [
    { grant: 'READ', to: ['Viewer'] },
    { grant: '*', to: ['Admin'] }
  ]
  entity Products as projection on my.Products;

  entity Orders as projection on my.Orders;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Viewer can only read Products&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Admin can read, insert, update, delete&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;CAP checks the JWT for these scopes automatically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1471064204"&gt;3. Check Roles Without Annotations&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you need custom checks (for example, dynamic rules or complex logic), skip annotations and check in your handler code.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Node.js Example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const cds = require('@sap/cds');

module.exports = cds.service.impl(async function() {
  this.on('READ', 'Products', async (req) =&amp;gt; {
    if (!req.user.is('Admin') &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !req.user.is('Viewer')) {
      return req.reject(403, 'Not authorized');
    }
    return SELECT.from('my.Products');
  });
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Java Example:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ServiceName("MyService")
public class MyServiceHandler implements EventHandler {

  @Before(event = ReadEvent.class, entity = "MyService.Products")
  public void beforeReadProducts(CdsReadEventContext context) {
    UserInfo userInfo = context.getUserInfo();
    if (!userInfo.hasScope("my-cap-app.Admin") &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !userInfo.hasScope("my-cap-app.Viewer")) {
      throw new ServiceException(ErrorStatuses.FORBIDDEN, "Not authorized");
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1274550699"&gt;4. How to Assign Roles to Users in SAP BTP Cockpit&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Defining roles is just step one — you also need to &lt;STRONG&gt;assign them to users&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;Here’s how to do it in short:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go to your &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Subaccount&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Navigate to &lt;STRONG&gt;Security &amp;gt; Role Collections&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find the role collection that includes your Admin or Viewer roles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click &lt;STRONG&gt;Edit&lt;/STRONG&gt;, then &lt;STRONG&gt;Add Users&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Enter the user’s email or ID and save.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the user logs in, their JWT will include the scopes linked to their assigned roles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-948954475"&gt;Final Tips&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Keep your xs-security.json in sync with your service definitions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Use annotations for straightforward restrictions; use handlers for custom logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Test your JWT tokens — tools like Postman or curl help verify scopes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Always bind your app to the XSUAA instance in mta.yaml or default-env.json.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-752440970"&gt;References&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/security-administration-managing-authentication-and-authorization" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Security Administration: Managing Authentication and Authorization&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/security/authorization" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDS-based Authorization&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1994064908"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services (CIS)&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a robust suite of tools designed to manage identity and access across the SAP ecosystem. This blog explores how CIS integrates with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SuccessFactors&lt;/STRONG&gt;, focusing on hybrid integration patterns that enable seamless user authentication and identity provisioning in complex enterprise landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;There are &lt;STRONG&gt;three primary flavors&lt;/STRONG&gt; to integrating&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Standard Integration (Recommended)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Proxy Integration using CIS(external IDP as authentication provider)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Hybrid Integration using CIS (external IDP or both external IDP and CIS as authentication provider) without SF being the source of user records to CIS&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP SuccessFactors with SAP Cloud Identity Services:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1797551403"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Option 1: Integration Between SAP SuccessFactors and SAP CIS (Standard)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide1.PNG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290518i7D24CB293B1CDDD1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide1.PNG" alt="Slide1.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the most recommended method, fully aligned with SAP’s best practices for managing user identities. It involves the following steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integrate&amp;nbsp;SAP SuccessFactors&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;Identity Authentication: Run the upgrade job in the SAP SuccessFactors Upgrade Center to enable features and establish trust between SF and CIS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Confirm that user sync is set up in&amp;nbsp;Identity Provisioning&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;SAP Cloud Identity Services:&amp;nbsp;Set up sync jobs with&amp;nbsp;Identity Provisioning. Ensure that the user that is configured in the&amp;nbsp;Identity Provisioning&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review the default configurations:&amp;nbsp;Review the default configuration of the&amp;nbsp;Identity Authentication&amp;nbsp;service to determine if it meets your requirements or if additional configuration is required.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Additional configuration optional features:Configuration options in&amp;nbsp;Identity Authentication&amp;nbsp;include:&amp;nbsp; Password policy settings, Single sign-on (SSO) etc&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Activate Identity Authentication (IAS): Turn on the&amp;nbsp;Identity Authentication&amp;nbsp;service&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This ensures standardized, low-effort configuration and a consistent integration experience.

Federation can be used if user records exist. Synching user records in CIS unlock features like SAC and future innovations such as SAP Joule, as they're a key prerequisite for access. Ideal for customers wanting minimal disruption to existing identity infrastructure while gaining access to SAP’s innovation roadmap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1404524393"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Option 3: Hybrid Integration — Using SAP CIS as a Proxy Without Standard SF User Sync. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further details in this blog primarily focuses on this &lt;STRONG&gt;hybrid model&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide6.PNG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290527i29BD04C542670248/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide6.PNG" alt="Slide6.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Characteristics:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP SuccessFactors is not the user provisioning source.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CIS can act as a &lt;STRONG&gt;proxy&lt;/STRONG&gt; or both proxy and IDP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;User profile data is synced to CIS from a different /external source to enable:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Access to services like &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Federated authentication via external IdPs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This method provides the flexibility to maintain external Identity manager to keep managing users in an enterprise while using SAP CIS to enabling access to SAP applications and to access new features and innovations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1208010888"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":gear:"&gt;⚙️&lt;/span&gt;Understanding Standard Integration Behavior&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP’s standard SF-to-CIS integration includes &lt;STRONG&gt;two background jobs(in case if SAC exist)&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Job 1: User Sync from SuccessFactors to IAS&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reads user data from SF.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Creates users in CIS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Generates a &lt;STRONG&gt;Global User ID&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and store it in personKeyNav/GlobalUserId in SF.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Populates CustomAttribute1 if the user has SAC access permissions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Job 2: Sync to SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reads user data from SF and syncs only users with access to &lt;STRONG&gt;embedded analytics&lt;/STRONG&gt; to SAC&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Prevents SAC user creation for ineligible accounts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1011497383"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":gear:"&gt;⚙️&lt;/span&gt;Adapting the Integration for an External Data Source&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you're not syncing users from SAP SF (i.e., using an external Data source like Identity manager), the standard jobs need to be customized to use IAS as the source and SAC as the target. It is very important to make sure that only users who have permission to embedded analytics should be synched to SAC. This step can be done either inside the cync job or can be taken care at source level (making sure to populate the custom attribute only if user has permission to access SAC)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":warning:"&gt;⚠️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;EM&gt;To configure this job, you can modify the existing target or create a new one.

SAP CIS supports multiple Subject Name Identifiers (SNI) per application, allowing flexibility. For scenarios where CIS login name is taken by another application as the identifier and it doesn't have the same value as username in SF then any other field supported field can be used for SNI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SuccessFactors (SF)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, it's essential to ensure that the runtime value of the SNI must align with the &lt;STRONG&gt;SF username field&lt;/STRONG&gt; to enable proper user identification.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Expression-based SNI mapping is supported, but functionality is currently limited. Use with caution and review configuration thoroughly before implementation&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide5.PNG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290528iBDB71765879457B7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide5.PNG" alt="Slide5.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2: Can SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) Work Without a Direct Sync from SF to CIS?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, Though it is recommended to sync it from SF&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAC does not require a direct user synchronization from SF&lt;/STRONG&gt;. However, there's a critical requirement to enable user access:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ensure &lt;STRONG&gt;CustomAttribute1&lt;/STRONG&gt; is correctly populated, as it is used to determine analytics access. Regardless of the data source, this attribute must be synced to SAC via CIS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3: Can CustomAttribute1 Be Replaced with Another Attribute?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Absolutely. &lt;STRONG&gt;CustomAttribute1&lt;/STRONG&gt; is just a label. In SAP CIS, custom attributes are internally stored as an array, offering flexibility in how they're used.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you choose to use a different custom attribute:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-circle"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ensure the &lt;STRONG&gt;transformation logic&lt;/STRONG&gt; is updated accordingly, to confirm that &lt;STRONG&gt;consuming applications (e.g., SAC)&lt;/STRONG&gt; are configured to read the new attribute.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Update the &lt;STRONG&gt;SNI mapping&lt;/STRONG&gt; to reference the correct custom attribute.&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide3.PNG" style="width: 849px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290529i5DA6B47FA95724E5/image-dimensions/849x478?v=v2" width="849" height="478" role="button" title="Slide3.PNG" alt="Slide3.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Slide4.PNG" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/290531iED44A7401AC12C91/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Slide4.PNG" alt="Slide4.PNG" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4: Connecting Multiple SF Tenants to a Single CIS Tenant (with SAC for Each SF)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While technically possible, connecting &lt;STRONG&gt;multiple SuccessFactors tenants&lt;/STRONG&gt; to the &lt;STRONG&gt;same CIS tenant,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;each with its own SAC instance, but it is &lt;STRONG&gt;not recommended&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp;This setup introduces significant complexity in&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Managing user states across tenants.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Integrating SAP SuccessFactors with SAP Cloud Identity Services offers flexibility, security, and alignment with SAP’s innovation roadmap. Whether through standard integration or a hybrid identity landscape using external IdPs, these methods empower organizations to centralize access control, reduce redundancy, and prepare for emerging technologies like SAP Joule.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Once created:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Define a service with a function for sending emails in .cds:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;service CatalogService { 
    function sendMail() returns String; 
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Implement it in .js:&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;const cds = require('@sap/cds');

const SapCfMailer = require("sap-cf-mailer").default;



module.exports = cds.service.impl(function () {

    this.on('sendMail', async () =&amp;gt; {

        try {

            const transporter = new SapCfMailer("GmailSMTP"); // Match your destination

            const result = await transporter.sendMail({

In that case:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Build and deploy your &lt;STRONG&gt;MTA project&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Even if the deployment isn’t fully successful, the necessary services will still be created.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MaheshSirsat1708_4-1755079836096.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300313i789B7C3115BC6A71/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MaheshSirsat1708_4-1755079836096.png" alt="MaheshSirsat1708_4-1755079836096.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;2.Go to &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Foundry → Services&lt;/STRONG&gt; and bind your app to the newly created destinations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MaheshSirsat1708_5-1755079836100.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300312i95FC032DA5B05170/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="MaheshSirsat1708_5-1755079836100.png" alt="MaheshSirsat1708_5-1755079836100.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;3.After binding, your .env file will automatically include the credentials you need.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;If you’re working with an existing app, you can skip the MTA build ,just bind the Cloud Foundry services, and you’re ready to go.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Let’s test:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Run cds watch and call sendMail from your browser. Check your inbox, your screenshot will show the email arriving.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="MaheshSirsat1708_6-1755079836102.png" style="width: 892px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/300311iA7308BCD98CEDB53/image-dimensions/892x136?v=v2" width="892" height="136" role="button" title="MaheshSirsat1708_6-1755079836102.png" alt="MaheshSirsat1708_6-1755079836102.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 5: Sending HTML Emails&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can send nicely formatted emails with HTML. Just store your HTML in a variable and pass it to the html property:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;this.on('sendMail', async () =&amp;gt; {

        try {

            const transporter = new SapCfMailer("GmailSMTP"); //enter destination name



            const htmlContent = `&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;

                        &amp;lt;html&amp;gt;

                        &amp;lt;body style="margin:0;padding:0;background:#f6f7fb;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"&amp;gt;

                            &amp;lt;table role="presentation" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="background:#f6f7fb;"&amp;gt;

                            &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;

                                &amp;lt;td align="center" style="padding:24px;"&amp;gt;

                                &amp;lt;table role="presentation" width="600" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="background:#ffffff;border-radius:12px;padding:24px;"&amp;gt;

                                    &amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;

                                    &amp;lt;td&amp;gt;

                                        &amp;lt;h2 style="margin:0 0 12px;font-size:20px;color:#111;"&amp;gt;Hello Mahesh 👋&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

                                        This is a quick test email from your SAP BTP CAP app. If you can read this, your mail setup works!

The setup allows you to send plain text or richly formatted HTML emails, include multiple recipients, CCs, or attachments, and work securely using Gmail App Passwords, avoiding less secure app issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Everything we tested—sending a basic email, an HTML email, and attaching a PDF—worked smoothly, showing that this approach is ready for real-world use. Your CAP app can now reliably send notifications, reports, or alerts to users&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Traditionally, basic authentication with &lt;STRONG&gt;SUSER credentials&lt;/STRONG&gt; was required when connecting SAP Cloud Connector (SCC) with a BTP subaccount. While functional, this approach has critical drawbacks:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":warning:"&gt;⚠️&lt;/span&gt;Static credentials stored in config&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":warning:"&gt;⚠️&lt;/span&gt;Weak auditability&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":warning:"&gt;⚠️&lt;/span&gt;Complex user/password management&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the adoption of &lt;STRONG&gt;token-based authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO)&lt;/STRONG&gt; using a &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Identity Provider (IdP)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP now offers a smarter and more secure way of handling access. This blog explains how the shift strengthens security, simplifies user management, and eliminates the dependency on SUSER credentials.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1344904135"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":rocket:"&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;What’s New: Token-Based Authentication for the SCC ↔ Subaccount Link&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of sending an S-user + password when adding/maintaining the subaccount in SCC, you trigger an &lt;STRONG&gt;SSO flow&lt;/STRONG&gt;: the subaccount’s &lt;STRONG&gt;trust configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt; redirects to your &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom IdP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, issues a &lt;STRONG&gt;short-lived token&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;BTP validates&lt;/STRONG&gt; it to complete the SCC connection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why it matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":cross_mark:"&gt;❌&lt;/span&gt;No static S-user secrets in SCC&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Short-lived tokens + centralized IdP policies/MFA&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Clean audit trail and easy revocation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1148390630"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":gear:"&gt;⚙️&lt;/span&gt;Step-by-Step Configuration (Corrected)&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1 — Configure Custom IdP in the BTP Subaccount&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;BTP Cockpit → &lt;STRONG&gt;Subaccount → Security → Trust Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Add/enable your &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom IdP&lt;/STRONG&gt;

Map Roles (in Subaccount)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ensure the &lt;STRONG&gt;admin user exists in the subaccount&lt;/STRONG&gt; and is mapped to the Custom IdP&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Assign the &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Connector Administrator&lt;/STRONG&gt;

Which IdPs are supported?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP IAS, Azure AD, Okta, Ping&lt;/STRONG&gt;, etc., via SAML/OIDC per enterprise policy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q3. Extra cost?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;No new SAP license; enterprise IdP subscriptions/policies apply as usual.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q4. Is this mandatory for all subaccounts now?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;Not mandated, but it’s the &lt;STRONG&gt;recommended&lt;/STRONG&gt; security posture going forward.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q5. Must the admin user exist in the subaccount?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Yes. The user must be &lt;STRONG&gt;provisioned in the subaccount&lt;/STRONG&gt;, mapped to the &lt;STRONG&gt;Custom IdP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and assigned &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Connector Administrator&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Otherwise, the SSO/token step fails.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q6. How do old subaccounts switch from S-user to token-based SSO?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;Use the &lt;STRONG&gt;certificate renewal&lt;/STRONG&gt; process to re-establish the link with token-based SSO—no new subaccount needed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--30690400"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":direct_hit:"&gt;🎯&lt;/span&gt;Key Takeaway&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Modernize the &lt;STRONG&gt;SCC ↔ subaccount&lt;/STRONG&gt; connection with &lt;STRONG&gt;token-based SSO&lt;/STRONG&gt;. You’ll remove S-user secrets, enforce corporate IdP controls (MFA, policies), gain clean auditability, and cut down operational toil. For legacy links, plan the switch at the &lt;STRONG&gt;next certificate renewal&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-120050452"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":small_blue_diamond:"&gt;🔹&lt;/span&gt;Bonus Update – What’s New in Cloud Connector&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although this blog is about &lt;STRONG&gt;SSO in Cloud Connector&lt;/STRONG&gt;, here’s a quick surprise update:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP introduced a &lt;STRONG&gt;new option to upload authentication data&lt;/STRONG&gt; starting with &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Connector 2.17.0&lt;/STRONG&gt; (released in &lt;STRONG&gt;May 2024&lt;/STRONG&gt;).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of manually entering region, subaccount ID, and other details, you can now simply upload the authentication.data file.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;This file is generated using the &lt;STRONG&gt;credentials of the user you log in with to the BTP cockpit&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":warning:"&gt;⚠️&lt;/span&gt;That user must have the &lt;STRONG&gt;necessary authorizations to perform Cloud Connector administrator tasks&lt;/STRONG&gt; in order for the upload to succeed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;This makes subaccount onboarding and certificate renewal much easier and less error-prone.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;So if you’re running &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Connector 2.17.0 or newer&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you can take advantage of this simplified workflow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--369866060"&gt;Below are the steps with screenshots:&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Login to BTP cockpit, Select Cloud Connectors.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is Blue-Green Deployment?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Blue-Green Deployment in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Cloud Foundry&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a reliable strategy for updating applications with &lt;STRONG&gt;zero downtime&lt;/STRONG&gt; and minimal risk. The concept revolves around maintaining two identical environments:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Blue&lt;/STRONG&gt; – the current live environment actively serving users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Green&lt;/STRONG&gt; – the new version of the application, deployed in parallel for testing and validation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While end-users continue working in the &lt;STRONG&gt;Blue&lt;/STRONG&gt; environment, developers can safely deploy and verify the updated application in &lt;STRONG&gt;Green&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This allows for functional testing, performance checks, and integration validation without affecting live operations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the &lt;STRONG&gt;Green&lt;/STRONG&gt; environment is confirmed to be stable and fully functional, traffic is seamlessly redirected from &lt;STRONG&gt;Blue&lt;/STRONG&gt; to &lt;STRONG&gt;Green&lt;/STRONG&gt;, making it the new production environment. If any issues arise after the switch, rollback is straightforward—traffic can quickly be pointed back to &lt;STRONG&gt;Blue&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensuring business continuity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP BTP supports this deployment approach through the &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Foundry CLI&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Multi-Target Application (MTA) deployment tools&lt;/STRONG&gt;, making it particularly well-suited for rolling out updates to mission-critical business applications where even a few minutes of downtime is unacceptable. This method not only improves release reliability but also enhances user confidence in the stability of new updates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Key Advantages:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Zero Downtime Deployments&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Quick Rollback&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Improved Business Continuity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Restriction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Blue Green deployment is supported only for cloud foundry application.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1737803085"&gt;1. Introduction:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When it comes to securely connecting to SAP on-premise systems, &lt;STRONG&gt;API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; stand as two key pillars of the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt;. While API Management is often aligned with &lt;STRONG&gt;user-centric&lt;/STRONG&gt; flows — where the focus is on authenticating and authorizing the end user — Cloud Integration has traditionally dealt with &lt;STRONG&gt;system-to-system&lt;/STRONG&gt; communication, which involves backend calls without direct end-user context.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Having said that, across both these capabilities, the ability to connect to backend systems using a &lt;STRONG&gt;fixed technical credential&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a widely desired&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color="#008000"&gt;*&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; approach. However, in many SAP Cloud Integration (CPI) scenarios, the term &lt;STRONG&gt;technical user&lt;/STRONG&gt; is often equated with “Basic Authentication” — a method increasingly viewed by organizations as less secure. A stronger and more trusted approach for connecting applications and services running in SAP BTP to SAP on-premise systems is &lt;STRONG&gt;principal propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where the SAP Cloud Connector generates a short-lived X.509 certificate containing a &lt;STRONG&gt;Common Name (CN)&lt;/STRONG&gt; dynamically retrieved from the calling system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="100%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":light_bulb:"&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color="#008000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;*&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;EM&gt;CPI customers on the BTP &lt;STRONG&gt;Neo&lt;/STRONG&gt; environment are familiar with a feature called &lt;STRONG&gt;certificate-to-user mapping&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which allows an incoming client certificate to be directly mapped to a backend user identity. This made technical user propagation both straightforward and widely adopted.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;In &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the incoming certificate is typically mapped to an access token associated with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;service key credential&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;rather than being directly mapped to a backend user's security context, as in Neo. As a result, customers often struggle to replicate their established Neo patterns, especially for &lt;STRONG&gt;fixed technical identities&lt;/STRONG&gt; — this is the exact problem that has now been solved!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;As a side note, if you’d like to dive deeper into certificate-to-user mapping and certificate-based authentication in SAP Cloud Integration, you can refer to Mandy Krimmel’s insightful blog posts covering both &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/integration-blog-posts/cloud-integration-how-to-setup-secure-http-inbound-connection-with-client/bc-p/13336246" target="_self"&gt;Neo&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/integration-blog-posts/cloud-integration-on-cf-how-to-setup-secure-http-inbound-connection-with/ba-p/13393777" target="_self"&gt;Cloud Foundry&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here's where things start to get interesting. With &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Connector version 2.15&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP introduced the ability to perform &lt;STRONG&gt;technical user propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt; using the &lt;U&gt;SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication&lt;/U&gt; HTTP header. This allows a cloud application to send a signed JWT representing the fixed technical identity, which the Cloud Connector uses to generate a short-lived X.509 certificate — all without relying on static passwords. You can read more about this feature in the official SAP Help Portal &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/connectivity/sap-btp-connectivity-cf/authentication-to-on-premise-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;documentation&lt;/A&gt; and the SAP Community &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/technical-user-propagation-sap-btp-to-s4-on-premise/bc-p/13555634" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditionally, principal propagation has been used to propagate an &lt;STRONG&gt;end-user identity&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but here’s the beauty: it can just as easily propagate a &lt;STRONG&gt;fixed (technical) identity&lt;/STRONG&gt; as a short-lived X.509 certificate. This means you can retain all the advantages of principal propagation — dynamic credentials, reduced exposure, and assured identity mapping — without falling back to basic authentication.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="a35bsx.jpg" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301589i40213A0D9133A351/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="a35bsx.jpg" alt="a35bsx.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This blog post, co-authored by &lt;U&gt;Vinayak Adkoli&lt;/U&gt; and &lt;U&gt;Sunny Kapoor,&lt;/U&gt; focuses on &lt;STRONG&gt;technical user propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt; within &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;, exploring how such credentials can be securely propagated across three common Receiver Adapters — &lt;STRONG&gt;SOAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;HTTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;OData V2&lt;/STRONG&gt;. In a follow-up post, we will examine similar patterns from the perspective of &lt;STRONG&gt;API Management’s OnPremise connectivity&lt;/STRONG&gt; flows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1541289580"&gt;2. Cloud Connector and backend prerequisites to support Technical user propagation&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before you can configure an IFlow in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt; to propagate a fixed technical user via a short-lived X.509 certificate, both the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Connector&lt;/STRONG&gt; and the &lt;STRONG&gt;backend system&lt;/STRONG&gt; must be prepared to handle this scenario.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This section outlines the key steps and underlying rationale, but it is not a complete how-to guide.

Txn &lt;U&gt;STRUST&lt;/U&gt; leads us to the Trust Manager. I have the CA certificate and the Root Certificate that signed this CA certificate in the Trust Store&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 4.42.54 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301594iBBEA818C78CE1787/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 4.42.54 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 4.42.54 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;5.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Note that there are 3 key configuration parameters defined in Txn &lt;U&gt;RZ10&lt;/U&gt;.

Transaction &lt;U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;CERTRULE&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/U&gt; opens the rule-based certificate mapping screen. If you've previously set up principal propagation, you likely already have a rule using the '&lt;STRONG&gt;CN=*&lt;/STRONG&gt;' filter, where the wildcard typically resolves to an email address or user name. This approach works well for user-based principal propagation. However, since our objective here is to propagate a technical user, we'll instead make use of the Explicit Mapping tab.&amp;nbsp;We’ll go into more detail on this in section 5.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":light_bulb:"&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt;You will notice that I’ve taken a slightly different approach here compared to Munish Suri’s helpful &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/technical-user-propagation-sap-btp-to-s4-on-premise/ba-p/13555630" target="_self"&gt;blog&lt;/A&gt;, where he creates a &lt;STRONG&gt;service user&lt;/STRONG&gt; in transaction SU01. The reason that step won’t work in our case is that the ‘alias’ field is limited to 40 characters, while the client ID from BTP XSUAA exceeds that limit.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 4.37.06 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301597iB5507D995059914E/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 4.37.06 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 4.37.06 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 11.21.03 AM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/302649i758FD4E639DB6E74/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 11.21.03 AM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 11.21.03 AM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-755235560"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-558722055"&gt;3.

Setting up a simple IFlow for Technical user propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To illustrate how &lt;STRONG&gt;technical user propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt; works in practice, we’ll walk through the setup of three simple integration flows (iFlows) in SAP Cloud Integration — each using a different &lt;STRONG&gt;Receiver Adapter&lt;/STRONG&gt;: &lt;STRONG&gt;SOAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;HTTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;OData V2&lt;/STRONG&gt;. These examples are deliberately kept minimal so you can focus on the &lt;STRONG&gt;adapter configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;principal propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt; setup, without getting lost in unrelated processing logic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-container"&gt;&lt;a class="lia-spoiler-link" href="#" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;noscript&gt; (Highlight to read)&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-border"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-content"&gt;Technical user propagation for HTTP and OData V2 Adapters works out of the box.&amp;nbsp; A small adjustment is needed only for the SOAP Adapter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-container"&gt;&lt;div class="lia-spoiler-noscript-content"&gt;Technical user propagation for HTTP and OData V2 Adapters works out of the box.&amp;nbsp; A small adjustment is needed only for the SOAP Adapter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;P&gt;As mentioned before, each scenario we present can be executed in either of the two ways as listed below to inject the fixed technical identity :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;With a client certificate presented by the sending system (i.e. mTLS)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Following 'client credential' grant type, i.e., client_id and client_secret&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--663397127"&gt;4.1.&amp;nbsp;OData V2 Receiver Adapter – Technical user propagation setup&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s start with a common integration scenario: consuming an &lt;STRONG&gt;OData V2&lt;/STRONG&gt; service from an on-premise SAP backend system. In this setup, technical user propagation enables Cloud Integration to connect to the backend using a short-lived X.509 certificate that represents a fixed technical identity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the 2506 &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/whats-new/5793247a5d5741beb0decc5b7dee1160" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;update&lt;/A&gt;, SAP Integration Suite now supports technical user propagation &lt;STRONG&gt;out of the box&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Just choose ‘&lt;U&gt;principal propagation&lt;/U&gt;’ in the Authentication drop-down, and the system will automatically pass along either the end-user or technical-user context to the cloud connector and eventually to the backend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2506 product increment" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/302707i02303C76CD243C4D/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 1.40.43 PM.png" alt="2506 product increment" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;2506 product increment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Below is an illustration of a simple IFlow that leverages the OData V2 receiver adapter&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="a simplified example of an OData V2 Receiver Adapter" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/302709iC1CB1E0F674A96FE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 12.59.39 PM.png" alt="a simplified example of an OData V2 Receiver Adapter" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;a simplified example of an OData V2 Receiver Adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's review the 'Connection' settings on the Adapter's property sheet.

Here is a snippet of the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration/sap-cloud-integration/http-receiver-adapter" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;documentation&lt;/A&gt; page that describes the support for technical user propagation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-23 at 8.52.56 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304326i36E7124144E4D302/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-23 at 8.52.56 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-23 at 8.52.56 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's extend our sample IFlow with a sequence of steps that leverages this functionality.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 1.01.18 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304327iF9ADF05694461FFB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 1.01.18 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 1.01.18 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I've marked the HTTP Receiver Adapter attached to a new 'Request-Reply' step. The adapter’s property sheet closely resembles that of the OData V2 Adapter, with the authentication type configured as &lt;EM&gt;Principal Propagation.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-23 at 6.12.57 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304328i42F3E99C81A4FDF7/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-23 at 6.12.57 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-23 at 6.12.57 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s trigger the IFlow using a curl command. Unlike the OData V2 Adapter example, where we used a certificate, this time we’ll authenticate with the client_credentials grant type by providing a Bearer token.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciO&amp;lt;truncated&amp;gt;' https://&amp;lt;cpi-instance&amp;gt;.cfapps.&amp;lt;landscape&amp;gt;.hana.ondemand.com/http/&amp;lt;pathsuffix&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;You should see a successful execution, and the Cloud Connector and backend logs should align with the explanation in the OData V2 Adapter scenario.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1056424137"&gt;4.3. SOAP Receiver Adapter – Technical user propagation setup&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Next, let’s set up the same scenario for the SOAP Receiver Adapter. Unlike the HTTP and OData V2 adapters, which worked almost seamlessly by simply enabling ‘&lt;EM&gt;principal propagation&lt;/EM&gt;,’ the SOAP approach requires a bit more configuration effort.&amp;nbsp; (Note that this may change in one of our future releases.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is my updated sample IFlow with a local integration process step added to handle the SOAP Adapter as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 1.09.28 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304411i88201994F95EE1CC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 1.09.28 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-19 at 1.09.28 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The first step in my Local Integration Process is a Content Modifier that creates the 'SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication' header and assigns it the value of the incoming 'Authorization' header.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 12.52.31 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304419i9CA9586B4C92F2C2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 12.52.31 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 12.52.31 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is a simple illustration of my SOAP Adapter that invokes a SOAP Service from my S/4HANA system. Carefully note that I have set the 'Authentication' to &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;none&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; (instead of &lt;EM&gt;principal propagation&lt;/EM&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 12.53.06 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304420iD9AF3171E61BF7A3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 12.53.06 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 12.53.06 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also, do not forget to include the 'Authorization' as an allowed header within the Runtime Configuration section block, as we are reading this attribute. You may need to tailor the Namespace Mapping based on your backend's WSDL settings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 12.53.25 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304421iB1C1502108C1FB69/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 12.53.25 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-24 at 12.53.25 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's go ahead and issue a POST call to our Integration Flow to invoke the&amp;nbsp;'CreditManagementAccountByIDQuery' Operation from the SOAP Service.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is the (request.xml) XML payload I've used:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;glob:CreditManagementAccountByIDQuery xmlns:glob="http://sap.com/xi/SAPGlobal/Global"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;Selection&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;DebtorPartyInternalID&amp;gt;MDG_CU01&amp;lt;/DebtorPartyInternalID&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;CreditsegmentInternalID&amp;gt;0002&amp;lt;/CreditsegmentInternalID&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/Selection&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;LanguageCode&amp;gt;en&amp;lt;/LanguageCode&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/glob:CreditManagementAccountByIDQuery&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are my CURL commands:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImprd...full_token_here...JJQog" &amp;gt; token.txt

curl 'https://&amp;lt;cpi-instance&amp;gt;.cfapps.&amp;lt;landscape&amp;gt;.hana.ondemand.com/http/&amp;lt;pathsuffix&amp;gt;' \
  --header 'target: soap' \
  --header 'Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --data .xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This concludes our testing of invoking the SOAP Adapter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":light_bulb:"&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Note on Transparency in Technical User Propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the three scenarios we laid out above (OData V2, SOAP, and HTTP), the &lt;STRONG&gt;client or sender system&lt;/STRONG&gt; was responsible for presenting the &lt;EM&gt;technical client ID&lt;/EM&gt; that ultimately got propagated downstream. While this approach works well, there are situations where it may be desirable to keep this entire process &lt;STRONG&gt;transparent to the end user&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In such cases, the integration developer can insert a &lt;STRONG&gt;Request Reply step&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the iFlow to first call the &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth token endpoint&lt;/STRONG&gt; using a different set of credentials — not necessarily exposed or known to the consuming client. The resulting access token can then be injected into the SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication header, ensuring that the technical user propagation still takes place, but without burdening the client with the responsibility of handling technical credentials directly. Here is a sample Groovy script snippet that can be placed after retrieving the access token&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import com.sap.gateway.ip.core.customdev.util.Message;
import groovy.json.JsonSlurper;

def Message processData(Message message) {
    // Get the response body as a string
    def body = message.getBody(String);
    
    // Parse the JSON response
    def jsonSlurper = new JsonSlurper();
    def jsonResponse = jsonSlurper.parseText(body);
    
    // Extract the access token (assuming the token is in a field called "access_token")
    def accessToken = jsonResponse.access_token;
    def bearerToken = "Bearer "+ accessToken;
    
    // Set the access token as a message header for technical authentication
    message.setHeader("SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication", bearerToken);

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This pattern is particularly useful when you want to &lt;STRONG&gt;decouple client-facing authentication&lt;/STRONG&gt; from &lt;STRONG&gt;backend technical connectivity&lt;/STRONG&gt;, giving you more flexibility and control over how identities are managed across the landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--666131628"&gt;5. Mapping technical users to ABAP users in the backend&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now we will connect the dots between the &lt;U&gt;technical user&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;and an ABAP &lt;U&gt;backend user&lt;/U&gt;. This ensures that when Cloud Integration presents the technical identity, the backend system knows exactly which user account to log on with.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We’ll achieve this by generating a &lt;STRONG&gt;sample X.509 certificate&lt;/STRONG&gt; that represents the technical client identifier, and then explicitly mapping it to an ABAP user via transaction &lt;STRONG&gt;CERTRULE&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is a step-by-step instruction to perform this mapping.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="10.239885427855354%"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1449451147"&gt;Step No.&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="49.12280701754387%"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1645964652"&gt;Description&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="40.63730755460078%"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1842478157"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="10.239885427855354%"&gt;1.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="49.12280701754387%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Get back to the SAP Cloud Connector -&amp;gt; Configuration -&amp;gt; On Premise setting page and click on the button at the bottom of the screen labelled '&lt;U&gt;Generate a Sample Certificate&lt;/U&gt;'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We need this dummy short-lived X.509 certificate to perform the mapping step.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Notice that I'm demonstrating setting the ${user_type} to 'Technical' as indicated in point 2.2&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="40.63730755460078%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-23 at 5.08.51 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304319iC931BD17A01531E7/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-23 at 5.08.51 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-23 at 5.08.51 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="10.239885427855354%"&gt;2.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="49.12280701754387%"&gt;Paste the client_id retrieved from step 3.2 / 3.4 in the CN field and click '&lt;U&gt;Generate&lt;/U&gt;'.

In the Cloud Connector configuration, there is an option called &lt;EM&gt;“System Certificate for Logon”&lt;/EM&gt;. When this option is enabled, the Cloud Connector will use its own system certificate to authenticate in cases where &lt;STRONG&gt;no principal information&lt;/STRONG&gt; is available in the request.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While this might sound convenient, it introduces an important caveat: a &lt;STRONG&gt;fixed technical user&lt;/STRONG&gt; will always be propagated — even in scenarios where your design expected to rely on true end-user principal propagation. Instead of failing due to missing identity information, the Cloud Connector silently falls back to the system certificate and logs on with the mapped technical user. Another common case that results in “no principal information” is when the &lt;STRONG&gt;authentication&lt;/STRONG&gt; section of the Cloud Integration adapter is set to &lt;EM&gt;None&lt;/EM&gt; — either deliberately for testing, or accidentally left that way during configuration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This can be problematic in security-sensitive landscapes, because it may unintentionally bypass your intended identity propagation setup. It’s therefore crucial to carefully review whether this setting should be &lt;STRONG&gt;enabled&lt;/STRONG&gt; in your environment and confirm that it aligns with your authentication and compliance requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1648699153"&gt;7. Final thoughts&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As we’ve seen across the &lt;STRONG&gt;OData V2&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;SOAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;HTTP&lt;/STRONG&gt; receiver adapters, SAP Integration Suite offers a flexible yet secure way to propagate a &lt;EM&gt;technical user&lt;/EM&gt; without falling back on basic authentication. By leveraging the &lt;STRONG&gt;short-lived X.509 certificates&lt;/STRONG&gt; issued through Cloud Connector and carefully configuring the adapter authentication settings, customers can ensure consistent, policy-compliant access to their on-premise systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This approach not only modernizes the classic “certificate-to-user mapping” patterns familiar from the Neo environment but also aligns with Cloud Foundry’s service key–based model, giving you the best of both worlds: the security of principal propagation and the practicality of fixed user connectivity where required. With these patterns in hand, you can design integrations that are both &lt;STRONG&gt;secure&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;operationally simple&lt;/STRONG&gt;, while avoiding common pitfalls such as unintended fallbacks or misconfigured authentication.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":pushpin:"&gt;📌&lt;/span&gt;In the next installment of this series, we’ll extend the same concept to &lt;STRONG&gt;API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;, focusing on how technical user propagation works through the On-Premise Proxy component — so stay tuned if you’re interested in applying these patterns beyond Cloud Integration.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;EDITED : API Management blog article is linked &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/applying-techncial-user-propagation-to-api-management/ba-p/14191788" target="_self"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Yes! Trial accounts now support Platform SSO via IAS or any configured Identity Provider. You no longer need an S-User for cockpit or CLI access.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q2: Do I need to create a user in both IAS and BTP?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Yes. Create the user in IAS first, then create the corresponding user in BTP linked to the IAS IdP and assign the necessary roles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q3: Can I use Azure AD or another IdP instead of IAS?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Yes, any trusted Identity Provider configured at the global account level can be used for Platform SSO.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q4: Does Platform SSO work for both cockpit and CLI?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Absolutely. You can log in to BTP cockpit via the SSO URL and to BTP CLI using the --idp and origin key.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q5: Why is an origin key needed for CLI login?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The origin key tells the CLI which Identity Provider to use for authentication, especially when multiple IdPs are configured.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q6: Is Platform SSO secure?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Yes. By using IAS or any trusted IdP, authentication is centralized, supports MFA, and follows enterprise-grade security policies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1254772490"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":direct_hit:"&gt;🎯&lt;/span&gt;Conclusion&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With &lt;STRONG&gt;Platform SSO now enabled for trial accounts&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP has made it much easier for new customers, partners, and developers to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Run &lt;STRONG&gt;POCs&lt;/STRONG&gt; faster &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":rocket:"&gt;🚀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Onboard trial users without S-User IDs &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":key:"&gt;🔑&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Experience enterprise-grade &lt;STRONG&gt;SSO with IAS&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":locked:"&gt;🔒&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This change is a &lt;STRONG&gt;big step forward&lt;/STRONG&gt; for &lt;STRONG&gt;customer adoption and onboarding&lt;/STRONG&gt; in SAP BTP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1744689002"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":folded_hands:"&gt;🙏&lt;/span&gt; Thank You&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;A special thanks to &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&lt;/STRONG&gt; for enabling &lt;STRONG&gt;Platform SSO in Trial accounts&lt;/STRONG&gt;, making it easier for &lt;STRONG&gt;new customers, partners, and developers&lt;/STRONG&gt; to explore SAP BTP securely and efficiently.&lt;BR /&gt;This update truly accelerates &lt;STRONG&gt;POCs, onboarding, and hands-on learning&lt;/STRONG&gt; for everyone.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Hello World! Tudo bem?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Após o encerramento com sucesso do primeiro SAP Inside Track Londrina (2025), que foi um evento somente presencial e contou com muitas apresentações de qualidade, resolvi criar esse material aqui na comunidade para aqueles que não puderam comparecer pessoalmente.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Evento 2025.jpeg" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305144i1F014271F2B730B8/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Evento 2025.jpeg" alt="Evento 2025.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Então segue a apresentação do conteúdo do SIT Londrina 2025, em formato "Live":&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FNcAlhFdOR5A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNcAlhFdOR5A&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FNcAlhFdOR5A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="400" height="225" scrolling="no" title="Segurança em Aplicações/Serviços no BTP em épocas de IA - SIT Londrina 2025" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Mas se ainda não se contextualizou, sugiro antes de assistir o material acima ler todo o conteúdo abaixo e entender a evolução até o evento SIT Londrina 2025, ok?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Se você não conhece SAP e chegou até aqui, segue um pequeno resumo:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;SAP é um software de gestão empresarial usado pelas maiores e mais importantes empresas do mundo para integrar e otimizar processos de negócios cruciais, como finanças e logística. Ele centraliza dados para fornecer uma visão completa e em tempo real, permitindo decisões estratégicas mais rápidas e eficientes. A sua importância reside em ser uma espinha dorsal tecnológica que garante a eficiência e a competitividade global dessas corporações.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No evento, realizei a apresentação “Segurança em Aplicações/Serviços no BTP em épocas de IA” sobre Cyber Security no mundo SAP, para aplicações desenvolvidas em um modelo bem específico. Mas com esse post aqui, o objetivo é atingir e disponibilizar o conteúdo a todos da comunidade SAP, bem como os curiosos e interessados pelo tema de segurança da informação. Como muitos podem estar lendo pela primeira vez sobre o tema e o que eu já fiz até então, vou detalhar a historia desde o começo de uma maneira resumida até chegar no SIT Londrina 2025, ok?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Tudo começou na Pandemia, no ano de 2020/2021, onde estava fazendo uma pesquisa para um blog que iria escrever sobre um tutorial de um tipo desenvolvimento Web especifico (SAPUI5) . Esse tutorial seria sobre o desenvolvimento de aplicações UI5/FIORI ao publico B2C, ou seja usuários que em sua maioria nunca teriam visto nada sobre SAP e que para eles seria como uma aplicação Web qualquer, também aplicações essas que seriam disponibilizadas na internet para acesso do publico em geral. No Blog eu iria abordar a arquitetura recomendada, exemplos de códigos fonte, etc., porém na etapa de pesquisa para apresentar alguns “exemplos” já existentes no mercado, me deparei com cenários muito assustadores!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Para contextualizar, “o sistema SAP” sempre é em sua maioria um sistema “fechado”, onde o acesso é feito geralmente por quem de fato precisa do mesmo (até por questão de custo de licença). Analisando a minha experiencia, de colegas e muitos estudos, conseguia afirmar então que os profissionais que desenvolvem, desenham e/ou especificam soluções SAP ao “publico geral”, em sua maioria não tem uma preocupação com os quesitos de segurança. No mundo SAP, os desenvolvimentos geralmente ficam dentro do sistema e/ou na rede interna do cliente, então esse tópico nunca foi muito explorado pelos profissionais e consultorias que desenvolvem soluções customizadas, e esse aqui foi o principal motivador de iniciar todo o conteúdo. Ou seja, profissionais do mundo SAP precisam se atentar e se preparar ao criar soluções desse tipo, pois os impactos de não fazer algo correto podem ser enormes (que verá logo mais alguns exemplos). Pois se algum desses casos caísse nas mãos erradas, não só a imagem da empresa em questão que usa SAP, independente do país que está localizada, seria impactada com prejuízos financeiros e até implicações legais, mas nós profissionais do mundo SAP também seriamos impactados pela “imagem” que seria passada que o sistema SAP é de alguma maneira "inseguro".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Antes de entrarmos no detalhe tenho que falar algo importante, tudo que falarei daqui em diante diz respeito a &lt;STRONG&gt;aplicações/serviços customizados&lt;/STRONG&gt; e &lt;U&gt;não standard SAP&lt;/U&gt;, ou seja foram soluções desenvolvidas por alguém para atender o requisito daquele cliente em específico, e não algo que “vem” no produto SAP. Soluções SAP a nível de produto no geral são muitos seguras, onde a mesma investe muito para manter o mais alto nível de segurança, utilizando todas as ferramentas e métodos de mercado para tal. Até ter programas onde pode “contratar” profissionais de cyber segurança para tentar explorar e descobrir como deixar seus produtos mais seguros (onde eu posso ou não ter participado. NDA). Recomendo os links &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/security.html%20" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;1&lt;/A&gt; e &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/what-is-cybersecurity.html%20" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;2&lt;/A&gt; para quem deseja se aprofundar mais no tema de segurança no nível de produto SAP. Outro ponto importante, é que demonstro como essas aplicações customizadas podem ser facilmente encontradas na internet por ferramentas como Google Buscador.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Na pesquisa fui encontrando muitas empresas vulneráveis em um numero altíssimo, quase podendo afirmar que mais 30% das que encontrei, tinham algum problema. Então o que era um tutorial mudou para uma pesquisa mais aprofundada do tema, e com isso resolvi criar o movimento &lt;A href="https://safesapui5.web.app/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;#SafeSAPUI5&lt;/A&gt;. Que basicamente iniciaria com a criação de material e conscientização dos profissionais para termos aplicações e serviços SAP seguros que estão expostos na internet. Pois aqui entra um detalhe técnico bem agravante, para muitos casos o requerimento do cliente (ou seja, o que ele precisa) é ter uma aplicação customizada porem sem ter a necessidade de &lt;STRONG&gt;nenhum tipo de autenticação&lt;/STRONG&gt; por parte do usuário que vai acessar. Ou seja, ao clicar na URL ele já deve entrar na aplicação customizada e poder fazer a ação necessária, cenário esse que foge bem do “padrão” SAP e existem muitas e &lt;U&gt;muitas aplicações como essa espalhadas pelo mundo&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Os materiais do #SafeSAPUI5 podem ser encontrados &lt;A href="https://safesapui5.web.app/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;aqui&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Além dos mesmos, como já estava pronto para escrever, resolvi criar um Ebook gratuito sobre o tema, juntando um pouco de historia, exemplos, dicas e casos reais. Com isso, nasceu o ebook UI5 Hacker, que pode ser encontrado gratuitamente &lt;A href="https://ui5hacker.web.app/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;aqui&lt;/A&gt; (Português e Inglês).&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Juntando tudo isso apresentei a primeira palestra do tema, ainda na Pandemia, no evento UI5 Con 2021 (em Inglês) que é a conferencia global de SAPUI5, biblioteca utilizada para realizar esses desenvolvimentos (mais detalhes na palestra ou ebook).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;UI5CON 2021: #SafeSAPUI5:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FIyLPftaF8CA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIyLPftaF8CA&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FIyLPftaF8CA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="400" height="225" scrolling="no" title="#SafeSAPUI5" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Depois da mesma, com a ajuda da própria SAP, consegui espalhar essa conscientização e também comunicar os clientes ao redor do mundo que estavam inseguros e foram citados nos exemplos da palestra e ebook (alguns com vulnerabilidades muito graves, como cópia do passaporte de todos os usuários pronta para ser extraída por exemplo). Importante, era possível conseguir isso sem precisar realizar nenhum tipo de hack, apenas saber executar um serviço/API que está exposto na internet (até pelo próprio navegador).&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Então em 2023, resolvi fazer um compilado do material de 2021 em Português (com alguns novos exemplos) e apresentar no SIT SP 2023 (Serviços Seguros &amp;amp; Aplicações Seguras), trazendo a tona novamente o material e o tema (agora focado mais em Português).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A palestra pode ser vista no Youtube aqui:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FrBvyOuJZDHA%3Fstart%3D2219%26feature%3Doembed%26start%3D2219&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrBvyOuJZDHA&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FrBvyOuJZDHA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="400" height="225" scrolling="no" title="Serviços Seguros &amp;amp; Aplicações Seguras (BTP, FIORI, S/4 e Segurança da Informação)" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Com isso tive muitos feedbacks positivos de profissionais e de clientes SAP que resolveram suas vulnerabilidades e passaram a adotar as praticas em seu dia a dia, para esse e outros requisitos. Mas é importante falar, &lt;STRONG&gt;é possível SIM&lt;/STRONG&gt; fazer uma aplicação WEB como essa que descrevi acima de maneira segura e protegida para o seu cliente, só seguir as boas praticas e utilizar as ferramentas corretas. Acontece que nesse "meio tempo", a adoção do &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP BTP&lt;/A&gt; (oferta da SAP de serviços Cloud, assim como os outros grandes players de tecnologia) cresceu exponencialmente no mundo todo. Se iniciou então um movimento de muitos clientes para levarem suas soluções para o BTP (conhecido como o movimento “move to cloud”), e alguns deles com aplicações se enquadrando nas possíveis vulnerabilidades descritas.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mas e então, apenas levar as aplicações ao BTP as deixam seguras?&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;E com a chegada, popularização e massiva utilização/evolução das &lt;A href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelig%C3%AAncia_artificial" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Inteligências Artificiais (IAs)&lt;/A&gt; impactam nisso tudo?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Para responder as questões acima e trazer a tona novamente o tema, resolvi criar o material da palestra apresentada no SIT Londrina 2025: “Segurança em Aplicações/Serviços no BTP em épocas de IA”. Mas como comentei antes, o evento foi somente presencial e por conta disso resolvi realizar uma “live” com o mesmo material e conteúdo para disponibilizar a todos o mesmo. Colocando em uma linha do tempo então, ficaria assim:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="MKT.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305145i1798EC4FADAC8DCB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MKT.png" alt="MKT.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;O PDF do material apresentado no SIT Londrina 2025 pode ser encontrado &lt;A href="http://tiny.cc/SITLON2025" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;aqui&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Após a apresentação desse material (PDF e "Live"), demonstro que uma simples ida ao SAP BTP com aplicações nesse modelo não te deixará mais seguro. E com a chegada das IAs, existe hoje uma rápida revolução no segmento de Cyber Security (assim como o mundo em geral) que as empresas que utilizam soluções SAP devem estar atentas e preparadas.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Espero que tenha gostado do conteúdo e lhe ajudado, e que de alguma maneira tenha agregando algo ao seu conhecimento atual.&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Obrigado e nos vemos nas próximas aventuras do “Hacker do Bem”.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Setting up user provisioning from a corporate LDAP into SAP Cloud Identity Service (CIS) — Identity Provisioning (IPS) is not the most common task — most customers today rely on Microsoft Entra ID (in sync with AD FS, for example).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But sometimes LDAP is still needed. I decided to reproduce this scenario and, at the same time, get my first hands-on with Docker: run OpenLDAP, connect User Interface, wire it through SAP Cloud Connector, and test provisioning into CIS → Identity Directory (IdDS).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Goal&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Spin up OpenLDAP in Docker with a GUI (phpLDAPadmin).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Configure Docker networking and port mapping.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Connect LDAP to SAP Cloud Connector (SCC).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Set up Identity Provisioning (IPS) to write into CIS.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="LDAP2.drawio.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306063i011FE59E8DB5CF2A/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="LDAP2.drawio.png" alt="LDAP2.drawio.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The beauty of containers is their lightweight nature and the ability to spin up everything with a single script.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For this setup I used:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/openldap" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;bitnami/openldap&lt;/A&gt; → the LDAP server holding user entries.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://github.com/osixia/docker-phpLDAPadmin" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;osixia/phpldapadmin&lt;/A&gt; → the GUI for user administration, so I don’t have to manage everything via CLI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;By exposing ports from the internal Docker network (via docker-compose), you can:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;access phpLDAPadmin locally in the browser to create test users,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;connect a local SAP Cloud Connector instance to the same LDAP through the mapped port, and then expose it into your BTP Subaccount.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Next step: solving a few practical issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1. Running OpenLDAP in a container&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Problem: OpenLDAP by default only listens inside the container (389) and is not accessible from the host.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Solution: map a host port, e.g. 13890:389.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2. Docker Networking (docker-compose)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Problem: containers may not see each other by hostname if not attached to the same user-defined network. Basic networking tools (nc, telnet) are also missing inside the images.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Solution: create a custom &lt;A href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/networks/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Docker network&lt;/A&gt; in &lt;A href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-docker-compose/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;docker-compose&lt;/A&gt; and connect both openldap and phpldapadmin to it. Inside the network use port 389; for external access, use the mapped port.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 3. phpLDAPadmin Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Problem: phpLDAPadmin expects to connect to localhost:389 by default.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Solution: configure environment variables in docker-compose.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Intermediate Result&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;OpenLDAP and phpLDAPadmin are up and running in Docker.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Internal networking and port mapping are configured.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You can now add test users via GUI and prepare LDAP for SCC → IPS integration.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Connecting SAP Cloud Connector (SCC)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SCC, create a new connection for your BTP Subaccount using LDAP protocol, pointing to localhost:13890.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;Back-end Type&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;Protocol&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;Internal Host&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;Virtual Host&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Principal Type&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;Non-ABAP System&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;LDAP&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;localhost:13890&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;ldap:389&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="20%" height="30px"&gt;None&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;Important: your Subaccount must have the &lt;EM&gt;Connectivity service plan&lt;/EM&gt; enabled in SAP Cloud Identity Services. This allows IPS &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/connect-to-on-premise-systems-in-sap-cloud-identity-infrastructure" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;to reach on-prem systems via SCC&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After successful setup, BTP Cockpit shows something like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Exposed Back-End Systems (SCC Location ID)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="25%"&gt;ldap:389&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="25%"&gt;LDAP&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="25%"&gt;Non-SAP System&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="25%"&gt;Available&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Configuring Identity Provisioning (IPS)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In IPS, create an LDAP source according to the usual &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity-services/cloud-identity-services/ldap-server" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Help documentation&lt;/A&gt;. You can use default Transformations here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Key detail&lt;/EM&gt;: the LDAP user object &lt;STRONG&gt;must contain the mail attribute&lt;/STRONG&gt;. If not present, IPS will skip the entry. Even the two default users shipped with the OpenLDAP container are enough to test the provisioning chain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;End-to-end check:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;LDAP → SCC → BTP → IPS → Identity Directory&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using containers makes it extremely fast to spin up a fully working LDAP provisioning scenario for SAP BTP. This approach is safe and easily reproducible also for testing transformations and mapping without touching a production corporate directory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;P.S.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Below you can find my &lt;EM&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/EM&gt; file &lt;STRONG&gt;as a reference for your own setup&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;services:

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1738703761"&gt;1. Introduction:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the previous &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/unravelling-the-technical-user-propagation-scenarios-in-sap-integration/ba-p/14182016" target="_self"&gt;blog&lt;/A&gt;, we explored how technical user propagation works in &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Integration Suite / Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; using the OData V2, SOAP, and HTTP receiver adapters. In this installment, we turn our attention to &lt;STRONG&gt;API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-api-management/sap-api-management/on-premise-connectivity-plan" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;on-premise proxy component&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;plays a crucial role in securely bridging cloud-hosted APIs with on-premise systems. Much like Cloud Integration, the question of propagating a &lt;EM&gt;fixed technical identity&lt;/EM&gt; comes up frequently here — but the mechanisms and configuration steps differ.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1542190256"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Quick recap on on-premise connectivity in API Management:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before diving deeper, let’s briefly review how &lt;STRONG&gt;API Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; handles connectivity to on-premise systems. Within the &lt;STRONG&gt;API Provider settings&lt;/STRONG&gt;, API Management supports the concept of &lt;EM&gt;Principal Propagation&lt;/EM&gt;. This means that when a request is forwarded to an on-premise system, the expectation is that a valid user session (or &lt;STRONG&gt;principal&lt;/STRONG&gt;) already exists — typically established via mechanisms such as SSO / token exchange.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Under the hood, the &lt;STRONG&gt;On-premise proxy component&lt;/STRONG&gt; in API Management uses the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;BTP Destination&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;as the connectivity anchor. The authenticated user session is propagated to this destination, which in turn leverages the &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Connector&lt;/STRONG&gt; to securely tunnel the call into the corporate network. Finally, at the backend system level, the &lt;STRONG&gt;X.509 certificate &lt;/STRONG&gt;mechanism comes into play, mapping the propagated principal to the appropriate backend user. We described this process in our previous blog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1345676751"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Concrete example – Entra ID &amp;amp; token exchange:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In practice, many customers authenticate users against Identity Provider systems such as Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). In this flow, Entra ID issues a JWT token where the &lt;U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;user subject&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/U&gt; (often the user’s email ID) is included as a claim. This JWT is then presented to API Management, which, after an optional verification step, in turn exchanges it with XSUAA using the OAuth2 SAML Assertion flow. The result is an XSUAA-issued token that the on-premise proxy component in API Management can securely propagate downstream. This pattern is widely adopted and serves as the backbone of many user-centric API Management scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt; There are many excellent SAP Community blogs that go into great detail about this token handshake and its variants. To keep our focus sharp, we won’t recap those here — instead, we’ll stay aligned with the specific objective of this blog: exploring how technical user propagation scenarios can be addressed in &lt;STRONG&gt;API Management’s On-Premise proxy component&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1149163246"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. From user sessions to technical credentials:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the model described above works seamlessly for user-centric flows, many integration patterns require a fixed technical credential instead. This is where customers start looking for approaches similar to the one we highlighted in Cloud Integration, where technical user propagation can be achieved by leveraging the '&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication&lt;/STRONG&gt;' header. With API Management’s on-premise proxy component, patterns are available to achieve secure technical identity propagation, which differ slightly from the one we highlighted for Cloud Integration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-952649741"&gt;5. Usage scenarios with API Management:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To make this blog post engaging, we would like to introduce multiple patterns of usage, since there is no single &lt;EM&gt;“gold standard”&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; for implementing authentication in API Management. The right choice depends on the system landscape, security requirements, and integration goals. Below, we outline a few practical scenarios that illustrate different approaches. You are free to adjust the scenario based on your security needs:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1014301674"&gt;1. JWT Bearer Token injection (Client credentials authentication):&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this scenario, the client is responsible for obtaining an access token itself. This typically involves the client exchanging its client credentials of API Management's on-premise proxy component for a&amp;nbsp;JWT access token and presenting it as part of the API call. API Management then processes this token and propagates the corresponding identity further downstream through the destination, Cloud Connector, and finally to the backend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt; While this approach is relatively straightforward, it places the responsibility of managing OAuth credentials and tokens directly on the client. Therefore, it should not be relied upon as the sole security mechanism. It is strongly recommended to validate the JWT on the API Management layer (or downstream) and ensure that it contains the expected claims (such as issuer, audience, scope, or custom claims like the target client_id) before granting access. This ensures that the token has not only been issued by BTP's XSUAA&amp;nbsp; but also carries the correct authorization context for your APIs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pre-requisite(s):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Make sure that you have created a service instance of the '&lt;U&gt;API Management, API portal&lt;/U&gt;'&amp;nbsp; service with the '&lt;U&gt;on-premise-connectivity&lt;/U&gt;' service plan.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-25 at 6.31.33 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304873iCA3CB132EEBCB1AC/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-25 at 6.31.33 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-25 at 6.31.33 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-817788169"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. API Key injection (Credential abstraction for clients):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this setup, the client application supplies an &lt;STRONG&gt;API Key&lt;/STRONG&gt; when calling API Management in addition to any other security mechanism. Behind the scenes, the API Proxy is configured to exchange fixed technical credentials with the Identity Provider (BTP XSUAA) to obtain an access token. This approach helps ensure that the sensitive technical credentials — the ones that need to be propagated — remain hidden from the client, thereby strengthening security.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To make matters more interesting, in our walkthrough, we will not rely on a basic &lt;EM&gt;client credentials &lt;/EM&gt;grant type. Instead, we will demonstrate a &lt;STRONG&gt;certificate-based token exchange&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where API Management presents a client certificate to XSUAA (via OAuth2 with mutual TLS) to obtain the token. This pattern is increasingly popular in enterprise landscapes because it provides stronger binding between client identity and issued tokens (&lt;A href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;RFC 8705&lt;/A&gt;), without ever exposing the client secret, while still abstracting the complexity from the consuming client.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pre-requisite(s):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;a) Ensure that the &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/activating-developer-hub" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Developer Hub&lt;/A&gt; is enabled and that you can create product subscriptions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;b) Ensure you have a service key enabled for &lt;U&gt;X.509&lt;/U&gt; certificate authentication. Copy the generated client_id. You can follow &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/on-premise-connectivity-plan" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/A&gt; guide to set it up, and then refer to step 3.3 in our previous article to create a PFX/P12 file that bundles the certificate and key together.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 4.43.24 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305676i60BF448692BBB8E1/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 4.43.24 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 4.43.24 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;c) Ensure that the PFX file is uploaded to a keystore from the 'Certificates' section.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 6.22.53 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306064i07D1A5304BE26380/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 6.22.53 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 6.22.53 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-621274664"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Client Certificate-based Authentication:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this scenario, the consuming client application presents an &lt;STRONG&gt;external client certificate&lt;/STRONG&gt; directly to the API Management runtime when invoking an API. The API Management host validates the certificate against its trust store and, based on pre-configured certificate-to-credential mapping, resolves the call to a &lt;STRONG&gt;fixed technical credential&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This design is particularly useful in system-to-system integrations where client identities are represented by certificates instead of (/in addition to) tokens or API Keys, as the certificate itself acts as the authentication factor. Internally, the mapped technical user is then propagated through to the BTP Destination, Cloud Connector, and ultimately to the backend system using the same mechanisms as in the earlier scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This approach is especially appealing when clients cannot (or should not) handle OAuth flows, but are capable of securely storing and presenting a client certificate. However, it requires careful lifecycle management of certificates (renewal, rotation, and trust configuration) to ensure uninterrupted connectivity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pre-requisite(s):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make sure you are configured for &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/request-for-two-way-ssl-certificate" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;certificate-based&lt;/A&gt; authentication. You can then manage your clients’ certificate chains in the Trust Store as a convenient self-service feature.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ensure you can read the '&lt;SPAN&gt;ConnectionProperties&lt;/SPAN&gt;' and '&lt;SPAN&gt;ClientProperties&lt;/SPAN&gt;' property variables. You will need to create an operations &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/tls-ssl-connection-information-variables" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ticket&lt;/A&gt; to do so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s examine each of these scenarios in detail. Please note that this is not a &lt;EM&gt;step-by-step&lt;/EM&gt; guide; rather, we will focus on highlighting only the key steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-166595721"&gt;6. Scenario#1 (Client credentials Authentication) - API Provider and Proxy configurations:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s review the essential API Provider and Proxy configurations required to enable propagation of the 'SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication' header.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Create an &lt;U&gt;Extract Variable&lt;/U&gt; policy like so (typically on the 'PreFlow' step) to extract the JWT token from the Authorization request and store it in a variable to be referenced later.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Extract content from the request or response messages, including headers, URI paths, JSON/XML payloads, form parameters, and query parameters --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ExtractVariables async="true" continueOnError="false" enabled="false" xmlns='http://www.sap.com/apimgmt'&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;Header name="Authorization"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Pattern ignoreCase="true"&amp;gt;Bearer {sapapim.jwt}&amp;lt;/Pattern&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Header&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;Source&amp;gt;request&amp;lt;/Source&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ExtractVariables&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. After this step, use a &lt;U&gt;Verify JWT&lt;/U&gt; policy to verify the signatures on the JWT as well as any standard and custom claims. Follow &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/blog-series-json-web-tokens-jwt-verification-using-sap-cloud-platform-api/ba-p/13419698" target="_self"&gt;this&lt;/A&gt; blog series to learn more about JWT verification capabilities.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Verify JWT TOken --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;VerifyJWT async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" xmlns="http://www.sap.com/apimgmt"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Algorithm&amp;gt;RS256&amp;lt;/Algorithm&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Source&amp;gt;sapapim.jwt&amp;lt;/Source&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;PublicKey&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Value ref="jwt.publickey"/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/PublicKey&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Subject ref="apim.subject"/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Issuer ref="apim.issuer"/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Audience ref="apim.issuer"/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;AdditionalClaims&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/AdditionalClaims&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/VerifyJWT&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Next, create an &lt;U&gt;AssignMessage&lt;/U&gt; policy like so to inject the '&lt;EM&gt;SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication&lt;/EM&gt;' header with the variable captured from the previous step, and make sure to remove the '&lt;EM&gt;Authorization&lt;/EM&gt;' header.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- This policy can be used to create or modify the standard HTTP request and response messages --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;AssignMessage async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" xmlns='http://www.sap.com/apimgmt'&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;Remove&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;Headers&amp;gt;
		     &amp;lt;Header name="Authorization"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Header&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/Headers&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/Remove&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;Set&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;Headers&amp;gt;
		     &amp;lt;Header name="SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication"&amp;gt;Bearer {sapapim.accessToken}&amp;lt;/Header&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/Headers&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/Set&amp;gt; 
	&amp;lt;IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;AssignTo createNew="false" type="request"&amp;gt;request&amp;lt;/AssignTo&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/AssignMessage&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;4. Finally, ensure that the API Provider’s &lt;EM&gt;authentication&lt;/EM&gt; setting is configured as &lt;U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;None&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/U&gt; rather than &lt;EM&gt;Principal Propagation&lt;/EM&gt;. This is the very configuration we applied for the SOAP Adapter scenario discussed in the previous blog post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 3.05.38 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305303i5753771BD1BFE32E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 3.05.38 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 3.05.38 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;5. Let's get down to testing now. The first step would be to get an access token from the authorization server's (XSUAA) token endpoint.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl --location --request POST 'https://&amp;lt;subdomain&amp;gt;.authentication.&amp;lt;region&amp;gt;.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --user '&amp;lt;client_id&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;client_secret&amp;gt;' \
  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;6. Copy the access token from the result of the call above and invoke the API Proxy by presenting the Bearer token in the Authorization header.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-abap"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl --location --request GET 'https://&amp;lt;apim_base_url&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;your_api_path&amp;gt;' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer &amp;lt;access_token&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":white_heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✅&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Assuming that the rest of your configurations are intact, the call should complete successfully and return the expected backend records.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;7. To validate the token handshake and X.509 certificate generation, refer to the verification steps detailed in Step 4.1 in our &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/unravelling-the-technical-user-propagation-scenarios-in-sap-integration/ba-p/14182016" target="_self"&gt;linked&lt;/A&gt; blog post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--29917784"&gt;7. Scenario#2 (APIKey injection) - Proxy configuration:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this scenario, the client credentials will not be exposed directly to the client. Instead, we inject the required client_id as a custom attribute within the Product Subscription. During runtime, this identifier is dynamically retrieved via a policy and used to obtain an access token from the authorization server&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Log in to your Developer Hub, create a product subscription for your target API. Navigate to the Custom Attribute tab and create an attribute called&lt;U&gt; 'x_client_id'&lt;/U&gt; and place the client_id copied from step 2.b. as the Value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 6.57.16 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/305681i492F9116AB62D50F/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 6.57.16 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 6.57.16 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. You may choose to follow the same workflow demonstrated in Scenario 1. In addition, an important step is to configure the &lt;U&gt;Verify API Key&lt;/U&gt; policy, for example, in the PreFlow segment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;!--Specify in the APIKey element where to look for the variable containing the api key--&amp;gt; 
&amp;lt;VerifyAPIKey async='true' continueOnError='false' enabled='true' 
xmlns='http://www.sap.com/apimgmt'&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;APIKey ref='request.header.apikey'/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/VerifyAPIKey&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Next, add an &lt;U&gt;AccessEntity&lt;/U&gt; policy to get hold of a reference to the 'application's' attributes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- this policy can be used to retrieve all details of an entity(application, API Product, company, company developer, consumer key and developer) --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;AccessEntity async="true" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" xmlns='http://www.sap.com/apimgmt'&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;!-- the name of the type of entity to be retrieved --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;EntityType value="app"/&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;!-- The value that identifies the specific entity whose profile should be retrieved. The ref attribute identifies the variable that provides the source of the identifier. 
	The type identifies the EntityType populated by the referenced variable --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;EntityIdentifier ref="request.header.apikey" type="consumerkey"/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/AccessEntity&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. Then add an &lt;U&gt;ExtractVariable&lt;/U&gt; policy to parse and extract the value of the custom attribute defined in the previous step.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Extract content from the request or response messages, including headers, URI paths, JSON/XML payloads, form parameters, and query parameters --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ExtractVariables async="true" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" xmlns='http://www.sap.com/apimgmt'&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;!-- the source variable which should be parsed --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;Source&amp;gt;AccessEntity.name-of-the-AccessEntity-policy-here&amp;lt;/Source&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;!-- Specifies the XML-formatted message from which the value of the variable will be extracted --&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;XMLPayload&amp;gt;
    	&amp;lt;!-- Specifies variable to which the extracted value will be assigned --&amp;gt;
    	&amp;lt;Variable name="x-client-id" type="string"&amp;gt;
    		&amp;lt;!-- Specifies the XPath defined for the variable --&amp;gt;
    		&amp;lt;XPath&amp;gt;/App/Attributes/Attribute[Name='x_client_id']/Value/text()&amp;lt;/XPath&amp;gt;
   	    &amp;lt;/Variable&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/XMLPayload&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ExtractVariables&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;5. After this step, we add a small script to construct the URL-encoded form payload in preparation for the token retrieval step. Notice that we &lt;U&gt;have not&lt;/U&gt; used the client secret attribute at all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-javascript"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function getFormElement(name,value){
    return name + "=" + encodeURIComponent(value);
}

function createOAuthRequest(){
    return getFormElement("grant_type","client_credentials")
                + "&amp;amp;" + getFormElement("client_id", context.getVariable("x-client-id")) ;
}

context.setVariable("sapapim.tokenRequest", createOAuthRequest());&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;6. We will follow this up with a &lt;U&gt;ServiceCallout&lt;/U&gt; policy to make a POST request to the '.&lt;EM&gt;cert...&lt;/EM&gt;' token endpoint. Notice that we are attaching the certificate of the service key retrieved in step 2.c. by referencing it from the keystore.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ServiceCallout async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" xmlns="http://www.sap.com/apimgmt"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Request clearPayload="true"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Set&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Payload contentType="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"&amp;gt;{sapapim.tokenRequest}&amp;lt;/Payload&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Verb&amp;gt;POST&amp;lt;/Verb&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Set&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/IgnoreUnresolvedVariables&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Request&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Response&amp;gt;sapapim.tokenResponse&amp;lt;/Response&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Timeout&amp;gt;30000&amp;lt;/Timeout&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;HTTPTargetConnection&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;URL&amp;gt;https://&amp;lt;tenant-dentifier&amp;gt;.authentication.cert.&amp;lt;region&amp;gt;.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token&amp;lt;/URL&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;SSLInfo&amp;gt; 
                 &amp;lt;Enabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/Enabled&amp;gt; 
                &amp;lt;ClientAuthEnabled&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/ClientAuthEnabled&amp;gt; 
                &amp;lt;KeyStore&amp;gt;KEYSTORE-NAME-GOES-HERE&amp;lt;/KeyStore&amp;gt; 
                &amp;lt;KeyAlias&amp;gt;CERTIFICATE-NAME-GOES-HERE&amp;lt;/KeyAlias&amp;gt; 
        &amp;lt;/SSLInfo&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/HTTPTargetConnection&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ServiceCallout&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;7. Finally, retrieve the access token and attach it to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication&lt;/EM&gt; header, as demonstrated in step 3 of scenario 1.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;8. To test this setup, modify the curl command from scenario 1 to add the APIKey header attribute, like so:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl --location --request GET 'https://&amp;lt;apim_base_url&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;your_api_path&amp;gt;' \ 
--header "APIKey: &amp;lt;your_api_key&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-120823068"&gt;8. Scenario#3 (Client certificate-based authentication) - Proxy configuration:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The critical security step in this scenario is that the client presents its certificate, which API Management validates against the trusted certificates stored in its Trust Store. This validation ensures that only clients with a recognized and trusted certificate can establish communication, thereby guaranteeing both authenticity and trust in the interaction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When the 'ConnectionProperties' and 'ClientProperties' attributes are enabled, as described in the prerequisites section, you can also access key certificate details such as the Issuer DN and Client CN. For this scenario, we assume that the API Administrator maintains an access control list mapping a predefined set of certificate Common Names to unique client_ids. This ensures that the technical identifier is propagated only when a matching client certificate is presented.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's set this up.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Create a &lt;U&gt;Key Value Map&lt;/U&gt; and maintain a table mapping the common name of the client to the designated client_id.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 3.20.27 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306107i8771F75CD2D9D143/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 3.20.27 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 3.20.27 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. Construct a &lt;U&gt;KeyValueMapOperations&lt;/U&gt; policy that dynamically retrieves the 'tls.client.s.dn' property from the presented certificate, looks up the Key Value Map created in the above step, and assigns the value of the client_id to a variable called 'x_client_id'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-markup"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;KeyValueMapOperations mapIdentifier="TechnicalAuthenticationMap" async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="false" xmlns="http://www.sap.com/apimgmt"&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Get assignTo="x_client_id" index="1"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;Key&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;Parameter ref ="tls.client.s.dn"/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/Key&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/Get&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;Scope&amp;gt;environment&amp;lt;/Scope&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/KeyValueMapOperations&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;3. Repeat steps 5, 6, and 7 from Scenario 2 to generate an access token and assign it to the target header.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4. To test the invocation, adjust the curl command to pass the client certificate&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl --location --request GET 'https://&amp;lt;apim_base_url&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;your_api_path&amp;gt;' \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer &amp;lt;access_token&amp;gt;" \
  --header "APIKey: &amp;lt;your_api_key&amp;gt;" \
  --cert &amp;lt;path_to_certificate&amp;gt;.pfx --cert-type P12 --pass &amp;lt;pfx_password&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":clapping_hands:"&gt;👏&lt;/span&gt;Congratulations on getting this far!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--75690437"&gt;9. Summary:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The three API Management scenarios illustrate different approaches for &lt;STRONG&gt;technical user propagation &lt;/STRONG&gt;using the&lt;STRONG&gt; SAP-Connectivity-Technical-Authentication header&lt;/STRONG&gt;. In the first approach, the client directly provides credentials to obtain an access token, exposing sensitive information. The second approach leverages API Management to propagate technical credentials internally, keeping them hidden from the client and simplifying integration. The third approach uses mutual TLS and X.509 certificates to securely propagate the technical user identity from API Management through the API Provider to the backend system, ensuring end-to-end authentication without exposing internal credentials.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;I've been spending quite some time recently diving deep into SAP Build Work Zone security, and let me tell you, it's a journey. Terms like &lt;STRONG&gt;#IAS&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;#BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt; Subaccount &lt;STRONG&gt;#trusts&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and &lt;STRONG&gt;#ShadowUsers&lt;/STRONG&gt; can sometimes feel like a maze.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But then, an analogy clicked for me - the &lt;STRONG&gt;#DigitalMall&lt;/STRONG&gt; and suddenly, the whole complex architecture started making perfect sense. I wanted to share this breakdown with all of you, hoping it helps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's imagine SAP Build Work Zone as a bustling, modern Digital Mall, where users (you, the &lt;STRONG&gt;#shoppers&lt;/STRONG&gt;) come to access various &lt;STRONG&gt;#stores&lt;/STRONG&gt; (business applications) and "services" (collaboration features). Every security layer has a purpose, just like every part of a well run mall&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;#TheGrandOpening&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Understanding this Digital Mall's Foundation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before anyone even walks in, the mall has a master plan and a way to organize its offerings:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Subaccount&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Think of this as the Mall's Main Entrance &amp;amp; Security Gate. It's the primary gateway, controlling who can even step foot inside your digital space. It's where core permissions are managed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Work Zone Tenant&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This is your specific, unique instance of the Mall itself - your personalized shopping experience!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; #&lt;STRONG&gt;ContentManager&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This acts like the Mall's Central Directory or Information Kiosk. It lists all the "stores" (your business applications) available within the mall, helping shoppers find what they need&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Content Providers&lt;/STRONG&gt;: These are the "Department Stores" (like SAP S/4HANA&lt;BR /&gt;SuccessFactors) or even smaller "Boutiques" (your custom applications). They reside outside your immediate mall structure but integrate seamlessly, making their offerings available inside your Work Zone.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Stepping Inside: Your Identity &amp;amp; Basic Mall Access&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, for the really crucial part: how does a "shopper" (your user) actually get into the Digital Mall, and how is their identity validated at the main entrance?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;#SAPCloudIdentityServices&lt;/STRONG&gt; - Identity Authentication (IAS): The Mall's Central Security System / ID Proxy&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is the mandatory first stop for any user trying to enter your Work Zone mall. &lt;STRONG&gt;#IAS&lt;/STRONG&gt; is your primary &lt;STRONG&gt;#IdentityProvider&lt;/STRONG&gt; [IDP]&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;#Proxy&lt;/STRONG&gt; Mode: If your organization uses its own Corporate IdP (like Azure AD, Okta), IAS acts as a clever proxy. You authenticate against your corporate system, and IAS then receives that verified identity, federating it onward in a way Work Zone understands. It's seamless, you just show your corporate ID.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;#TheDigitalIdCard&lt;/STRONG&gt; (SAML Assertion / OIDC Token): Once authenticated, IAS issues a secure token. This token is packed with vital information, essentially your digital "ID Card" that gets you past the main gate:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;#SubjectNameIdentifier&lt;/STRONG&gt; (SNI): This is your main identifier (e.g., your Login Name or Employee ID). It's what the BTP Subaccount primarily uses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;#&lt;STRONG&gt;Assertion Attribute (often IAS UUID)&lt;/STRONG&gt;: This is a unique, stable, and persistent ID assigned by IAS. It's super important for internal Work Zone component communication later on, especially with the DWS (our "Community Center," which I'll cover in Part 2!)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;---&amp;gt; Other standard user attributes like email, first name, last name.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Subaccount Trust Configuration: The Main Gate's Agreement with IAS&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Your BTP Subaccount (the main gate) has a "trust agreement" with IAS. This allows it to confidently accept those digital ID cards (tokens) from IAS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; #&lt;STRONG&gt;The XSUAA Shadow User&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Your Mall Access Card. This is one of the most critical concepts&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When a user successfully authenticates via IAS for the first time, a "Shadow User" record is either created or identified in the BTP Subaccount's internal user list. Think of this as your personal "&lt;STRONG&gt;Mall Access Card&lt;/STRONG&gt;" record.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why is it needed? Even if IAS knows who you are, the BTP Subaccount needs its own local record (the shadow user) to attach BTP Role Collections to it. These &lt;STRONG&gt;role&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;collections&lt;/STRONG&gt; are your "&lt;STRONG&gt;Mall-wide Privileges&lt;/STRONG&gt;" (e.g., WorkZone_User, WorkZone_Admin) that determine what you can do across the whole Work Zone platform.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Crucial Point: If a shadow user doesn't exist (and automatic creation isn't enabled), login to Work Zone will fail because there is no local identity to attach permissions to.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Principal Propagation: Seamless Access to Department Stores!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once you're in the mall and launch an app from an On-Premise Backend System (like an S/4HANA Fiori app via SAP Cloud Connector), you don't want to log in again, right?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where ##&lt;STRONG&gt;Principal Propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt; comes in! Your identity (using the IAS SNI from the BTP trust) is seamlessly passed through the BTP Destination Service and SAP Cloud Connector directly to the backend system. The S/ 4HANA system then recognizes you and authorizes your access based on your roles within S/4HANA. It's like your Mall Access Card automatically opening the staff-only doors in a department store.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This is just the exciting first step of understanding Work Zone security. In Part 2, coming next.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Digital Workplace Service (DWS) (the Mall's Community Center).&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;User and User List Provisioning (how the Community Center gets its member lists).&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The critical differences between Internal vs. External Users (different types of Community Center members).&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;And how SCIM APIs are the "automated delivery trucks" for all this data!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Stay tuned for more insights, and in the meantime, I'd love to hear your thoughts or questions on this first part in the comments below!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Happy Work Zone-ing!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Lets connect and learn together &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":victory_hand:"&gt;✌️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1737037167"&gt;1. Introduction:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the rapidly evolving landscape of enterprise integration, authentication and authorization are no longer mere checkpoints — they are the guardians of trust between systems. Within SAP Integration Suite, the &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion &amp;amp; JWT Bearer grant types&lt;/STRONG&gt; stand out as a &lt;U&gt;powerful&lt;/U&gt; yet often &lt;U&gt;less-understood&lt;/U&gt; mechanisms for secure API access, especially in hybrid enterprise landscapes where &lt;U&gt;user identity&lt;/U&gt; is federated across multiple systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have ever stared at an &lt;U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/U&gt; parameter as a supported grant type and wondered &lt;EM&gt;how this elegant string actually translates into a trusted access token&lt;/EM&gt;, you are not alone. Many integration developers and security practitioners have encountered it — often through trial, error, and a bit of documentation spelunking.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this article, we’ll go beyond the surface. We’ll explore:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What OAuth2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion is really doing under the hood&lt;/STRONG&gt; — and why it exists in the first place.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How this plays into SAP Integration Suite’s XSUAA and the broader BTP security model&lt;/STRONG&gt;, particularly in securing IFlows and APIs within SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Practical configuration patterns and gotchas&lt;/STRONG&gt; that can save you hours of troubleshooting.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A few examples&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;of exchanging a signed SAML assertion for an OAuth access token, demystifying the process step by step.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1540523662"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. When is the OAuth2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion relevant for an Integration Developer?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Traditionally, most communication handled by &lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; has been &lt;STRONG&gt;system-to-system&lt;/STRONG&gt;, where a technical client or application authenticates itself, and the &lt;STRONG&gt;user context&lt;/STRONG&gt; is irrelevant. In such scenarios, the &lt;STRONG&gt;Client Credentials&lt;/STRONG&gt; grant type has been sufficient, since all that mattered was verifying that the calling system was trusted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But this picture is evolving. Today, &lt;STRONG&gt;IFlows and APIs are two sides of the same coin&lt;/STRONG&gt;: while IFlows orchestrate integration logic, APIs expose functionality that must often act on behalf of a specific user. Increasingly, organizations expect &lt;STRONG&gt;end-user identity and authorizations&lt;/STRONG&gt; established in one system (e.g., via a corporate IdP or another SAP application) to be &lt;STRONG&gt;seamlessly propagated into Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; and carried forward all the way to the backend system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is exactly where the &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth 2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion&lt;/STRONG&gt; grant type becomes relevant. It provides a standards-based mechanism to exchange a trusted user identity assertion for an access token in Cloud Integration. That access token can then be forwarded downstream, ensuring that the &lt;STRONG&gt;original user’s context&lt;/STRONG&gt; — along with their authorizations — is preserved across system boundaries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For the integration developer, this means that Cloud Integration is no longer just a technical middleware layer. It becomes an active participant in &lt;STRONG&gt;identity propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enabling end-to-end security models that align with enterprise zero-trust principles and modern API-driven architectures.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="100%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":pushpin:"&gt;📌&lt;/span&gt;To demonstrate the concepts required for achieving identity propagation, this article utilizes the SAP Cloud Connector, X.509 certificates, and backend configurations that I have already explained in detail in &lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/unravelling-the-technical-user-propagation-scenarios-in-sap-integration/ba-p/14182016?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_new"&gt;my earlier blog post on technical user propagation&lt;/A&gt;. While that post specifically focuses on &lt;STRONG&gt;technical user&lt;/STRONG&gt; propagation, the configuration steps are not very different for the &lt;STRONG&gt;user propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt; scenario described here. I therefore recommend that readers familiarize themselves with those concepts first, as they provide a solid foundation for this discussion.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":pushpin:"&gt;📌&lt;/span&gt;One of the scenarios in &lt;STRONG&gt;this&lt;/STRONG&gt; blog post will also refer back to the earlier article to highlight the applicability of the &lt;STRONG&gt;authorization code grant type&lt;/STRONG&gt; in Cloud Integration—particularly when authorizing users from a corporate IdP such as Entra ID, using &lt;STRONG&gt;OpenID Connect&lt;/STRONG&gt;–based federation in conjunction with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services (SAP IAS)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. For a broader perspective, I also suggest referring to &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/single-sign-on-to-sap-cloud-integration-cpi-runtime-from-an-external/ba-p/13655108?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_self"&gt;my linked blog post&lt;/A&gt;, which explains single sign-on to SAP Cloud Integration runtime from an external application.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Taken together, these resources provide a complete 360-degree view of securing and implementing user-linked flows in SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1344010157"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Full support for OAuth2.0 SAML Bearer Assertion in Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is important to emphasize that SAP Cloud Integration fully supports the OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion flow both at the '&lt;STRONG&gt;sender'&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and at the '&lt;STRONG&gt;receiver' side&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On the &lt;STRONG&gt;inbound side&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Cloud Integration can authenticate and authorize incoming requests based on the &lt;STRONG&gt;user’s identity&lt;/STRONG&gt;, ensuring that calls made to IFlows are evaluated not just at the technical client level but also with the context of the end user. This enables developers to enforce fine-grained authorization rules and maintain auditability of user actions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;The following simplified illustration shows how OAuth2 SAML and JWT Bearer grants act as the enablers that make this flow possible.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="DIAGRAM 1.drawio.png" style="width: 450px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/307579iEC0BC1F28C5D7290/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="DIAGRAM 1.drawio.png" alt="DIAGRAM 1.drawio.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You can specify these grant types while creating a service instance for the &lt;EM&gt;Process Integration Runtime.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Here's an example snippet to create a service instance with the SAMLBearer and JWTBearer grant types" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306947i83528CB7C87A87A6/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-08-29 at 9.01.40 PM.png" alt="Here's an example snippet to create a service instance with the SAMLBearer and JWTBearer grant types" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Here's an example snippet to create a service instance with the SAMLBearer and JWTBearer grant types&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On the &lt;STRONG&gt;outbound side&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Cloud Integration can establish an &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion&lt;/STRONG&gt; when calling downstream systems such as &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP SuccessFactors, SAP S/4HANA Cloud,&amp;nbsp; S/4HANA On-Premise&lt;/STRONG&gt; (wrapped under the familiar &lt;STRONG&gt;Principal Propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt; pattern), etc.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="DIAGRAM 2.drawio.png" style="width: 450px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/307580iD6FA24559A181645/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="DIAGRAM 2.drawio.png" alt="DIAGRAM 2.drawio.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This capability is not new. Even in the days of &lt;STRONG&gt;Neo&lt;/STRONG&gt;, Cloud Integration has supported the &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth2 SAML Bearer flow&lt;/STRONG&gt; for connecting to SAP SuccessFactors — both through technical credentials and via user-based assertions using an email identifier. The topic has been well covered in the community, including several blog posts authored by my colleague, Deepak Deshpande. (&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-cloud-integration-principal-propagation-with-successfactors-odata-v2/ba-p/13368194" target="_self"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-cloud-integration-oauth2-saml-bearer-x-509-certificate-authentication/bc-p/13501610" target="_self"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 4.36.51 PM.png" style="width: 386px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/307572i9314CEF8EE52DBF2/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 4.36.51 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 4.36.51 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Beyond this, any system within the BTP ecosystem that leverages the &lt;STRONG&gt;BTP Connectivity Service&lt;/STRONG&gt;—including &lt;STRONG&gt;S/4HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;—can take part in the identity propagation chain. In the sections that follow, we will explore some of the possibilities this enables, such as &lt;STRONG&gt;chaining into another iFlow&lt;/STRONG&gt; (within the same or a different subaccount) or invoking a service exposed through &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/transitioning-to-odata-provisioning-capability-in-sap-integration-suite/transitioning-odata-provisioning-from-sap-btp-serverless-runtime-to-sap-integration-suite" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;OData&lt;/A&gt; Provisioning&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 4.42.11 PM.png" style="width: 328px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/307573i309866CD89F19087/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 4.42.11 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 4.42.11 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This dual capability positions Cloud Integration as a true enabler of &lt;STRONG&gt;end-to-end user identity propagation&lt;/STRONG&gt;, bridging the gap between modern identity-aware APIs and enterprise backend systems, while ensuring security models remain consistent across landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1147496652"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. Understanding the "&lt;EM&gt;SAML&lt;/EM&gt;" in OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The term OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion&amp;nbsp;(RFC:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7522" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;RFC 7522&lt;/A&gt;)&amp;nbsp;can often feel confusing at first glance, particularly with the placement of the word '&lt;STRONG&gt;SAML&lt;/STRONG&gt;'.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"&lt;EM&gt;Where is SAML in this picture?", &lt;/EM&gt;you may ask,&amp;nbsp; as practitioners know for a fact that SAP BTP is based on &lt;U&gt;OAuth2.0&lt;/U&gt; and &lt;U&gt;OIDC-based&lt;/U&gt; security standards. Let's unpack this.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Fundamentally, classical&lt;STRONG&gt; Identity Providers (IdP) &lt;/STRONG&gt;like Entra ID,&amp;nbsp;SAP IAS, or corporate ADFS are designed to issue signed &lt;EM&gt;assertions&lt;/EM&gt; asserting a user’s identity and attributes. These assertions are trusted pieces of information that downstream systems can use to authenticate a user without requiring them to re-enter credentials.&amp;nbsp; In addition, in an enterprise integration landscape, the Identity Provider role is &lt;U&gt;not limited&lt;/U&gt; to classical IdPs. Connectivity and middleware components themselves can also &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;act as&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;an Identity Provider and trusted issuers of SAML assertions. The process of SAML to OAuth2 token exchange sequence is as follows :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-alpha"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The SAML assertion issued by the assumed Identity Provider acts as a '&lt;STRONG&gt;credential wrapper&lt;/STRONG&gt;' — it carries the authenticated user identity, roles, and authorizations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;Authorization Server&lt;/STRONG&gt; (in BTP Integration Suite tenant,&amp;nbsp; i.e., &lt;STRONG&gt;XSUAA&lt;/STRONG&gt;) consumes this signed assertion and, if trusted and valid, exchanges it for an OAuth 2.0 access token, per the RFC spec (&lt;A href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7522" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;RFC 7522&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;This access token, representing the user identity, can then be presented to the target system, which, based on its security directive, can &lt;STRONG&gt;authenticate&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;authorize&lt;/STRONG&gt; the identity from the token.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's look at a few notable examples where this process is at play:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-list-style-type-lower-roman"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The classical approach to setting up a SAML trust between an &lt;STRONG&gt;Identity Provider&lt;/STRONG&gt; and a &lt;STRONG&gt;Service Provider&lt;/STRONG&gt; lends itself to setting up for the OAuth2 bearer exchange flow, particularly between Entra ID and SAP BTP, based on the '&lt;U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;on-behalf-of&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/U&gt;' directive. Explained so elegantly in these two blog posts authored by &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/principal-propagation-in-a-multi-cloud-solution-between-microsoft-azure-and/ba-p/13479950" target="_self"&gt;Martin&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/principal-propagation-between-azure-ad-and-an-on-premise-sap-system-through/bc-p/13503735" target="_self"&gt;Niklas&lt;/A&gt;, respectively, applicable for services secured by the BTP XSUAA Service.&lt;BR /&gt;Note that this classical 'trust' setup also equally applies between, say, Entra ID and &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP NetWeaver&lt;/STRONG&gt; ABAP AS. Martin Pankraz and I demonstrated the setup in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-members/integrating-low-code-solutions-with-microsoft-using-sap-integration-suite/ba-p/13789298" target="_self"&gt;this&lt;/A&gt; blog post.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP Connectivity Service&lt;/STRONG&gt; can generate signed SAML assertions when bridging secure connections to backend systems. For example, the BTP Destination type '&lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth2SAMLBearerAssertion&lt;/STRONG&gt;' leverages this principal. See example below:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 4.46.21 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/307574i4B305C0237472715/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 4.46.21 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 4.46.21 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;API Management's&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;gateway acts as an identity provider that injects a user’s authenticated identity into a signed assertion to downstream services. Customers frequently use policy templates like &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/policytemplate/SAPCloudFoundrySAML2OAuthFlow" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;this&lt;/A&gt; one listed in the &lt;U&gt;API Business Accelerator Hub&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cloud Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; itself uses the BTP Connectivity Services' principles by providing out-of-the-box Security Materials that support OAuth2 SAML Bearer exchange. We'll get to more of this bit in this very blog post.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This means that within the BTP ecosystem, the ability to &lt;EM&gt;mint&lt;/EM&gt; a signed SAML assertion is not confined to a single component but distributed across the connectivity and security services that are orchestrating secure communication flows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Put simply, the "&lt;STRONG&gt;SAML&lt;/STRONG&gt;"&amp;nbsp;in OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion is the &lt;STRONG&gt;trusted identity assertion format&lt;/STRONG&gt; that enables one system to confidently vouch for a user’s identity to another. When combined with OAuth 2.0, it bridges the gap between &lt;STRONG&gt;user-centric authentication (SAML)&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;token-based authorization (OAuth)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On that note, you may have come across the &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth2 JWT Bearer&lt;/STRONG&gt; grant type as well. Let’s weave that into our context.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-950983147"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. The OAuth2 JWT Bearer grant type&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the OAuth2 SAML Bearer grant type leverages a SAML 2.0 assertion to obtain an access token, its close cousin — the &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth2 JWT Bearer&lt;/STRONG&gt; grant type — follows a similar token exchange pattern but uses a &lt;STRONG&gt;signed JSON Web Token (JWT)&lt;/STRONG&gt; instead of SAML. In the context of SAP BTP XSUAA, the JWT Bearer flow is often chosen when the identity assertion is already in JWT format, such as when integrating with systems that natively issue JWTs (e.g., other BTP applications, certain identity providers, or trusted microservices).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, for the purposes of this article, we will not be focusing on the JWT Bearer approach. The reason is that &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Integration only partially supports it&lt;/STRONG&gt; — JWT Bearer can be used when authenticating inbound requests to an iFlow, but it is &lt;STRONG&gt;not available as a selectable option in the “Security Material”&lt;/STRONG&gt; when making outbound calls from Cloud Integration to a target system. As such, its utility is currently more limited in end-to-end integration scenarios compared to the SAML Bearer flow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-754469642"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Configurations needed to achieve OAuth2 SAML Bearer exchange&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since we are on the topic of the role of &lt;STRONG&gt;Identity Providers&lt;/STRONG&gt; (&lt;EM&gt;actual&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;assumed&lt;/EM&gt;) during an OAuth2 SAML Bearer handshake, let us weave in the role of the &lt;STRONG&gt;Trust Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt; setting in the BTP Cockpit — a subject that is often less understood in the context of SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Why is this less understood?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In BTP landscapes, the &lt;EM&gt;Trust Configuration&lt;/EM&gt; in the cockpit is primarily associated with &lt;STRONG&gt;browser-based BTP applications&lt;/STRONG&gt; that require coupling between an &lt;STRONG&gt;Identity Provider (IdP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; (such as SAP IAS or a corporate IdP) and the &lt;STRONG&gt;Service Provider (SP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; role of the application. This trust relationship governs how users log in interactively to applications and how their identities are federated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This implies that at the &lt;STRONG&gt;design time (UI) level&lt;/STRONG&gt;, configuring the Trust relationship ensures that developers and administrators can access the Integration Suite tools via their corporate IDP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, customers often struggle to apply the same concept when it comes to the &lt;STRONG&gt;runtime&lt;/STRONG&gt; — where iFlows and APIs need to be authenticated and authorized via &lt;STRONG&gt;user identities&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This is precisely where dialing in the &lt;STRONG&gt;correct runtime configurations for OAuth2 SAML Bearer exchange&lt;/STRONG&gt; becomes critical.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To keep this practical, let’s break the discussion into multiple scenarios and examine the configurations required for each. Here is a table that captures the different scenarios covered in this blog post :&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="17.02470461868958%"&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="82.97529538131043%"&gt;&amp;nbsp;[INBOUND] Invoking an IFlow via BTP Destination / Connectivity Service&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="17.02470461868958%"&gt;Scenario 2 variant 1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="82.97529538131043%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Scenario 1 + [OUTBOUND] Using Security Material to make an outbound OAuth2 SAML Bearer call&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="17.02470461868958%"&gt;Scenario 2 variant 2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="82.97529538131043%"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Authorization Code grant type&amp;nbsp; +&amp;nbsp;[OUTBOUND] Using Security Material to make an outbound OAuth2 SAML Bearer call&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-816121575"&gt;6.1. Scenario 1: [INBOUND] Invoking an IFlow via a BTP Destination:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are use cases where a &lt;STRONG&gt;Fiori/UI5 application&lt;/STRONG&gt; deployed on BTP uses a destination to call an IFlow, ensuring the user’s identity (via OAuth2 SAML Bearer) is securely propagated into the integration layer. Similarly, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt; can leverage destinations in its Actions framework to trigger IFlows as part of an automated workflow, often requiring identity propagation so that downstream systems know which user initiated the process. Beyond these, other scenarios include &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Work Zone&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Launchpad&lt;/STRONG&gt; extensions invoking integration services, as well as custom applications running in the Cloud Foundry runtime consuming iFlows via destinations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In practice, customers often face challenges in identifying the correct configurations to make this scenario work. Below is a detailed cluster of the configurations involved.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth token endpoint address:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Customers often assume the default '&lt;EM&gt;.../oauth/token&lt;/EM&gt;' endpoint applies universally, but this is not the case. OAuthSAMLBearer looks for the '.../&lt;EM&gt;oauth/token/alias/&lt;/EM&gt;' endpoint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Exchange of trust between subaccounts&lt;/STRONG&gt; where the services reside.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implicit trust within the same subaccount:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Even if both services are in the same subaccount, an implicit trust relationship must still be established. This small step can save hours of troubleshooting.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BTP Destination and Integration Flow&lt;/STRONG&gt; settings to support OAuth2 SAML Bearer handshake.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;A quick walkthrough of the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Application Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt; template wizard building blocks, enabling an SAP Fiori application to validate everything completed so far.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is a solution blueprint of what we will put together:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="iflow diagrams-Page-4.drawio.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309417iB09768E7A05C5824/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="iflow diagrams-Page-4.drawio.png" alt="iflow diagrams-Page-4.drawio.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s review these configurations step by step.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;1. &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth token alias endpoint.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="9.595417114214108%"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-619608070"&gt;Step No&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="41.17436448263516%"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-423094565"&gt;Description&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="49.23021840315074%"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-226581060"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="9.595417114214108%"&gt;1.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="41.17436448263516%"&gt;Download the '&lt;STRONG&gt;SAML Metadata&lt;/STRONG&gt;' from the '&lt;STRONG&gt;Trust Configuration&lt;/STRONG&gt;' section of your BTP Cockpit&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="49.23021840315074%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 6.36.56 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/308275i5AE7A4A3711E75A1/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 6.36.56 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 6.36.56 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="9.595417114214108%"&gt;2.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="41.17436448263516%"&gt;Locate and copy the value of the '&lt;STRONG&gt;entityID&lt;/STRONG&gt;' element from the downloaded XML file&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="49.23021840315074%"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 6.39.08 PM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/308276i4FFF8592D4B0944B/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 6.39.08 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 6.39.08 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="9.595417114214108%"&gt;3.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="41.17436448263516%"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Locate and copy the '&lt;STRONG&gt;Location&lt;/STRONG&gt;' element.

Scenario 2:&amp;nbsp; [OUTBOUND] Using Security Material to make an outbound OAuth2 SAML Bearer call&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;As described in section &lt;U&gt;3.b.2&lt;/U&gt;, we will now focus on leveraging Cloud Integration’s capability to use the generic OAuth2 SAML Bearer security material, rather than the ones targeting SuccessFactors, as they are already well covered in the community.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One might ask: &lt;EM&gt;how do we set up an environment that makes it simple to simulate and test the user flow&lt;/EM&gt;? The good news is that Scenario 1 has already given us the &lt;STRONG&gt;user interaction&lt;/STRONG&gt; layer. All we need to do now is &lt;STRONG&gt;chain&lt;/STRONG&gt; the IFlow we created earlier with another one, letting the &lt;STRONG&gt;outbound of the first serve as the inbound&lt;/STRONG&gt; of the second. This allows us to validate the flow end-to-end in both directions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="a53ju9.jpg" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309423iC989A0F6078E14D1/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="a53ju9.jpg" alt="a53ju9.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To keep the discourse engaging, we will explore yet another variant for testing the outbound OAuth2 SAML Bearer setup. Here, we’ll use Cloud Integration’s capability to trigger an &lt;STRONG&gt;Authorization Code&lt;/STRONG&gt; grant type exchange, simulating a real user login, and then build on that to invoke the OAuth2 SAML Bearer method.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6.2.1. Scenario 2 - Variant 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Here's the solution blueprint of the first variant, where we extend scenario 1 and &lt;EM&gt;chain&lt;/EM&gt; an intermediate IFlow with the main IFlow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="iflow diagrams-Page-5.drawio.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309471i90104E0050C12D36/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="iflow diagrams-Page-5.drawio.png" alt="iflow diagrams-Page-5.drawio.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The sequence of events from the client to Business Application Studio follows the same pattern as in Scenario 1. The difference here is that instead of directly calling the &lt;STRONG&gt;main IFlow&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&amp;nbsp; we have intentionally introduced an &lt;STRONG&gt;intermediate IFlow&lt;/STRONG&gt; (step callout 1 in the blueprint above), which is configured with OAuth2 SAML Bearer security material to eventually connect with the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;main IFlow&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Since the main IFlow accepts only the OAuth2 SAML grant type (step callout 2), this setup allows the connection to be seamlessly extended to the backend using Principal Propagation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regardless of whether the intermediate and main IFlows are in the same or separate subaccounts, a &lt;STRONG&gt;SAML trust&lt;/STRONG&gt; between the &lt;EM&gt;source&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;target&lt;/EM&gt; is &lt;STRONG&gt;mandatory&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as highlighted in Procedure 2 of Scenario 1.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's take a look at the key configuration steps:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="9.760394644115578%" height="58px"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--2039757580"&gt;Step No.&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="42.84707540521494%" height="58px"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2058696211"&gt;Description&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="47.39252995066949%" height="58px"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2030366397"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="9.760394644115578%" height="112px"&gt;1.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="42.84707540521494%" height="112px"&gt;Notice that&amp;nbsp; I've created a metadata called '&lt;STRONG&gt;self-trust&lt;/STRONG&gt;' with the &lt;EM&gt;entityDescriptor&lt;/EM&gt; for the subaccount.

Scenario 2 - Variant 2:&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Rather than using &lt;STRONG&gt;Business Application Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt; as the user-centric app to trigger the intermediate IFlow, we will instead leverage the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Authorization Code&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;grant type. From a technical perspective, the Authorization Code flow differs from the OAuth2 SAML Bearer grant; however, in principle, both achieve the same outcome:&lt;STRONG&gt; propagating a user session&lt;/STRONG&gt; within an OAuth access token.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This raises the question—&lt;EM&gt;how do we introduce the Authorization Code grant flow? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Cloud Integration natively &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-integration/sap-cloud-integration/deploying-oauth2-authorization-code" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;supports&lt;/A&gt; the Authorization Code grant type as security material. While it was originally introduced to support adapters such as &lt;STRONG&gt;Dropbox&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Microsoft 365&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which rely on this flow, we can extend its utility further. By attaching this &lt;STRONG&gt;security material&lt;/STRONG&gt; to any outbound call through the &lt;STRONG&gt;HTTP Receiver adapter&lt;/STRONG&gt;—and applying a small amount of scripting (see step 6.2.2.3)—we can retrieve an access token from the authorization code using the &lt;STRONG&gt;SecureStoreService&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/doc/471310fc71c94c2d913884e2ff1b4039/Cloud/en-US/com/sap/it/api/securestore/SecureStoreService.html#getAccesTokenForOauth2AuthorizationCodeCredential-java.lang.String-" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;API.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is a solution blueprint of what we aim to achieve:&lt;BR /&gt;For simplicity, a &lt;STRONG&gt;timer-based IFlow&lt;/STRONG&gt; will initiate an outbound call to the &lt;U&gt;intermediate&lt;/U&gt; IFlow, attaching an access token extracted from the security material (constructed via the &lt;STRONG&gt;authorization code&lt;/STRONG&gt; exchange)&amp;nbsp; that represents an authenticated user. This user may either be provisioned through the default Cloud Identity Service or authenticated via a corporate IdP such as Entra ID, as outlined in one of my &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/single-sign-on-to-sap-cloud-integration-cpi-runtime-from-an-external/ba-p/13655108" target="_self"&gt;earlier&lt;/A&gt; blog posts. The interaction sequence between the intermediate IFlow and the final IFlow remains unchanged.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="iflow diagrams-Page-3.drawio.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/310626i1029D34621866527/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="iflow diagrams-Page-3.drawio.png" alt="iflow diagrams-Page-3.drawio.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;6.2.2.1 First, let's go over the configuration steps to establish the authorization code:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="9.702828499820981%"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1833852892"&gt;Step No.&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="43.1077694235589%"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1637339387"&gt;Description&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="47.18940207662013%"&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1440825882"&gt;Screenshot&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="9.702828499820981%"&gt;1.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="43.1077694235589%"&gt;In your source subaccount, create a new &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;OAuth2 Authorization Code&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; security material.

The first sequence in the flow is a 'timer' step. To keep things simple, it just triggers off upon deployment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-07 at 4.59.43 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/310707i0859AFEA787C1E7D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-07 at 4.59.43 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-07 at 4.59.43 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;6.2.2.3. In the second step, we add a Groovy script that taps into the SecureStoreService API to read the &lt;EM&gt;Authorization Code&lt;/EM&gt; security material defined in the previous step. The script then exchanges the authorization code with the token endpoint to fetch a valid access token.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;import com.sap.gateway.ip.core.customdev.util.Message
import com.sap.it.api.securestore.SecureStoreService
import com.sap.it.api.ITApiFactory

def Message processData(Message message) {
    
    // Name of your OAuth2 Authorization Code credential (as defined in Security Material)
    def credentialName = "auth-code-demo"

    // Get an instance of SecureStoreService
    def secureStoreService = ITApiFactory.getApi(SecureStoreService.class, null)

    if (secureStoreService == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("SecureStoreService not available")
    }

    // Fetch the access token
    def tokenResponse = secureStoreService.getAccesTokenForOauth2AuthorizationCodeCredential(credentialName)

    if (tokenResponse == null) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Failed to retrieve access token for credential: ${credentialName}")
    }

    // Extract access token string
    def accessToken = tokenResponse.getAccessToken()

    // Optional: log for debug (mask in production!)
    //messageLogFactory.getMessageLog(message).addAttachmentAsString("OAuth2 Access Token", accessToken, "text/plain")

    // Store token in message header for downstream adapters
    message.setHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)

    return message
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;6.2.2.4 The third step in the sequence is to call the OData entity set through the &lt;EM&gt;intermediate&lt;/EM&gt; IFlow. Note that the authorization setting is explicitly configured as &lt;EM&gt;None&lt;/EM&gt;, since the bearer token is already applied in the preceding Groovy script step. Also, do note that the intermediate IFlow eventually calls the final IFlow, as we studied in step 4 of 6.2.1.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-07 at 5.00.36 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/310708i8E961EE95568703B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-07 at 5.00.36 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-07 at 5.00.36 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;6.2.2.5 The final step in the sequence is to log the response returned after the &lt;EM&gt;final&lt;/EM&gt; IFlow executes, which is handled by a simple Groovy script.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;6.2.2.6. After triggering the process, you can verify the outcome in the Message Processing Logs (MPL). You should see an entry in the &lt;EM&gt;Completed&lt;/EM&gt; state, with the Attachments section containing a text representation of the backend response.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":trophy:"&gt;🏆&lt;/span&gt;Congratulations on reaching this stage!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-05 at 4.50.04 PM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/310762i0E817501ECDD4AA1/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-05 at 4.50.04 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-05 at 4.50.04 PM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1831118391"&gt;Closing summary:&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we explored how OAuth2 SAML Bearer assertion support in SAP Cloud Integration serves as a powerful mechanism for securing IFlows and APIs. By leveraging trust configurations, user propagation, and the integration of identity providers, we demonstrated how this grant type enables secure end-to-end flows while maintaining user context. Along the way, we also highlighted related patterns—such as the use of Authorization Code grant type in specific scenarios—and showed how these capabilities extend the flexibility of SAP Integration Suite when working with corporate identity providers and SAP Cloud Identity Services.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As integration landscapes continue to evolve, adopting OAuth2 SAML Bearer assertion not only strengthens security but also ensures compliance with modern identity federation standards. With the concepts and examples covered here, you now have a foundation to design flows that are both secure and user-aware—critical ingredients for enterprise-grade integrations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>
