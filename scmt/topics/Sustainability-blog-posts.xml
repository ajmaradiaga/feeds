    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1759972426"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Building Sustainable Supply Chains: From Design to Reuse&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sustainability is no longer just a nice-to-have; it’s a business must. Customers, regulators, and investors expect companies to take responsibility not only for their own operations but also for the environmental and social impact across their entire supply chain. That’s where the concept of &lt;EM&gt;double materiality&lt;/EM&gt; comes in: it examines both how sustainability risks and opportunities affect a company's financial performance and how its activities impact society and the environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The challenge? Supply chains are sprawling, multi-tiered networks that cross industries, continents, and regulatory systems. But within this complexity lies opportunity. With the right strategy, processes, and technology, companies can build supply chains that are not only resilient and compliant but also drivers of long-term value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, we’ll explore how organizations can move step by step—from design to reuse—towards building truly sustainable supply chains, and we’ll highlight some of the SAP solutions that make this transformation possible.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1692541640"&gt;Why Sustainable Supply Chains Matter&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supply chains are at the heart of the sustainability challenge. In industries such as automotive, consumer goods, and manufacturing, they can account for the majority of a company’s carbon footprint. Scope 3 emissions, encompassing those from suppliers, logistics, and product use, can account for more than 70% of a company's total greenhouse gas (GHG) impact.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And carbon is just one piece of the puzzle. Companies must also navigate regulatory requirements, such as EUDR and CBAM, improve resource efficiency, reduce waste, and prepare for climate-related risks, including water shortages and flooding. It sounds daunting, but within this complexity lies a real opportunity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Think of the supply chain as a circle rather than a straight line:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Design sets the stage. Choices about materials, packaging, and product life cycles determine environmental impact long before anything is produced.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Plan and Procure shape how responsibly resources are sourced and how suppliers are engaged in meeting sustainability goals.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manufacture is about efficiency and using less energy and water, generating less waste, and embedding circular practices into production.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Delivery focuses on logistics: reducing emissions in transportation, optimizing routes, and rethinking packaging.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The product usage shifts the spotlight to the customer, where durability, repairability, and energy efficiency influence both sustainability and satisfaction.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reuse closes the loop through recycling, remanufacturing, or creating entirely new business models around product-as-a-service.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="CButzlaff_1-1757700127083.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313664i75A6EA81264B77AE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="CButzlaff_1-1757700127083.png" alt="CButzlaff_1-1757700127083.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This circular approach transforms sustainability from a compliance exercise into a growth engine. Companies that weave sustainability into every step of their supply chain can cut costs, win customer trust, unlock new markets, and build resilience against disruptions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1496028135"&gt;Smart Design, Lower Impact&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Take the example of a car seat. Sustainability starts in the design phase: the choice of materials, say eco-friendly upholstery instead of leather, has an immediate impact on the product’s footprint. In fact, leather use can trigger regulatory requirements in certain markets, such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) compliance in Europe. Beyond materials, the way the seat is designed also matters. A seat that’s easy to disassemble makes it simpler to recycle components or reuse some material later, extending its lifecycle.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where technology comes in. &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Responsible+Design+and+Production/pd-p/73555000100800003214" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1223-1"&gt;SAP Responsible Design and Production&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;helps manufacturers anticipate future Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) fees, giving them the insight to make smarter design and packaging decisions upfront. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Green+Token/pd-p/73555000100800004161" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1225-1"&gt;SAP Green Token&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;offers chain-of-custody transparency for certified sustainable and recycled materials, providing the credibility companies need to back sustainability claims, including compliance with regulations like EUDR.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In addition, with &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Product+and+REACH+Compliance/pd-p/c317261d-e3f4-4add-a2e0-d6cdcda9df21" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="226-1"&gt;SAP Product and REACH Compliance&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;manufacturers can assess and document the environmental compatibility and regional marketability of their products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1299514630"&gt;From Cost to Carbon: Why Supply Chain Planning Needs a Sustainability Upgrade&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Supply chain planning has traditionally focused on three things: cost, availability, and quality. But today, there’s a new non-negotiable: sustainability. Take the former example of a car seat: if the design calls for leather, then in Europe that leather must be EUDR-certified. Certifications like this shouldn’t be seen as an afterthought; they need to carry the same weight in planning as cost or quality.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And it goes beyond compliance. In the past, planners compared scenarios to find the best margins or service levels. Now, the question is just as much about impact: &lt;EM&gt;Which scenario delivers the lowest carbon footprint?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Smarter planning naturally leads to less waste. Optimizing inventory and capacity not only improves efficiency and saves money, but it also reduces emissions, creating better outcomes for both the business and the planet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For global manufacturers, this matters even more. Europe requires EUDR-certified leather, while other markets may not. By weaving sustainability into planning, companies can stay compliant in every region without sacrificing efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is where solutions like &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Integrated+Business+Planning/pd-p/67838200100800006742" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="664-1"&gt;SAP Integrated Business Planning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(IBP) make a difference. IBP allows companies to embed sustainability into every step in the process, treating certifications as sustainability attributes, simulating emissions across scenarios, and flagging ESG risks before they escalate.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The bottom line: Future-proof supply chains don’t just balance cost and service; they balance cost, service, compliance, and environmental impact.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1103001125"&gt;Procurement as a Catalyst for Sustainability&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Procurement isn’t just about negotiating the best price or ensuring materials arrive on time; it's also about managing risk and optimizing supply chain efficiency. Every buying decision has a ripple effect on a company’s sustainability footprint, making procurement one of the most powerful levers for driving meaningful change.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Suppliers are validated based on their overall risk profile. This does include their exposure to climate change-related risks, their mitigation strategies, certifications, and overall sustainability performance. In our example of EUDR-certified leather, it is about the validation that the leather has not been produced by farms with deforestation practices. In addition, suppliers are requested to share the carbon footprint of their products, the calculation method, and potentially assurance documents. The capability of exchanging sustainability data, such as scope 3 emission data, across the value chain becomes crucial for collaboration to hit greenhouse targets. Analyzing the carbon footprint of different material choices allows companies to make informed sourcing decisions and balance cost, quality, and sustainability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP offers multiple solutions to help customers. Embedding sustainability attributes into the risk assessment using&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Ariba+Supplier+Risk/pd-p/73554900100700001196" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1180-1"&gt;SAP Ariba Supplier Risk&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;helps to manage climate-related risks. Using &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Sustainability+Data+Exchange/pd-p/73555000100800004181" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1229-1"&gt;SAP Sustainability Data Exchange&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;supports a standardized and certified way to exchange sustainability data, &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Sustainability+Footprint+Management/pd-p/73554900100800003441" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1224-1"&gt;SAP Sustainability Footprint Management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;calculates and analyzes emissions tied to product purchases, transportation, and manufacturing, and finally,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Green+Token/pd-p/73555000100800004161" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1225-2"&gt;SAP Green Token&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;helps companies to be compliant with EUDR regulations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When procurement leaders embrace these tools and practices, they move from simply buying materials to actively driving decarbonization and ensuring compliance. Sustainable buying isn’t a “nice to have” anymore; it’s a game-changer for business and the planet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-906487620"&gt;Beyond Compliance: Embedding Sustainability Into Manufacturing Operations&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once raw materials arrive at the factory floor, the responsibility shifts from sourcing to production. At this stage, manufacturers face a critical challenge: how to minimize energy use, conserve water, cut waste, ensure worker safety, and stay compliant with evolving regulations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sustainable manufacturing isn’t just about checking boxes; it’s about embedding smarter processes that strengthen resilience and competitiveness. Here’s how leading companies are approaching it:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Energy and emissions tracking: By modeling energy flows across production lines, manufacturers can allocate emissions directly to activities and products, providing the transparency required to develop and track decarbonization strategies.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Waste reduction: Cradle-to-grave waste management and recycling programs help eliminate inefficiencies and reduce environmental impact.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Worker health and safety: Predictive tools highlight potential hazards, while real-time tracking improves visibility into incidents and ensures safer working conditions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Take upholstery manufacturing as an example. By modeling the energy flow of a production line, businesses can calculate the carbon footprint of each unit produced. This not only enables accurate product-level sustainability reporting but also highlights where efficiency gains can be made.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To enable this shift, technology plays a vital role. SAP solutions help manufacturers close the loop:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;#SAP Environment Management&amp;nbsp;monitors emissions, waste, and compliance across operations&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;#SAP Workplace Safety strengthens incident visibility and fosters a culture of safety&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Sustainability+Footprint+Management/pd-p/73554900100800003441" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1224-2"&gt;SAP Sustainability Footprint Management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; calculates product footprints based on measured data for transparent reporting&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;When done right, sustainable manufacturing reduces risk, ensures compliance, and delivers products with smaller footprints, turning sustainability into a competitive advantage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-709974115"&gt;Sustainable Logistics: Reducing Emissions Beyond the Factory Gate&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once a product leaves the factory, its journey has only just begun. Trucks, ships, and planes carry it across regions and continents, but these movements come at a cost. The logistics and distribution phase is one of the biggest contributors to supply chain emissions. The good news? Smarter delivery models are proving that it’s possible to move goods efficiently while shrinking environmental impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It starts with transportation optimization. By consolidating shipments, reducing empty miles, and adopting low-carbon fuels, companies can cut unnecessary emissions while saving costs.&amp;nbsp; Just as important is knowing how much carbon is being released. By tracking emissions from different types of transport and sharing that information with customers, companies can be more transparent, helping customers to make better, more eco-friendly decisions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Collaboration plays a powerful role, too. By sharing carbon footprint data with customers and partners, manufacturers can build trust and enable joint action. For example, the automotive supplier calculates the full carbon footprint of the car seats from the material used, the inbound transport of those materials, through manufacturing energy use, to outbound delivery. The results are shared with OEM partners via Catena-X, creating a shared foundation for decarbonization across the value chain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Technology is what makes these advances scalable:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Transportation+Management/pd-p/01200615320800000686" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="879-1"&gt;SAP Transportation Management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;optimizes routing and freight networks, reducing both emissions and costs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Sustainability+Footprint+Management/pd-p/73554900100800003441" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1224-3"&gt;SAP Sustainability Footprint Management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;calculates carbon emissions, including scope 3.1 as well as logistics-based emissions such as scope 3.4 and 3.9 categories.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Sustainability+Data+Exchange/pd-p/73555000100800004181" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1229-2"&gt;SAP Sustainability Data Exchange&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;enables transparent and secure sharing of carbon data across networks&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;By embedding sustainability into logistics, companies can reduce costs, meet rising customer expectations, and support Scope 3 reporting, all while ensuring their products reach the right place at the right time with a lighter footprint.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-513460610"&gt;Closing the Loop: How Circular Supply Chains Create New Value&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The final stage of a product’s life cycle isn’t really the end; it’s the beginning of a new cycle. That’s the power of circular supply chains: they extend product life, recover valuable resources, and dramatically cut waste. It starts with managing and auditing waste streams responsibly, making sure even hazardous materials are handled the right way. From there, recycled inputs can be looped back into production, reducing the need for virgin resources and shrinking the footprint of every product made. Partnerships with recyclers and waste handlers play a big role too, creating steady, sustainable flows of materials that companies can depend on. But one of the most powerful strategies is remanufacturing and reuse. By reusing components and remanufacturing products closer to home, companies recover higher value while cutting both costs and emissions tied to sourcing and logistics. This approach strengthens ties with suppliers and gives both providers and customers a chance to reduce waste and build more sustainable products together. In our example, car seat fabrics might not just be made from recycled plastics supplied by disposal companies, but also combined with cork-based materials to meet demand, lowering reliance on new resources while delivering products that customers want. SAP helps bring these strategies to life.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Environment%25252C+Health%25252C+and+Safety+Management/pd-p/01200615320800000062" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="577-1"&gt;SAP Environment, Health, and Safety Management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;ensures compliance and auditing of waste streams, &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Integrated+Business+Planning/pd-p/67838200100800006742" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="664-2"&gt;SAP Integrated Business Planning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;balances demand and supply for recycled inputs, and &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Waste+and+Recycling/pd-p/01200615320800000611" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="890-1"&gt;SAP Waste and Recycling&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;makes it easier to collaborate with recyclers and waste handlers. The impact speaks for itself: car seat manufacturers, adopting circular supply chain practices, have cut carbon emissions by 52% through smarter routing and sustainable materials, reduced per-seat emissions by 34%, and made emissions reporting 75 times faster. Circular supply chains don’t just close the loop; they create new opportunities for efficiency, savings, and competitive advantage. The final stage is not the end but the beginning of a new cycle. Circular supply chains extend product life, recover resources, and reduce waste.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-316947105"&gt;Conclusion: The Future of Supply Chains Is Sustainable, Digital, and Circular&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;Sustainable supply chains are no longer a niche initiative. They are central to regulatory compliance, market differentiation, and long-term resilience. By embedding sustainability from design to reuse, organizations can cut carbon emissions and waste, ensure compliance with global regulations, build stronger supplier and customer relationships, and unlock entirely new circular business models. Technology is the enabler. With SAP's&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/Sustainability/pd-p/140502597117949649788634441139048" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1145-1"&gt;Sustainability&lt;/a&gt;solutions,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;companies can move beyond fragmented initiatives to an integrated, data-driven approach that turns sustainability into a growth engine.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;As Can Üstünberk, Executive Board Member at MarturFompak International, puts it: “&lt;EM&gt;We are working passionately to adapt emerging technologies to all of our business processes and to create a ‘New Digital and Sustainable’ business model—to make it more resilient, more competitive, and above all to create a more Sustainable World.&lt;/EM&gt;”&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;The future of supply chains is sustainable, digital, and circular. The companies that act decisively today will be the leaders of tomorrow.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;This blog has explored how organizations can transform their supply chains step by step, from design to reuse, and how SAP solutions can make that transformation a reality.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</content>

Introduction: SAP EHS in the Public Cloud&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) helps organizations establish and maintain safe, sustainable, and compliant operations. The SAP EHS Public Cloud solution provides an integrated platform to manage environmental, occupational health, and safety processes more efficiently and transparently.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1371622690"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.1 Objective &amp;amp; Approach&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the growing relevance of SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) in the Public Cloud, the objective of this blog series is to support the SAP Community by sharing our practical insights, lessons learned, and best practices from real project experience at Deloitte. We aim to provide a hands-on, experience-based guide that highlights both opportunities and key considerations for integrating SAP EHS Public Cloud into existing system landscapes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We have implemented and extended SAP EHS Public Cloud across multiple customer environments. Based on this experience, we outline a step-by-step approach to help organizations successfully set up and integrate SAP EHS Public Cloud side-by-side with existing SAP solutions such as SAP S/4HANA On-Premise, SAP Master Data Governance (MDG), and SAP SuccessFactors.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This guidebook forms the foundation for the blog series. It demonstrates the architecture and approach we used in our internal proof-of-concept setup together with SAP, where we tested core EHS use cases – Incident Management, Risk Management, and Emissions Management – in a hybrid system landscape. Each part of the series focuses on one integration area, including practical implementation steps, lessons learned, and recommendations for EHS practitioners, architects, and sustainability professionals.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1175109185"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.2 What can you expect from this Blog Series?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This blog series provides a structured, step-by-step guide on how to integrate SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) Public Cloud side-by-side with existing SAP landscapes. Each article focuses on one key integration scenario, combining technical setup with practical, real-life application examples.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You will gain:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hands-on integration guidance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Architectural best practices&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Real-world lessons learned from project experience&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;End-to-end scenarios across the most relevant EHS use cases&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-978595680"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.3 Why SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) Matters?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sustainability, regulatory compliance, and employee well-being have become key drivers for long-term business success. At the same time, organizations face increasing challenges from business disruptions caused by regulatory changes, workplace incidents, and a continuously changing environment – requiring them to constantly adapt and adjust their operations. SAP EHS ensures that companies not only meet legal requirements but also foster a culture of responsibility and care. A well-implemented EHS strategy helps minimize risks, reduce incidents, and protect both people and the environment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For a detailed overview of SAP EHS capabilities and features, we recommend exploring the official SAP documentation and Learning Journey (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/outlining-environment-health-and-safety-overview" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-782082175"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.4 Why SAP EHS in the Public Cloud?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Transitioning SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) to the SAP Public Cloud provides organizations with a modern and continuously evolving platform to manage sustainability, compliance, and safety processes more efficiently. With frequent feature and regulatory updates delivered by SAP, companies benefit from the latest innovations without the need for complex upgrades or custom maintenance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A key advantage of SAP EHS in the Public Cloud is its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing SAP system landscapes. Organizations can extend their current on-premise or private cloud environments without disruption, connecting SAP EHS Public Cloud side-by-side with core ERP solutions such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP Master Data Governance (MDG), or SAP SuccessFactors. This ensures consistent data flows, unified reporting, and a holistic view of environmental, health, and safety performance across the enterprise.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;From a business perspective, SAP EHS in the Public Cloud accelerates implementation, reduces total cost of ownership, and supports standardized processes and global compliance frameworks. At the same time, it offers the flexibility needed to adapt to evolving local regulations and sustainability requirements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) supports a wide range of processes that help organizations manage safety, health, and environmental requirements in an integrated and efficient way. Leveraging the Public Cloud, companies can standardize processes, ensure continuous compliance, and gain transparency across locations. The core capabilities range from incident reporting and risk assessment to chemical and emissions management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="EHS Solutions &amp;amp; Key Capabilities" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338132iA45E56D76E7A98AA/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1762793066866.png" alt="EHS Solutions &amp;amp; Key Capabilities" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;EHS Solutions &amp;amp; Key Capabilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-456485951"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-259972446"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Integrating SAP EHS Public Cloud Side-by-Side (Guidebook)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Now that we have introduced SAP EHS and its value in the Public Cloud, this chapter explains how SAP EHS Public Cloud can be integrated into an existing enterprise system landscape side-by-side.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This section provides a practical guide on how to extend current on-premise or hybrid EHS capabilities with SAP Public Cloud innovations – without disrupting existing business processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We outline the system setup, architectural approach, and key technical prerequisites required for a successful implementation. The guide is based on our internal proof-of-concept, developed together with SAP and validated across three core EHS use cases.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By following this approach, organizations can understand how to seamlessly connect SAP EHS Public Cloud with their existing SAP solutions and build a scalable, future-ready, and compliant EHS environment.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-192541660"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.1 Scope&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this guidebook, we focus on three core use cases that represent the most common and business-relevant EHS scenarios for our clients, making it ideal to demonstrate the side-by-side integration approach:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Incident Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Risk Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Emissions Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For detailed feature descriptions and configuration guidance, please refer to the official SAP EHS documentation and Learning Journey (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/outlining-environment-health-and-safety-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By concentrating on these use cases, we provide a clear overview of how SAP EHS Public Cloud can be integrated with an existing SAP landscape. Each scenario highlights key integration touchpoints, master data synchronization, and cross-process reporting requirements – without adding unnecessary complexity.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To illustrate these use cases in a practical and relatable way, we will refer to a fictional company, Mike Machineries, throughout this guidebook. This example helps demonstrate process flows, integration touchpoints, and system interactions in a realistic business context.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fictional Organization: Mike Machineries&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Fictional Organization - Mike Machineries" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338133i3E1007F9BCD3885F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1762793588729.png" alt="Fictional Organization - Mike Machineries" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Fictional Organization - Mike Machineries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Mike Machineries is a growing producer of high-quality coffee machines, headquarted in the United States with expanding operations in Europe.

With SAP EHS in the Public Cloud, incident data becomes centrally, accessible, improving transparency, responsiveness, and cross-site collaboration (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/outlining-incident-management-1_ef89ce80-8b17-45af-b56a-6dbdba4495bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Incident Management - Business Process" style="width: 943px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338134iA57D7C13EBD2581F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_1-1762793735517.png" alt="Incident Management - Business Process" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Incident Management - Business Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;User Scenario (A) - Incident Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;During a routine maintenance task at the Mike Machineries production facility in Hamburg, an internal maintenance technician slipped on spilled oil near a coffee machine assembly unit and suffered a minor injury. A nearby colleague witnessed the incident and immediately reported the event in SAP EHS Public Cloud via the Initial Incident Entry.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As the Incident involved a workplace injury, a First Aider on site recorded the medical details in an Injury/Illness Log Entry. Based on these entries, the system automatically created an Incident Report and notified the responsible Incident Manager, who reviewed the information and initiated the incident process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As part of the investigation, relevant statements were collected, the work environment was assessed, and supporting evidence such as photos and maintenance instructions was documented. The root cause analysis revealed that the injury occurred due to an oil spill caused by a minor leak at the test station and insufficient signage during maintenance activities.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Corrective and preventive actions were defined, including immediate cleaning and leak repair, improved floor marking around the test station, and reinforcing safety instructions for technicians handling maintenance tasks. Once the actions were completed and validated, the Incident Manager finalized the documentation and completed the required reporting in SAP EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--146634000"&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.1.2 Risk Management&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Risk Management is a key element of proactive safety and environmental protection. SAP EHS provides tools to identify potential hazards, assess their severity and likelihood, and define appropriate mitigation measures. Using structured risk matrices and standardized assessment logic, organizations can continuously evaluate and minimize risks across their operations, strengthening safety awareness and accountability (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/analyzing-health-and-safety-management-1_fd18fc84-89dc-418e-b29a-1234b7c7370c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Operational Risk Assessment - Business Process" style="width: 943px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338135i46FCD233FBB958C3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_2-1762793905491.png" alt="Operational Risk Assessment - Business Process" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Operational Risk Assessment - Business Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;User Scenario (B) - Risk Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At Mike Machineries production facility in Stuttgart, a new industrial cleaning solvent named “Precision Parts Cleaning Solvent X42” was introduced for maintaining high-precision coffee machine components. During a routine safety walk, a supervisor noticed a strong chemical vapors in the maintenance area and observed that technicians were not consistently using the required personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling the solvent. The hazard was reported in SAP EHS Public Cloud, including the supplier details and safety data sheet (SDS) for traceability.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The hazard was added to an existing Risk Assessment Project on “Chemical Handling and Storage Safety”. An Industrial Hygienist conducted the risk assessment, reviewing the solvent’s properties, exposure, risks, flammability, and current working conditions. Based on these factors, the inherent risk was classified as “high”, and several mitigation measures were defined including:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;improving ventilation in the chemical handling area,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;enforcing mandatory PPE usage for all employees handling the solvent,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;updating SDS documentation and conducting refresher training for technicians,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;implementing stricter storage and labelling requirements, and&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;arranging a follow-up with the supplier to explore safer substitute products.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A Control Inspection was performed to verify the implementation of the safety measures. Once completed, the residual risk was reduced to “medium-to-low” and considered acceptable. The risk assessment was formally closed in SAP EHS Public Cloud. Key learnings and updated chemical-handling procedures were shared across all Mike Machineries sites to strengthen preventive safety practices.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--343147505"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.1.3 Emissions Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With Emissions Management, SAP EHS provides a comprehensive solution to record, calculate, and monitor environmental impacts such as air emissions, wastewater, or waste generation. Companies can track key environmental indicators, meet regulatory reporting requirements, and ensure ESG compliance with confidence. By integrating production and logistics data, emissions reporting becomes more accurate, consistent, and audit-ready (&lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/discover-the-environment-health-safety-modules-in-sap-s-4hana/outlining-environment-management-1_c6c8d05d-66fd-4149-a580-6532b447ba0a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;read more&lt;/A&gt;).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Process&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Emissions Management - Business Process" style="width: 943px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338136i4818121F3210AD88/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_3-1762794018117.png" alt="Emissions Management - Business Process" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Emissions Management - Business Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;User Scenario (C) - Emissions Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At the Mike Machineries production facility in Dublin, the Environmental Manager is responsible for ensuring compliance with local air emission regulations. One of the main emission sources on site is a gas-fired roasting unit used to treat metal components before assembly. The unit operates at a designated Functional Location and requires regular monitoring of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. To ensure compliance, the Environmental Manager prepared the annual emissions monitoring plan, including sampling intervals, measurement methods, and required documentation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An Environmental Technician carried out the data collection, sampling exhaust gases from the roasting unit and recording gas consumption and operating hours. The supplier-provided material data was included to support emission factor calculations. The Environmental Manager then calculated and aggregated the emissions data in SAP EHS Public Cloud. During data monitoring, a deviation was identified: the recorded NOx emissions exceeded the permitted limit for the quarter.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An investigation was initiated to determine the cause of the deviation, revealing that a burner component had degraded over time, reducing combustion efficiency. A Corrective Action Plan was defined, including:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;replacing the defective burner component&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;requesting additional guidance from the supplier regarding optimal combustion settings,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;training operating staff to monitor early signs of inefficient combustion, and&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;updating maintenance schedules for more frequent inspections.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once the actions were completed and verified, a follow-up measurement confirmed that emissions had returned to compliant levels. The case was formally closed in SAP EHS Public Cloud.

A well-designed setup ensures seamless data exchange, process consistency, and scalable integration that supports both cloud innovation and existing on-premise operations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--932688020"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.2.1 Current State&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These environments often run mature EHS capabilities such as incident tracking, risk assessments, and compliance reporting. As companies move toward more agile and innovation-driven operating models, many are now exploring hybrid landscapes that combine existing on-premise EHS processes with SAP EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This approach allows organizations to retain existing configurations and data while gradually adopting modern cloud capabilities – without disrupting operations. It provides a flexible transition path towards a scalable and future-ready EHS solution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To simulate this real-world scenario, we have built an integrated demo landscape that reflects a typical enterprise setup and supports the side-by-side integration of SAP EHS Public Cloud. The landscape includes the following key components:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Overview System Landscape" style="width: 542px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338137i467C4810EA40DCF1/image-dimensions/542x264/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="542" height="264" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_4-1762794461953.png" alt="Overview System Landscape" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Overview System Landscape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is the core platform for SAP EHS. It provides standardized and continuously updated EHS capabilities for incident management, risk assessments, and emissions tracking – without the need for technical upgrades.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise remains the established backbone for many customers with existing ERP modules and processes. Integrating EHS Public Cloud side-by-side allows organizations to keep their current setup while gradually adopting cloud innovations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Master Data Governance (MDG)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP MDG ensures consistent, high-quality master data across the landscape. For EHS, MDG plays a key role in harmonizing Business Partner and Material data to support accurate reporting, risk assessments, and compliance processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP SuccessFactors&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP SuccessFactors provides the HR foundation for EHS. By integrating SuccessFactors with EHS Public Cloud, organizations can leverage employee and organizational data for incident reporting, safety roles, and occupational health-related processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) / SAP Integration Suite&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) provides the foundation for integration and extension in a side-by-side EHS scenario. Within BTP, the SAP Integration Suite enables secure data exchange between SAP EHS Public Cloud and existing SAP systems such as SAP S/4HANA On-Premise, SAP MDG, and SAP SuccessFactors. This setup ensures smooth interoperability in hybrid landscapes, supports process automation, and allows innovations through extensions and APIs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1129201525"&gt;2.2.2 Architectural Approach&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our demo landscape follows a side-by-side integration model that connects SAP EHS Public Cloud with existing SAP systems through&lt;/SPAN&gt; the SAP Integration Suite within the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). &lt;SPAN&gt;This architecture enables end-to-end EHS processes across cloud and on-premise environments, covering Incident Management, Risk Management, and Emissions Management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Architectural Approach" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338138iFAC9913C2059A15D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_5-1762794552191.png" alt="Architectural Approach" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Architectural Approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this setup, SAP EHS Public Cloud acts as the central application layer where the core EHS processes are executed. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Employee data is retrieved from SAP SuccessFactors through standard integration scenarios via SAP Integration Suite / Cloud Platform Integration (CPI), ensuring alignment of roles, responsibilities, and reporting hierarchies with SAP EHS Public Cloud. This supports consistent approval flows and clear accountability in EHS processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Foundational master data such as Business Partner and Material Master is governed in SAP Master Data Governance (MDG) and replicated to SAP EHS Public Cloud to ensure consistency of key business information across the landscape. For the MDG integration, organizations can use either IDoc or Web Service interfaces:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;IDoc-based integration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; is typically used for older SAP release versions or existing, established integration landscapes (generally prior to the SAP S/4HANA 2020 FPS02 release).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Web Service-based integration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; is considered best practice for more recent releases, offering a more flexible, scalable, and service-oriented data exchange approach (SAP S/4HANA 2020 FPS02 and onwards).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If additional mapping, transformation, or orchestration of API data is required, companies may optionally introduce the SAP Integration Suite / CPI as middleware. In our demo landscape, we implemented a direct Web Service integration between SAP MDG and SAP EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Technical objects, including Functional Location and Equipment, originate from SAP S/4HANA On-Premise (Plant Maintenance) and are integrated into the cloud using a customized iFlow via SAP Integration Suite / CPI as there is currently now standard interface available. This allows customers to reuse existing maintenance structures and align technical object data with EHS processes in the Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Overall, this side-by-side setup reflects a realistic enterprise architecture and demonstrates how SAP EHS Public Cloud can be embedded into an existing SAP system landscape without disruption – enabling scalability, transparency, and continuous innovation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1032312023"&gt;2.3 Prerequisites&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before integrating SAP EHS Public Cloud side-by-side with an existing SAP landscape, a number of technical and organizational prerequisites should be in place to ensure a smooth setup, secure connectivity, and reliable end-to-end process execution.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1522228535"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.3.1 Technical Prerequisites&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The following components are required to enable a stable and secure integration setup:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) as the central foundation for integration and extension, providing services such as API Management, Event Mesh for even-driven communication, and hosting the SAP Integration Suite.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Integration Suite – Cloud Platform Integration (CPI) subscription and configuration to support exchange between SAP S/4HANA On-Premise, SAP EHS Public Cloud, SAP MDG, and SAP SuccessFactors.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;SAP S/4HANA for product compliance is designed to empower businesses with capabilities that simplify compliance management. We will explore its key features, such as Compliance Data Foundation, Product Marketability, Safety Data Sheet Management, and Dangerous Goods Management. These functionalities not only ensure adherence to regulations but also integrate seamlessly with business operations, providing a comprehensive view of compliance across the product lifecycle. By leveraging these tools, companies can mitigate risks, reduce compliance costs, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 081153.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/340430i5528A54DE48BDEE8/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-11-14 081153.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 081153.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Highlights:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The course is open to everyone&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The course is free&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Understand how product compliance integrates into many different business roles&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Understand key aspects of the 3 core solution areas (Product Marketability, Dangerous Goods, Safety Data Sheets)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 083005.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/340432i5591D9E5088E453E/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-11-14 083005.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-14 083005.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For professionals seeking to advance their careers, expertise in product compliance is increasingly valuable. As companies expand globally, they require skilled individuals who can navigate the intricate web of international regulations and standards. This expertise can open doors to roles in regulatory affairs, quality assurance, and corporate strategy, among others. Additionally, with the advent of digital tools and platforms like SAP S/4HANA, professionals can leverage technology to enhance compliance processes, making them more efficient and integrated. By learning about product compliance, professionals not only safeguard their organizations but also position themselves as indispensable assets in the global marketplace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is a link to the &lt;A href="https://learning.sap.com/preview/learning-journeys/introducing-sap-s-4hana-for-product-compliance" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;learning journey&lt;/A&gt; and coming soon is the next part of the product compliance learning journey, a specific learning on dangerous goods.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Why is this Integration required?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integrating employee data from SAP SuccessFactors into SAP EHS Public Cloud is a foundational step for enabling core EHS processes such as Incident Management, Risk Management, and Emissions Management. Instead of maintaining employee data locally within SAP EHS&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Public Cloud, the system relies on Workforce Person master data replicated from the corporate HR system. This ensures that roles, organizational assignments, and reporting lines remain consistent across the enterprise.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accurate and up-to-date employee data is essential in Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS), as many process steps are people-driven – including incident reporting, assigning investigation responsibilities, approvals, and regulatory documentation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. Moreover, EHS integrated workflow functionalities are heavily based on a role and responsibility concept, which depends on the correct assignment of persons within the organization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In other words: Without employee integration, SAP EHS Public Cloud cannot correctly identify, assign, or document the people involved in an incident or are responsible for EHS tasks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Architectural Approach - Scope" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339596iE175589DFE7E1D25/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1762959449788.png" alt="Architectural Approach - Scope" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Architectural Approach - Scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The highlighted section of the architectural diagram illustrates the scope relevant to this blog post - focusing on the integration of employees from SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central (EC) into SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: While this post focuses on the standard integration scenario using SAP SuccessFactors EC as the source, employee master data can also be replicated from other connected HR systems or SAP S/4HANA On-Premise / Private Cloud environments.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; In such cases, a customized integration flow can be implemented in SAP Integration Suite to transfer the workforce data into SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. If the integration to the relevant HR system already exists, this step can be skipped. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reference to User Scenario (A) – Incident Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-members/sap-ehs-public-cloud-extending-your-existing-landscape-side-by-side-a/ba-p/14264551" target="_self"&gt;part 1 "Introduction &amp;amp;

When implementing Incident Management as shown here in the user scenario, please ensure that scope item &lt;STRONG&gt;3FP – Incident Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; is activated in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud via Central Business Configuration (CBC) beforehand. This activation is required to enable the Incident Management processes and related configuration in SAP EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;While this integration is a prerequisite for Incident Management, it is equally relevant across other EHS use cases such as Risk Management or Emissions Management. In these scenarios, consistent employee master data provides the foundation for assigning roles and responsibilities, managing organizational structures, and ensuring accurate process execution and compliance. Therefore, in the following section, we will take a closer look at the general setup of the employee data integration between SAP SuccessFactors and SAP EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1439116747"&gt;2. Prerequisites&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;To successfully set up the integration scenario for SAP EHS Public Cloud, several prerequisites must be met.

In our setup, SAP SuccessFactors was already fully implemented and configured, and our focus was primarily on enabling the integration with SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. Nevertheless, we have summarized the key configuration steps below to outline the main areas that typically need to be in place to support the JB1 replication scenario. For a detailed, step-by-step configuration, the official SAP Best Practice documentation can be referenced (&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/SolS/EARL_SolS-013/2508/SolP/JB1?region=DE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;JB1 setup instructions&lt;/A&gt; – chapter 3).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Provisioning Settings in EC&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The configuration begins in SuccessFactors Provisioning, where core system settings must be enabled to support employee data replication. This includes activating EC core features, ensuring required language packs are available, and enabling the necessary integration add-ons and OData APIs. These provisioning settings form the technical foundation that allows EC to supply employee data to external systems, including SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Push Replication Setup (Optional but Recommended)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Employee data can be transferred to SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud either through scheduled replication jobs or by using push replication. Push replication enables near-real-time updates and is recommended for scenarios where timely employee data is needed, such as EHS processes. If enables, additional configuration is required to specify which employee changes trigger replication and to define the conditions under which data is pushed to SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Data Model Configuration (HRIS &amp;amp; MDF)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To ensure compatibility with SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, key elements of the EC data model should be validated and adjusted if necessary. This includes checking HRIS elements for correctness, making sure mandatory fields are maintained, and aligning field properties such as formatting, field length, and data type. MDF objects must also be reviewed for employee-related data elements so that required data can be successfully replicated. Aligning the data model upfront minimizes replication error and ensures that all data transferred to SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud meets the expected structure.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Company Structure and Cost Assignment Alignments&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Employee data must be linked to the correct organizational units to enable downstream processes in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, including EHS. It is important to ensure that Legal Entities, Business Units, Departments, and Cost Centers are correctly structured and assigned. In some cases, custom fields may be required to support additional mapping between EC and S/4HANA, depending on the company’s organizational structure. A clear alignment of this data ensures that employees appear in the correct organizational context after replication.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integration User and Authentication Setup&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;An integration user with appropriate permissions must be created to allow SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud to retrieve employee data through EC APIs. This includes assigning the required OData API permissions and confirming that the chosen authentication method – basic authentication or certificate-based authentication – is correctly configured. Basic authentication is typically sufficient for testing or demonstration purposes, while certificate-based authentication is recommended for productive environments.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Optional EC Application Settings&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In addition to the core configuration steps, EC provides optional settings that can enhance the quality of employee data replicated to SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. These include settings such as employee information, and contingent worker data. While not mandatory for the integration, these options can enrich the employee profile in the target system.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-978658951"&gt;3.2 SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Configuration&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In addition to setting up SAP SuccessFactors EC, the SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud must also be configured to receive employee master data via the SAP Integration Suite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For this purpose, a Communication Arrangement is required to enable secure data exchange between the systems. In this scenario, the predefined Communication Arrangement &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP_COM_0001 – Employee Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt; is used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Activating and configuring this Communication Arrangement enables the necessary inbound API services, allowing the SAP Integration Suite to push employee data into SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Setup illustration of Communication Arrangement SAP_COM_0001" style="width: 512px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339609i7A7193E5BE7E4DAA/image-dimensions/512x245/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="512" height="245" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1762961050018.png" alt="Setup illustration of Communication Arrangement SAP_COM_0001" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Setup illustration of Communication Arrangement SAP_COM_0001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As shown in the illustration above, the Communication Arrangement consists of two key components: an Inbound Communication User and a Communication System.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-911228165"&gt;3.2.1 Communication User&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this integration scenario, an Inbound Communication User was created in the SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud (e.g. user SF_S4HC).&lt;/SPAN&gt; This user was used for Basic Authentication in the Communication Arrangement, and its credentials were securely stored later in the Security Material of SAP Integration Suite to enable a safe connection between the systems.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To create the Inbound Communication User in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, log in to the Fiori Launchpad as an administrator and open the app “&lt;STRONG&gt;Maintain Communication Users&lt;/STRONG&gt;”.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Select &amp;quot;Maintain Communication User&amp;quot;" style="width: 953px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339611iD5035561B74646AC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_1-1762961195310.png" alt="Select &amp;quot;Maintain Communication User&amp;quot;" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Select "Maintain Communication User"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;If no suitable user exists, simply select “&lt;STRONG&gt;New&lt;/STRONG&gt;” to create one.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Select New Communication User" style="width: 953px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339612i064A37533F289B6C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_2-1762961264259.png" alt="Select New Communication User" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Select New Communication User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Username and password can be freely defined but must be entered later in the Security Material section of the SAP Integration Suite for authentication.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Illustration of our Communication User" style="width: 952px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339613iDDEBA5C47E7117E4/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_3-1762961369546.png" alt="Illustration of our Communication User" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Illustration of our Communication User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These steps align with chapter 5.2 “&lt;EM&gt;Integration Credentials Configuration&lt;/EM&gt;” in the &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/SolS/EARL_SolS-013/2508/SolP/JB1?region=DE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;JB1 setup instructions&lt;/A&gt; (pages 29–30).

However, for additional integrations – such as cost center replication or payroll posting etc. – further configuration might be required (For reference, see chapter 4.1.2 “&lt;EM&gt;Create Communication Systems&lt;/EM&gt;” in the &amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/SolS/EARL_SolS-013/2508/SolP/JB1?region=DE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;JB1 setup instructions&lt;/A&gt;, pages 30-31).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To create the Communication System, log in to the SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Fiori Launchpad as an administrator and open the “&lt;STRONG&gt;Communication Systems&lt;/STRONG&gt;” app.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Select &amp;quot;Communication Systems&amp;quot;" style="width: 949px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339614i26D37798881F7AB5/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_4-1762961500428.png" alt="Select &amp;quot;Communication Systems&amp;quot;" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Select "Communication Systems"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;If no suitable entry is available, create a new system by selecting “&lt;STRONG&gt;New&lt;/STRONG&gt;”.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Select New Communication System" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339617i3EFCEB5C94D5FA15/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_5-1762961563621.png" alt="Select New Communication System" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Select New Communication System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enter a &lt;STRONG&gt;System ID&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;System Name&lt;/STRONG&gt; referring to the Integration Suite tenant and proceed with the set up.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="System Setup" style="width: 429px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339619iD7AA15A62C4B1673/image-dimensions/429x172/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="429" height="172" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_6-1762961622293.png" alt="System Setup" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;System Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After creating the new Communication System entry, additional configuration details must be maintained – including &lt;STRONG&gt;General Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Data&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Log System ID&lt;/STRONG&gt;, &lt;STRONG&gt;Business System ID&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and the &lt;STRONG&gt;User for Inbound Communication&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

This ensures that all relevant employee master data from SAP SuccessFactors EC is replicated into SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud before any delta update occurs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Why this is important: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accurate and up-to-date employee master data is essential across all EHS use cases, as it ensures that roles, responsibilities, and organizational structures are consistently reflected in safety and compliance processes. This is particularly critical for Incident Management, where incidents must be linked to the correct employees and supervisors. Without a complete initial load, subsequent data updates cannot be processed reliably.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Actions:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. Set the Timer to Run Once:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In the iFlow configuration, choose &lt;STRONG&gt;Run Once&lt;/STRONG&gt; for the initial execution. This triggers a one-time full replication of all employee master data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="iFlow Settings for Timer" style="width: 939px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339684iD27ABF252BCC2DF4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_4-1762963551354.png" alt="iFlow Settings for Timer" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;iFlow Settings for Timer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; After the initial load is complete, switch the timer to &lt;STRONG&gt;Schedule to Recur&lt;/STRONG&gt; for delta replication.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Why is this needed? &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Because the initial load only runs once. If you leave the timer unchanged, no further updates will be replicated. By switching to a recurring schedule, you enable delta replication, which keeps employee data continuously up to date.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Configure Receivers:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Next, open the iFlow and click “&lt;STRONG&gt;Configure&lt;/STRONG&gt;”.

This step establishes the foundation for all ongoing delta updates and ensures that EHS processes consistently reference the correct workforce context.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(These steps correspond to chapter 5.4.1 “&lt;EM&gt;Configuring Employee Master Data Replication iFlow for Initial Full Load&lt;/EM&gt;” (pages 56–59) in the &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/SolS/EARL_SolS-013/2508/SolP/JB1?region=DE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;JB1 setup instructions&lt;/A&gt;.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configuring Employee Master Data Replication Integration Flow (iFlow) for Delta Replication:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After the initial full load has established the basic dataset in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, the next step is to enable delta replication. This ensures that any changes in SAP SuccessFactors, such as new hires, terminations, or updates to employee information, are continuously synchronized with S/4HANA Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Why this is important: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Delta replication plays a key role in keeping employee master data current across all EHS use cases. Accurate and timely workforce is essential not only for Incident Management, but also for other processes like Risk- or Emission-Management, where employee roles and organizational responsibilities drive compliance and reporting accuracy. Without a delta replication, the system would remain static after the initial load, leading to outdated information and potential inconsistencies. By enabling the delta replication, updates are processed incrementally, reducing system load and improving overall efficiency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Checks before Deployment:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To activate delta replication, ensure the following settings are applied (as mentioned in the initial load configuration):&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Timer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Set to &lt;STRONG&gt;Schedule to Recur&lt;/STRONG&gt; with an appropriate frequency (e.g., every 10 minutes between 00:00 and 24:00).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Parameter&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Set &lt;STRONG&gt;Initial_Full_Load = FALSE&lt;/STRONG&gt; to switch from full load to incremental updates.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;All other configuration steps remain the same as for the initial load.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Result:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Once deployed, the iFlow performs &lt;STRONG&gt;incremental updates&lt;/STRONG&gt; instead of a full replication, ensuring that SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud always reflects the latest employee master data for EHS and related business processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(These steps correspond to chapter 5.4.1&lt;STRONG&gt; “&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Configuring Employee Master Data Replication iFlow for Delta Replication&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;”&lt;/STRONG&gt; (pages 60 – 61) in the &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/SolS/EARL_SolS-013/2508/SolP/JB1?region=DE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;JB1 setup instructions&lt;/A&gt;.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--736111244"&gt;3.3.4 Reset Existing Delta Sync Configuration&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In exceptional situations, it may become necessary to reset the delta synchronization configuration. This option is designed to reinitialize the replication process by clearing the stored delta markers, allowing the system to fetch data as if it were the first replication cycle.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When is a reset relevant?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Correction of inconsistencies:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; If previous delta runs failed or resulted in incomplete updates, a reset ensures that all changes are captured.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Testing and validation:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; For scenarios where a fresh replication cycle is required without performing a complete system reset.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Troubleshooting:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; When resolving integration issues that cannot be addressed through standard delta processing.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By resetting the configuration, the system retrieves data from the earliest defined point, ensuring completeness. However, this approach should be applied with caution, as it can lead to significant data volumes being processed again.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How can the Reset be performed?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Open the SAP Cloud Integration Web UI of your SAP Cloud Integration tenant and choose “Monitor” (under Design) from the top-level menu on the left.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the “Manage Stores” block, choose the “Variables” tile. The available variables are displayed in the Global Data Store.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To reset a replication scenario, delete the corresponding variable(s) from this list by choosing the “Delete” button next to the variable(s). The delete button for each variable is on the right side of the variable table in column “Actions”. The table below specifies the variable name(s) of the variable(s) which needs(s) to be deleted to reset the delta sync configuration for the replication scenario / corresponding Integration Flow (iFlow).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(These steps correspond to chapter 5.5 “&lt;EM&gt;Reset Existing Delta Sync Configuration&lt;/EM&gt;” (pages 69 - 70) in the &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/SolS/EARL_SolS-013/2508/SolP/JB1?region=DE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;JB1 setup instructions&lt;/A&gt;.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--639221742"&gt;3.4 End-to-End Monitoring of Employee Master Data Replication&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Monitoring is a critical part of ensuring that employee data replication runs smoothly across all systems involved in the JB1 integration scenario. Accurate employee data is the foundation for all EHS processes, as many scenarios – such as incident tracking, risk assessments, and regulatory reporting – depend on reliable workforce information. Inaccurate or incomplete replication can disrupt these processes and impact compliance or operational efficiency.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1129138254"&gt;3.4.1 Monitoring Across Systems&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Employee Master Data Replication involves three layers:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud (Inbound Monitoring):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As described in chapter 3.2.4, inbound replication is monitored using the Message Dashboard (AIF Monitoring). This allows administrators to review message statuses and reprocess failed messages if required.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central (Source Monitoring):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In SAP SuccessFactors, replication activity can be monitored using the SFAPI Audit Log, which displays outbound replication calls and related processing information. While this functionality is available, it is not covered in detail here.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Integration Suite (Middleware Monitoring):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP Integration Suite ensures that data flows correctly between SAP SuccessFactors and SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. Monitoring focuses on the integration flow status, message processing, and error handling within the middle layer.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1325651759"&gt;3.4.2 Monitoring in SAP Integration Suite&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Integration Suite provides several tools to track and manage integrations flows:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Navigate to Manage Integration Content:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Navigate to &lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor &amp;gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Manage Integration Content&lt;/STRONG&gt; to verify that the Integration Flow (iFlow) for employee replication is deployed and running. The status &lt;STRONG&gt;Started&lt;/STRONG&gt; indicates that the flow is active.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Navigate to Manage Integration Content" style="width: 849px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339719i002270ED56669B49/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_8-1762964205985.png" alt="Navigate to Manage Integration Content" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Navigate to Manage Integration Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;2. Monitor Message Processing:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Under &lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor Message Processing&lt;/STRONG&gt;, you can view detailed logs for executed messages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Navigate to Monitor Message Processing" style="width: 815px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339721iE57D828A8E0FDF70/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_9-1762964266866.png" alt="Navigate to Monitor Message Processing" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Navigate to Monitor Message Processing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This view shows whether each message has been successfully processed or if any errors occurred.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Example of successfully completed Message Processing" style="width: 819px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339723iB9E33D150DBDCDD1/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_10-1762964314085.png" alt="Example of successfully completed Message Processing" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Example of successfully completed Message Processing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. Message Status Overview:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The Message Status Overview aggregates statistics across all processed messages, including completed, failed and retried executions. This provides a consolidated view of the integration scenario over a selected timeframe and supports quick identification of patterns or recurring issues.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Message Status Overview" style="width: 831px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339725i693FC028D233B33F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_11-1762964395687.png" alt="Message Status Overview" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Message Status Overview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;(These steps correspond to chapter 6 “&lt;EM&gt;Monitoring of Replication Scenarios&lt;/EM&gt;” (page 71) in the &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/SolS/EARL_SolS-013/2508/SolP/JB1?region=DE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;JB1 setup instructions&lt;/A&gt;.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--935359250"&gt;4. Lessons Learned&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Implementing JB1 for employee integration in SAP EHS Public Cloud provided several key insights that are even important for similar projects:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. Employee Integration is Mandatory:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accurate workforce data is the foundation for EHS processes. Without it, Incident Management cannot correctly identify the involved people, assign responsibilities, or ensure compliance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Initial Load is Critical:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A successful initial replication establishes the baseline for all subsequent updates. Any errors at this stage can lead to inconsistencies throughout the system.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3. Delta Replication ensures Timelines:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regular updates are essential to reflect organizational changes such as new hires or role adjustments. Without delta replication, the system remains static and operational risks increase.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4. Reset Delta Sync is a Fallback, not a Routine Step:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This option is useful for correcting inconsistencies or re-initializing data during testing. However, it should be applied cautiously due to the potential for large data volumes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5. Monitoring is Essential for Operational Reliability:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Continuous monitoring of replication flows prevents disruptions. Tools like AIF monitoring in SAP S/4HANA and Execution Manager in SuccessFactors proved invaluable for early error detection.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;6. Authentication Strategy Matters:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;While Basic Authentication is acceptable for demos or test environments, certificate-based authentication is strongly recommended for production to ensure security standards.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;7. Organizational Data Alignment is Key:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Mismatches between legal entities and company codes were identified as a common source of replication errors. Early validation avoids downstream issues.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;8. Demo vs. Production Considerations:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Simplifications used in demos (e.g., Basic Auth) needs to be adapted for production environments to ensure compliance and robustness.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;9. Optional Data Can Become a Blocker:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Missing or incorrect optional fields, such as bank details, can prevent successful replication. These fields should be validated early in the process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1131872755"&gt;5.

Why is this Integration required?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integrating Business Partner and Material master data from SAP Master Data Governance (MDG) into SAP EHS Public Cloud is a foundational step for enabling core EHS processes, particularly in Emissions Management. Instead of maintaining these master data objects locally within SAP EHS Public Cloud, the system relies on harmonized and validated Business Partner and Material data coming from the corporate master data governance layer. This ensures that supplier information, responsible persons, material properties, and classification attributes remain consistent across the enterprise.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accurate and up-to-date Business Partner and Material data is essential in Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS), as many analytical and reporting steps in Emissions Management depend on correctly maintained master data. Examples include assigning responsible Environmental Managers, linking sampling activities to suppliers or contractors, and using material-specific characteristics (e.g., heating values, emission factors, composition) as inputs for emission calculations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In other words: Without integrated Business Partner and Material data, SAP EHS Public Cloud cannot reliably calculate emissions, assign responsibilities, or produce compliant environmental reports.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Architectural Approach - Scope" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342153i60E1D463436E7865/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1763459135792.png" alt="Architectural Approach - Scope" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Architectural Approach - Scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The highlighted section of the architectural diagram illustrates the scope relevant to this blog post - focusing on the integration of Business Partner and Material from SAP Master Data Governance (MDG) into SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reference to User Scenario (C) – Emissions Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-members/sap-ehs-public-cloud-extending-your-existing-landscape-side-by-side-a/ba-p/14264551" target="_self"&gt;part 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-members/sap-ehs-public-cloud-extending-your-existing-landscape-side-by-side-a/ba-p/14264551" target="_self"&gt;“Introduction &amp;amp;

The SAP SuccessFactors integration delivers Workforce Persons, which are used for people-related EHS processes (e.g., workflows, incident reporting, assignments). Emissions Management, however, requires full Business Partner master data – including organizational roles, supplier relationships, and external parties – that SAP SuccessFactors does not provide. These Business Partners are essential for material classification, supplier-dependent emission factors, regulatory reporting, and responsibilities that are not limited to internal employees.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This makes the integration of Business Partner and Material master from SAP MDG into SAP EHS Public Cloud a mandatory prerequisite for configuring Emissions Management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: When implementing Emissions Management as shown in the User Scenario, ensure that the relevant scope item – &lt;STRONG&gt;4XD – Emissions Management &lt;/STRONG&gt;– is activated in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud via Central Business Configuration (CBC). This activation enables the Emissions Management processes and configuration in SAP EHS Public Cloud so that the replicated Business Partner and Material master data can be used for monitoring, calculating, and reporting emissions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;While this integration is mandatory for Emissions Management, it is equally relevant for other EHS use cases such as Risk Management or Incident Management. In these scenarios, consistent master data ensures reliable assignment of responsibilities, correct categorization of materials, and accurate process execution. Across the organization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Therefore, in the following section, we will take a closer look at the general setup of the Business Partner and Material data integration between SAP MDG and SAP EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1439889394"&gt;2.

These ensure that master data replication works seamlessly and support EHS processes such as Emission Management. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To successfully set up this integration scenario, the following prerequisites must be in place: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Tenant Provisioning: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud tenant&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP MDG system should be available as the source system.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Administrator Access: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensure administrator users exist in both systems:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: The administrator should have the template role of &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/STRONG&gt; assigned to allow creation of communication users, systems, and arrangements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP MDG&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; for replication framework setup.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Scope Item Activation: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;While this section focuses on the setup required for Emission Management, the same integration scenario also enables other EHS functionalities like Incident Management and Risk Management.

If your on-premise system is currently not linked via any Cloud Connector, please refer to your SAP BASIS admin. Once the SAP MDG On-Premise system is added as mentioned before, the Cloud Connector then provides a secure tunnel and enables the use of &lt;STRONG&gt;virtual host names&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;and its corresponding&lt;STRONG&gt; virtual port&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which can be viewed in the SAP BTP Cockpit via &lt;EM&gt;Connectivity&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Cloud Connectors&lt;/EM&gt;.

In our scenario, we used the decentral configuration.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Navigate to SOAMANAGER in SAP MDG On-Premise System" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342206i71968A23626B02DB/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1763464210556.png" alt="Navigate to SOAMANAGER in SAP MDG On-Premise System" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Navigate to SOAMANAGER in SAP MDG On-Premise System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: To enable dynamic receiver determination, the Business Partner web service uses service groups in SOAMANAGER. Consequently, logical ports for the service consumer must not be created manually; instead, they must be generated automatically based on the integration scenario. This requires a WSDL-based configuration.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;De-Central Configuration Approach:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We selected the decentralized configuration approach because it provides the flexibility required for our system landscape. While SAP MDG remains the primary source for master data, SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud may also perform validations or localized adjustments. A decentralized setup is typically preferred when multiple systems need to manage master data independently, ensuring agility and avoiding reliance on a single central system.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Ensure that the &lt;STRONG&gt;Central Configuration &lt;/STRONG&gt;switch is set &lt;STRONG&gt;off&lt;/STRONG&gt; for this setup.

Lessons Learned&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Implementing 1RO for Business Partner and Product integration – from the SAP MDG On-Premise system to SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud – provided several valuable insights that are highly relevant for similar integration projects.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. Separate Replication Models Are Mandatory in DRF&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Even though Business Partner and Product replication steps look similar, each requires its own replication model in DRFIMG because outbound implementations (986_3 vs 194_3) are object specific. Trying to reuse the same model can cause conflicts.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Service Groups Are Crucial for Dynamic Routing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: The concept of service groups in SOAMANAGER is essential for Business Partner and Product replication. They enable dynamic receiver determination and simplify configuration. Ensure WSDL-based configuration is used to generate logical ports automatically.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3. Value Mapping Is Often Overlooked&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Differences in code lists (e.g., BP groupings, account groups, material types) between MDG and S/4HANA Public Cloud can cause replication failures. Plan value mapping early and verify mappings in both systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4. Cloud Connector Setup is required for integrations from an On-Premise System into Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Incorrect virtual host or missing SCC Location ID in the Communication System often leads to connectivity issues. Validate these settings before proceeding with SOAMANAGER configuration.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5. Monitoring Setup Is Critical for Operational Reliability&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Assign recipients in the “Assign Recipients to Users” app before using the Message Dashboard. Without this, replication errors will not be visible to the right users, delaying troubleshooting.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;6. Consistency in Product Number Harmonization&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: For Product replication, enabling “Product Number Harmonization” in the Communication Arrangement SAP_COM_0009 prevents duplicate products and ensures updates instead of new creations. This setting is often missed.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;7. Test with Small PACK_SIZE_BULK First in the DRF configuration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Start with a smaller bulk size (e.g., 10) during initial testing to simplify error analysis. Increase to the recommended 100 only after successful initial runs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;8. Documentation Alignment with 1RO&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: Always cross-check with SAP’s official 1RO documentation. Minor deviations (e.g., service names, WSDL variants) can lead to integration failures.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--345046088"&gt;5.

Why is this Integration required?&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integrating Functional Locations and Equipment master data from SAP S/4HANA On-Premise into SAP EHS Public Cloud is a foundational step for enabling core EHS processes such as Risk Management, Incident Management, and Emissions Management. Instead of maintaining asset-related data manually within SAP EHS Public Cloud, the system relies on validated Plant Maintenance (PM) master data coming from the customer’s existing ERP landscape. This ensures that all structures, machines, and technical objects involved in EHS processes remain consistent, reliable, and audit-proof across the enterprise.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Accurate and up-to-date Functional Location and Equipment data is essential because many EHS processes depend on a clear understanding of where work is performed and which technical objects is affected. This includes:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Identifying the exact machine or installation involved in an incident&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Linking hazards to the correct technical asset in Risk Assessments&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Performing control inspections and assigning follow-up actions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensuring asset-specific exposure, material usage, or emission characteristics are correctly evaluated&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Centralizing reporting across operational sites based on real asset hierarchies&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In other words: Without integrated Functional Location and Equipment data, SAP EHS Public Cloud cannot reliably assess risks, evaluate hazards, track incidents, or produce compliant operational reports.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Architectural Approach - Scope" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343913iB85C9F7E26B7FFA5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1763823302435.png" alt="Architectural Approach - Scope" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Architectural Approach - Scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The highlighted section of the architectural diagram illustrates the scope relevant to this blog post – focusing on the integration of Functional Locations and Equipment from SAP S/4HANA On-Premise into SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reference to User Scenario (B) – Risk Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-members/sap-ehs-public-cloud-extending-your-existing-landscape-side-by-side-a/ba-p/14264551" target="_self"&gt;part 1 “Introduction &amp;amp;

Technical Integration&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This section provides an overview of the technical integration required to replicate Plant Maintenance master data from SAP S/4HANA On-Premise to SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud for EHS processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The integration scenario builds on the activation of the &lt;STRONG&gt;scope item 4HH – Reactive Maintenance, &lt;/STRONG&gt;which delivers the necessary inbound services for Equipment and Functional Locations in the SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. These objects form the foundation for EHS capabilities such as Risk Management, Incident Management, or Emissions Management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The process shown in this integration scenario is &lt;STRONG&gt;event-driven. &lt;/STRONG&gt;This means, whenever changes occur to Plant Maintenance master data, such as Equipment or Functional Location in the On-Premise system, these updates are automatically replicated to the Public Cloud. This approach keeps both systems aligned without manual steps or scheduled batch jobs, ensuring that asset information is always current.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Keeping master data synchronized between both systems is critical for effective Risk Management because risk assessments and mitigation strategies depend on accurate details about assets and their locations. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By ensuring that updates flow seamlessly between systems, organizations can make informed decisions and maintain compliance across their EHS processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Configuration Areas:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise Configuration&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Configuration&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Integration Suite Configuration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Monitoring&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1176058781"&gt;3.1 SAP S/4HANA On-Premise Configuration&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As this integration scenario for Functional Locations and Equipment is event driven, the creation of channels was required in the SAP S/4HANA On-Premise system to publish business events to the SAP Integration Suite via Event Mesh.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this context the channels define the protocol (AMQP), destination (Event Mesh service key), and topic space. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Outbound bindings specify which event topics (e.g., sap/s4/beh/equipment/v1/Equipment/*) are sent.

Therefore, the SAP Integration Suite is responsible for retrieving Plant Maintenance master data (such as Functional Locations and Equipment) from the On-Premise system and delivering it to the Public Cloud using event-driven integration flows.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Since there is no pre-delivered integration package available for this scenario, we created two custom iFlows to handle the replication of Functional Location and Equipment data. Both iFlows follow a similar structure in terms of processing logic; however, they differ in the endpoints used for communication with SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud and the On-Premise system respectively.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Custom Integration Package for this Scenario" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343938i810946DE9EDEA384/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_17-1763824502634.png" alt="Custom Integration Package for this Scenario" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Custom Integration Package for this Scenario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-126060470"&gt;3.3.1&amp;nbsp;Establishing the Event Queue for On-Premise Triggers&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first step in this implementation is to create an &lt;STRONG&gt;Event Queue&lt;/STRONG&gt; in SAP Event Mesh using the Message Client. This queue serves as the trigger point for event-driven integration. When a change occurs in the SAP S/4HANA On-Premise system (such as an update to Functional Locations or Equipment), an event is published to the queue.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The iFlow will be later subscribed to the Event Queue and use the event as a trigger to start processing. Once triggered, the iFlow calls the related API in the On-Premise system to retrieve the full master data for the affected object.

In our demo environment, Basic Authentication was sufficient; however, for productive landscapes, certificate-based authentication is required to meet security standards and comply with enterprise policies. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For communication with&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Basic Authentication&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;was&amp;nbsp;used in this scenario. The credentials of the Inbound&amp;nbsp;Communication&amp;nbsp;User from SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud must therefore be&amp;nbsp;maintained&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;Security&amp;nbsp;Material&amp;nbsp;within the SAP Integration Suite. This configuration&amp;nbsp;ensures that the integration flow&amp;nbsp;can authenticate&amp;nbsp;securely when transmitting data to the SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Security Material" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343945i7360D1E3F176B96A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_24-1763824822604.png" alt="SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Security Material" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Security Material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Security Material that was used for communication with the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise&lt;/STRONG&gt; system, was created in a similar way using &lt;STRONG&gt;Basic Authentication,&lt;/STRONG&gt; based on the credentials of the On-Premise user. Note that the On-Premise user will be provided by your SAP BASIS team. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAP S/4HANA On-Premise Security Material" style="width: 904px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343946iBEC53739CC8475EF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_25-1763824857887.png" alt="SAP S/4HANA On-Premise Security Material" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise Security Material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For the Event Mesh Security Material that enables communication with SAP Event Mesh, &lt;STRONG&gt;OAuth 2.0&lt;/STRONG&gt; was used for authentication. Therefore, enter the &lt;STRONG&gt;Token Service&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;URL, Client ID &lt;/STRONG&gt;and&lt;STRONG&gt; Client Secret&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which are provided by the service key of your SAP Event Mesh Instance in SAP BTP Cockpit. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAP Integration Suite - Event Mesh Security Material" style="width: 957px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343947iD45E2F24D5EA124F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_26-1763824895448.png" alt="SAP Integration Suite - Event Mesh Security Material" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;SAP Integration Suite - Event Mesh Security Material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--342197909"&gt;3.3.3 Integration Flow (iFlow) Setup - Equipment&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regarding the iFlows we will setup the Equipment Integration iFlow first. Therefore, create the iFlow with a corresponding name, set &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA&lt;/STRONG&gt; as &lt;STRONG&gt;Sender&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/STRONG&gt; as &lt;STRONG&gt;Receiver&lt;/STRONG&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Sender and Receiver Setup for Equipment iFlow" style="width: 445px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343949i137C408FC5D67BAB/image-dimensions/445x180?v=v2" width="445" height="180" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_27-1763824941576.png" alt="Sender and Receiver Setup for Equipment iFlow" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Sender and Receiver Setup for Equipment iFlow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The integration flow starts with an &lt;STRONG&gt;AMQP connection&lt;/STRONG&gt; to SAP Event Mesh. This connection allows the iFlow to subscribe to event queues and consume messages whenever Functional Location or Equipment changes occur in the SAP S/4HANA On-Premise system. The AMQP protocol ensures reliable, event-driven communication between the systems and acts as the trigger for the subsequent OData calls.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Therefore, connect the &lt;STRONG&gt;Receiver&lt;/STRONG&gt; with the &lt;STRONG&gt;Start Message &lt;/STRONG&gt;using the Adapter Type AMQP with Websocket as Transport Protocol. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="First iFlow Step - AMQP Adapter Setup" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343950i4023AF8E0E1AFFD3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_28-1763824977022.png" alt="First iFlow Step - AMQP Adapter Setup" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;First iFlow Step - AMQP Adapter Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;General&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab inside the Adapter can stay as default. In the &lt;STRONG&gt;Connection&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab you need to add a Host, Port and Path of the Event Mesh Service Key. You will find this Service Key in the Event Mesh Instance of your SAP BTP Cockpit. For Authentication use OAuth 2.0 and add the associated Security Material for Event Mesh (created in the previous step) as Credential Name. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AMQP Adapter Connection Setup" style="width: 933px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343951i0FA1617C5142FA33/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_29-1763825008296.png" alt="AMQP Adapter Connection Setup" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;AMQP Adapter Connection Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AMQP Adapter Connection Setup" style="width: 933px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343952i157B04832F551E57/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_30-1763825030939.png" alt="AMQP Adapter Connection Setup" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;AMQP Adapter Connection Setup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the &lt;STRONG&gt;Processing&lt;/STRONG&gt; tab, add the event queue name for the equipment. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Assign Event Queue opn.equipment to AMQP Adapter" style="width: 771px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343953i1A81AACB9D7621B3/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_31-1763825062196.png" alt="Assign Event Queue opn.equipment to AMQP Adapter" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Assign Event Queue opn.equipment to AMQP Adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The incoming event message from SAP Event Mesh is delivered in &lt;STRONG&gt;JSON format&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

In this scenario, &lt;STRONG&gt;namespace mapping is disabled&lt;/STRONG&gt; because the JSON structure does not include namespaces that need to be preserved in the XML output. The remaining parts &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;of the Converter can stay as default. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="JSON to XML Converter" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343954iF8F8E0A52929ADAB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_32-1763825092929.png" alt="JSON to XML Converter" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;JSON to XML Converter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;After the conversion to XML, we added a &lt;STRONG&gt;Content Modifier&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

Accurate and timely event processing is essential because many risk-related processes depend on these events. Missing or delayed events can lead to incomplete risk assessments, gaps in safety measures, and potential compliance violations. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Monitoring can be performed at all three involved systems. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--931738424"&gt;3.4.1 SAP S/4HANA On-Premise&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Regarding the Outbound Events that are sent from the on-premise system to the SAP Integration Suite, you can navigate to &lt;STRONG&gt;SPRO &lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;ABAP Platform &lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Enterprise Event Enablement &lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Monitoring &lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Monitor Event Queues. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;If any failures for the Outbound Events occur, they can be analyzed here.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Event Monitor in SAP S/4HANA On-Premise System" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343992i07002DCA3D1A551B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_63-1763826290152.png" alt="Event Monitor in SAP S/4HANA On-Premise System" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Event Monitor in SAP S/4HANA On-Premise System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1128251929"&gt;3.4.2 SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, monitoring focuses on API communication rather than event queues. The primary tool that can be used here is the “&lt;STRONG&gt;OData Error Log&lt;/STRONG&gt;” app, which provides detailed error messages for failed OData requests. This is essential for troubleshooting issues when SAP Integration Suite sends data to the Public Cloud system.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="OData Error Log in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud System" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/343993iB3EBC4F9679BD946/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_64-1763826338886.png" alt="OData Error Log in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud System" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;OData Error Log in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1324765434"&gt;3.4.3 SAP Integration Suite&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;SAP Integration Suite&amp;nbsp;provides several&amp;nbsp;tools to track and manage integrations flows. As already described already in the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-members/sap-ehs-public-cloud-extending-your-existing-landscape-side-by-side-a/ba-p/14266901" target="_self"&gt;part 2&lt;/A&gt; you can therefore navigate within the SAP Integration Suite to &lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor &lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Overview &lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Manage Integration Content&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;.

Lessons Learned&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Implementing this integration scenario via the scope item &lt;STRONG&gt;4HH&lt;/STRONG&gt; for Plant Maintenance data (such as Functional Locations or Equipment) from the SAP S/4HANA On-Premise system to SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud provided several valuable insights that are highly relevant for similar integration projects.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. Event-Driven Integration Ensures Real-Time Accuracy:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Using SAP Event Mesh with AMQP is critical for keeping Functional Location and Equipment data synchronized. Batch jobs cannot guarantee timely updates for EHS processes like Risk Management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Validate OData Services Early:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Missing activation of &lt;STRONG&gt;API_EQUIPMENT&lt;/STRONG&gt; or &lt;STRONG&gt;API_FUNCTIONALLOCATION&lt;/STRONG&gt; in the on-premise system is a common root cause for iFlow failures. Always check via /IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE before starting.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3. Topic Naming in Event Mesh Requires Precision:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Incorrect prefixes or typos in topic subscriptions will block event processing entirely. Always cross-check against SAP Business Accelerator Hub references.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4. Message Mapping Is Compliance-Critical:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensure that Equipment and Functional Location data is transformed correctly for SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud. Missing mandatory fields can lead to incomplete risk assessments and reporting gaps.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5. Monitoring Is Essential for Operational Reliability:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Event-driven integration depends on timely message processing. Use monitoring tools in all three systems (SAP S/4HANA On-Premise, SAP Integration Suite, and SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud) to detect and resolve issues early.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;6. Plan Authentication Strategy Upfront:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Basic Authentication works for demos, but production environments require certificate-based authentication. Delaying this switch can cause project delays and security risks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1130986430"&gt;5.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Disclaimer: This blog post reflects the state of SAP Responsible Design and Production as of November 25, 2025.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/rdp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Responsible Design and Production&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;released User-Defined Reports (UDR) this year, extending its reporting framework with a fully configurable, customer-driven approach developed to support customers with the ever-evolving and growing number of &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/responsible-design-and-production/what-is-extended-producer-responsibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Extended Producer Responsibility&lt;/A&gt; (EPR) regulations. With UDR, users can now create customized EPR reports for packaging based on their unique business and compliance needs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;UDR also enables SAP and in the near future, content partners, to offer templates for new EPR schemes that customers can adapt in their own systems, to help them expand EPR reporting quickly. This new functionality aims to ease the burden of managing reporting obligations across multiple markets.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;This blog post explains the background and motivation for this feature, provides a sneak peek into the key functionalities used to create country-specific EPR report categories, and highlights how this enhancement improves flexibility and extensibility for EPR data reporting.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1895458383"&gt;Background&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;As EPR regulations continue to expand globally, businesses face increasing complexity in how they manage compliance. Regulations vary not only from country to country but often overlap or undergo changes over time, making it challenging for customers to keep up while relying on predefined reporting structures.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;SAP Responsible Design and Production has long supported customers in meeting EPR requirements through SAP-provided report categories that are preconfigured to match the packaging obligations in countries such as Spain, Italy, and the UK. While these reports have served as a reliable foundation, there is a growing need for a more flexible and more nuanced reporting approach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Companies increasingly require a way to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Adapt quickly to new or changing legislation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reuse rules and fee structures across similar reporting schemes or Producer Responsibility Organizations (PROs)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Consolidate data from diverse sources&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customize reporting logic based on their specific business context&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;This is exactly why SAP introduced User-Defined Reports (UDR): to provide customers with an agile, scalable, and future-ready foundation for building report categories aligned with regulatory logic, business context, and compliance requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569862159"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Capabilities of UDR&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;User-Defined Reports bring together several powerful capabilities that allow customers to design report categories tailored to their specific regulatory and operational needs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Salwa_Burhan_4-1764441893126.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346662iC54A22AA0AFD383F/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Salwa_Burhan_4-1764441893126.png" alt="Salwa_Burhan_4-1764441893126.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1502431373"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1 Build the Structure of Your Report&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1435000587"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Responsible Organizations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;EPR schemes are managed by Producer Responsibility Organizations (PROs). Many countries operate with more than one PRO, each offering different fee structures or criteria. In Spain, for example, Ecoembes manages general packaging, while Ecovidrio is responsible for glass packaging. UDR allows users to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Attach&amp;nbsp;multiple PRO-specific fee tables&amp;nbsp;to the same report category&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reuse the same report fractions and rules across PROs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Avoid creating separate report categories for each PRO (as long as their rules do not conflict)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;This gives customers flexibility in markets where several PROs coexist.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1238487082"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Report Fractions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Report fractions are the foundational building blocks of a UDR report. They represent the categories into which packaging is classified according to national legislation or PRO requirements. Fractions can be created and named based on the exact fee structure of the country or PRO, ensuring a one-to-one alignment with how fees are calculated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Salwa_Burhan_0-1764440973303.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346651i5B824E2F6D46886A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Salwa_Burhan_0-1764440973303.png" alt="Salwa_Burhan_0-1764440973303.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1041973577"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Report Fraction Groups&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;To support cleaner structuring and reporting layouts, fractions can be combined into&amp;nbsp;report fraction groups. These groups help users organize related fractions (for example, separating paper-related fractions based on usage or the brand) and simplify both calculation and reporting outputs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Salwa_Burhan_1-1764441054240.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346652iBEA93DBE1E1C2C27/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Salwa_Burhan_1-1764441054240.png" alt="Salwa_Burhan_1-1764441054240.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-716377353"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2 Control the Logic Behind Your Report&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-648946567"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Filters for Included Packaging&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Filters add a foundational layer of control by allowing users to exclude packaging that should not be part of a particular report or fee calculation. They can be applied at multiple levels within the report category setup and help ensure that only relevant data is included based on the requirements of each EPR scheme.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Together with calculation rules, filters help shape a reporting outcome that aligns with legislative and business requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Salwa_Burhan_2-1764441115048.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346653i4ECF0A5828AD141A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Salwa_Burhan_2-1764441115048.png" alt="Salwa_Burhan_2-1764441115048.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-452433062"&gt;Calculation Rules&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Report calculation rules form one of the most powerful elements of UDR.&lt;BR /&gt;They determine which packaging is included in a report and how quantities and fees are calculated, giving customers the flexibility to reflect the exact compliance logic required by each market. Because calculation rules can combine multiple conditions, attributes, and data sources, they enable users to shape reporting logic precisely around their business and regulatory needs, making this capability central to the flexibility that UDR offers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-responsible-design-and-production/user-guide-sap-rdp/calculation-rules?locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Calculation rules&lt;/A&gt; come with&amp;nbsp;a wide collection of rule examples, expressions and functions that can be leveraged to fit the users’ reporting requirements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Salwa_Burhan_3-1764441167803.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346656iAAC09838E256480A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Salwa_Burhan_3-1764441167803.png" alt="Salwa_Burhan_3-1764441167803.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-255919557"&gt;Logistic Processes&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Logistic processes represent the specific movements of products or packaging that are relevant for a country’s EPR legislation, such as domestic sales, imports, exports, or other flows defined by the market. In UDR, users can select which logistic processes apply to their report category and combine them with filters or calculation rules. This allows the user to reflect only the movements that are obligated in that country, ensuring the report aligns with how packaging enters or leaves the market.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Salwa_Burhan_0-1764441588429.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346658i7A62E811A2A41E5E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Salwa_Burhan_0-1764441588429.png" alt="Salwa_Burhan_0-1764441588429.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--144908036"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3 Capture Sustainability-Driven Criteria&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--634824548"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ecomodulation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Many EPR schemes increasingly use ecomodulation to reward sustainable packaging choices. UDR allows users to set ecomodulation criteria based on the relevant EPR scheme and incorporate them into calculation rules. This further enables fees to be calculated according to the required ecomodulation rules. To learn more about ecomodulation, visit the SAP Responsible Design and Production community page for a detailed blog on this topic, releasing soon.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Salwa_Burhan_1-1764441628727.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346659i073BD60C2AD049E5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Salwa_Burhan_1-1764441628727.png" alt="Salwa_Burhan_1-1764441628727.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--831338053"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Recyclability&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;UDR also integrates recyclability outcomes directly into reports. When setting up a report, recyclability guidelines can be selected and applied, to be used in calculation rules when needed. This allows recyclability insights to feed directly into the report structure, supporting countries where recyclability affects fees or criteria (such as the bonus/malus payments on EPR fees in France). Users can either upload date manually via Excel or integrate with a partner of their choice.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Salwa_Burhan_2-1764441646013.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346660iBED74D0FFB06ACA9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Salwa_Burhan_2-1764441646013.png" alt="Salwa_Burhan_2-1764441646013.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--734448551"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4 Test and Validate Your Setup&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1224365063"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Test Configuration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;With test configurations, users can simulate the reporting outcome for one to ten products. This enables quick validation of rule logic, filters, and fee calculations before generating the full report, ensuring accuracy and reducing iteration time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Salwa_Burhan_3-1764441669657.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346661i812B05AD0CEA73BF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Salwa_Burhan_3-1764441669657.png" alt="Salwa_Burhan_3-1764441669657.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1127475561"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;5 Templates&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Not all EPR schemes have the same level of complexity. To ease the effort in building highly detailed report categories using UDR, Templates have been introduced; preconfigured starter packs that provide the structure and logic needed to get started, which can be adapted to fit the user’s requirements. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Currently, SAP provides Templates for US-Colorado, US-Oregon, and Denmark, with more to follow. Keep an eye on the &lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?SC=000D3AAC9DD21EDCA0CEF4AE3E045374&amp;amp;range=FIRST-LAST#;INNO=000D3AAC9DD21FD091DB1634B3B7B4CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Responsible Design and Production Roadmap&lt;/A&gt; for upcoming additions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1030586059"&gt;Customer Response &amp;amp; Early Results&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;Customers who tested UDR shared strong and practical feedback, including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“Only 25% of time and effort is required for using UDR compared to manual efforts.” (from consumer products company)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;“First we were skeptic, but now we like using UDR.” (from food processing company)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;These early insights reflect the impact of a flexible, user-driven reporting approach. To see this in a real-world setting, please check out our recent webinar, &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/5062340/A101DCD33FDF7185899613F2B7FEF038" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Navigating EPR regulations in the United States: Act Now!&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; where our customer shares their experience with UDR.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1227099564"&gt;What’s Next&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;UDR was shaped with direct input from customers, and this collaboration will continue. As EPR regulations evolve, SAP will focus on enhancing UDR, improving the configuration experience, and supporting reporting needs across markets.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;One of the planned enhancements is around AI-assisted features that could make it easier to create calculation rules logic and work more efficiently with UDR using natural language.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1423613069"&gt;Where to Learn More and Act!&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-left" style="text-align : left;"&gt;To further explore UDR, detailed &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-responsible-design-and-production/user-guide-sap-rdp/create-user-defined-report-categories?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;documentation&lt;/A&gt; with practical examples and additional guidance on &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-responsible-design-and-production/user-guide-sap-rdp/calculation-rules?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;calculation rules&lt;/A&gt; &amp;nbsp;available.

T&lt;/SPAN&gt;he event took place at &lt;A href="https://www.kd2lab.kit.edu/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Karlsruhe Decision &amp;amp; Design Lab&lt;/A&gt; (KD²lab), a DFG-funded experimental lab located in the heart of Karlsruhe.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1697303486"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Business Software meets Behavioral Science&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-left" image-alt="Dr. Julia Seitz registering a study participant at KD2lab (copyright: KIT/Amadeus Bramsiepe)." style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345973i280D6B6588291CBE/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="KD2Lab_smallest.jpeg" alt="Dr. Julia Seitz registering a study participant at KD2lab (copyright: KIT/Amadeus Bramsiepe)." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Dr. Julia Seitz registering a study participant at KD2lab (copyright: KIT/Amadeus Bramsiepe).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;KD²lab at KIT&lt;/STRONG&gt; is one of the world's largest computer-based behavioral science experimental laboratories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;40 soundproof computer cubicles, climate-controlled experimental rooms, and high-resolution biosignal measu&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;rement equipment (including eye tracking, ECG, and EEG) enable researchers to capture neuro- and psychophysiological processe&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;s under controlled conditions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://h-lab.win.kit.edu/2236_2287.php" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Dr. Julia Seitz&lt;/A&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;is Research Team Lead for two research streams at h-lab: &lt;STRONG&gt;Agentic Enterprise Systems&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;Biosignal-Adaptive Collaboration Systems&lt;/STRONG&gt;. She&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;combines psychological theories and behavioral economics approaches in her experimental research on human-centered information systems design.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Focusing on collaboration in teams of humans and AI&amp;nbsp;agents, Dr. Seitz is particularly interested in how adaptive and agentic information systems in the workplace impact users. In her research, she combines qualitative and quantitative empirical methods with real-time processing of biosignal data to explore how agentic software design can improve outcomes and collaboration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1500789981"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI for Sustainability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the collaborative project "&lt;STRONG&gt;Agentic Information Systems for Sustainability&lt;/STRONG&gt;" with SAP, Dr. Seitz is working alongside &lt;A href="https://h-lab.win.kit.edu/team_3404.php" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Anna Sommer&lt;/A&gt;, SAP PhD student at KIT, to explore a crucial question: How can generative AI agents and humans work together optimally to drive sustainable business practices?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-right" image-alt="SAP PhD student Anna Sommer." style="width: 200px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345967iD54E797635D1D7CD/image-size/small/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=200" role="button" title="Anna_sommer.jpeg" alt="SAP PhD student Anna Sommer." /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;SAP PhD student Anna Sommer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Using human-centered AI design approaches and hands-on experimental research, the team is investigating the dynamic interplay between humans and generative agents, identifying which forms of interaction deliver the most impactful results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"The project's ambition is to develop AI systems that truly complement human expertise rather than replace it: Systems that enhance rather than diminish critical thinking, enable more efficient resource management, and strengthen both ecological and social sustainability," says Anna Sommer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In her current study, she is investigating how the use of AI agents influences cognitive processes—particularly critical thinking—and whether these effects differ between different AI agents. To do this, participants first complete a critical thinking test with the help of an AI agent. In a second part of the study, this test is replaced with a realistic task from the field of sustainability management requiring critical thinking. This part takes place in the KD²lab and is supplemented by additional measurement methods such as eye tracking.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ultimately, Anna Sommer's goal is to develop guidelines for AI agents that actively foster critical thinking rather than hinder it—an ability that is becoming increasingly vital for businesses striving for sustainable success.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1304276476"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":speech_balloon:"&gt;💬&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Get in Touch with the SAP Research Community&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Want to participate or know more about the partnership between SAP and KIT?

This flexibility ensures that sustainability tracking can be tailored to the specific needs of your organization. Whether you focus on carbon emissions, resource consumption, or environmental compliance, customizable queries allow you to capture the exact data you need.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The enhancements to the Sustainability Control Tower in DM mark a significant step forward in the integration of sustainability into business operations. With API access for data retrieval and the ability to create customizable queries, DM empowers users to take control of their sustainability programs, drive transparency, and achieve meaningful results.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1178730211" id="toc-hId-1828090956"&gt;XBRL TEMPL CREATION PLG 10.1&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Boosting Creation Performance for Most Entry Points&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In today's fast-paced business environment, efficiency and speed are crucial for success. One of the key aspects of maintaining operational excellence is the ability to create and manage multiple entry points swiftly and reliably. With the release of DM Stack 2300, we are excited to introduce significant performance enhancements specifically designed to boost the creation process for most entry points.&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dynamic Gray Cells in Template Scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;In the latest update to XBRL TEMPL CREATION PLG 10.1, we have introduced a significant enhancement aimed at improving user experience and data entry efficiency: dynamic gray cells in template scenarios. This feature ensures that cells in your templates are only grayed out when necessary, allowing you to enter data into as many dimension combinations as possible.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1964784231" id="toc-hId-1631577451"&gt;DM XBRL Mapper 10.1&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced Context, Unit, and Dimension Mapping&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Previously, when working with contexts, units, and dimensions in Microsoft Word, users often found it challenging to keep track of which concepts these elements were being added to. This lack of visibility could lead to errors and inefficiencies, making the process more cumbersome and time-consuming.&lt;BR /&gt;With the latest update to the XBRL Mapper, you can now instantly see in each tab which concept your contexts, units, and dimensions are being added to while working in Microsoft Word. Additionally, you have the ability to select and deselect these elements before finalizing your entries, ensuring precision and clarity.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Introduction: Why Extensibility Matters in EHS Implementations&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Implementing SAP Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety (EHS) in the Public Cloud provides customers with a powerful set of standard capabilities across EHS functionality such as Incident Management, Risk Management, or Emissions Management. However, real-life EHS processes often include country-specific regulations, industry-dependent reporting obligations, and customer-individual workflows that cannot always be covered by the standard product alone. This is where extensibility becomes a critical success factor.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;From our project experience, we see that nearly every EHS implementation requires selected adaptations – whether to incorporate local legal requirements, enrich analytics, adjust incident forms, or create custom validations. With SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud and SAP EHS, such enhancements must follow SAP’s clean-core principles, meaning they must be implemented using the officially supported extensibility technologies.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This blog post provides a clear, practical overview of the extensibility options available for SAP EHS in the Public Cloud and demonstrates how they can be applied to real-world scenarios.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569925485"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.1 What You Can Expect from This Blog Post&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this part, we outline the extensibility landscape for EHS Public Cloud and guide you through:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Which extensibility options exist in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How they apply specifically to EHS use cases&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Which BAdIs are available and when to use them&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Concrete examples for extensibility&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Best practices based on our project experience&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The aim is to give implementation teams a practical understanding of how to adapt the system without breaking the clean core, ensuring long-term upgradeability and compliance.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373411980"&gt;1.2 Why Extensibility is Especially Important for EHS&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;From our project experience, EHS is one of the most extensibility-driven domains in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud because:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regulations differ significantly by country (e.g. OSHA, EU directives, etc.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Incident reports must reflect local legal requirements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Customers require tailored analytics and KPIs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Integration with external safety systems is common&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Forms and regulatory outputs often need custom structures&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EHS processes must adapt to organizational legal, and operational needs. Extensibility in Public Cloud ensures this adaptability without compromising SAP’s clean-core principles.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1047815756"&gt;2. Extensibility Options in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud provides a comprehensive extensibility portfolio designed to support innovation without compromising the stability of the core system. These capabilities range from low-code configuration tools for business users to pro-code development environments for technical teams. Understanding these options is essential for designing scalable, future-proof EHS solutions – especially in Public Cloud environments where clean-core principles are mandatory.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Extensibility Portfolio for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition (Own illustration based on SAP source: https://www.sap.com/documents/2018/05/606d1ee8-037d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html)" style="width: 944px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347874i1304234FEF42570A/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1764753375608.png" alt="Extensibility Portfolio for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition (Own illustration based on SAP source: https://www.sap.com/documents/2018/05/606d1ee8-037d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html)" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Extensibility Portfolio for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition (Own illustration based on SAP source: https://www.sap.com/documents/2018/05/606d1ee8-037d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-980384970"&gt;2.1 Low-Code vs. Pro-Code Extensibility&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The extensibility portfolio is structured along two axes:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Low-Code&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Target at key user and functional experts who need to quickly adapt user interfaces, create fields, or adjust logic without deep technical development.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pro-Code&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Designed for professional developers who require advanced capabilities through the ABAP Cloud development model or SAP BTP services.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These options are distributed across two major extensibility categories: &lt;STRONG&gt;On-Stack Extensibility (In-App)&lt;/STRONG&gt;

Our objective is to demonstrate what can be achieved directly within the SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, using standard in-app extensibility options that remain fully aligned with SAP’s clean-core principles. Based on our project experience, most EHS related enhancements such as custom fields, logic, reporting extensions, and form adaptations can be delivered efficiently using Key User or Developer Extensibility (on-stack). For this reason, the upcoming chapters focus exclusively on in-app, upgrade-safe extensibility scenarios that can be implemented without additional BTP architecture.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--2182555"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2.4 BAdIs in the Public Cloud (Key User vs. Developer Access)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) are predefined extension points provided by SAP that allow injecting custom logic while staying upgrade safe.

While Developer Extensibility via ABAP Cloud provides a more advanced pro-code extension model, the current EHS-specific enhancement points are mostly delivered as in-app, low-code BAdIs to ensure upgrade stability and full alignment with SAP’s clean core principles.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This corresponds closely with our experience from project implementations: Most EHS extension requirements can be delivered efficiently using in-app, Key User Extensibility tools such as Custom Fields, Custom Logic, UI Adaptation, and CDS View extensions without requiring developer access.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-441961304"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3. Practical Extensibility Scenarios in EHS&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In chapter 2, we explored the extensibility options available in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud and outlined which of these options are most relevant for EHS implementations. As highlighted, the majority of extensibility points currently exposed in the EHS area (especially within Incident Management and Emissions Management) are implemented using Key User Extensibility, including custom fields, UI adaptation, form template configuration, and Custom Logic BAdIs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Because of this, this chapter focuses exclusively on Key User Extensibility in practice, demonstrating how customers can solve real-world EHS requirements entirely within the Public Cloud without requiring developer extensibility or SAP BTP side-by-side extensions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Drawing from our project experience, we selected two scenarios that reflect &lt;STRONG&gt;common customer requirements&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Adding custom attributes to the Incident Management process&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Generating a country-specific incident report, using custom form templates and multiple BAdIs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Both scenarios illustrate how far customers can go using the extensibility tools embedded in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, while fully adhering to the clean-core principle.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--47955208"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3.1 Example 1 - Introducing a Custom Attribute for Incident Records&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extensibility Type: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key User Extensibility&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Tools &amp;amp; Apps Used:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Custom Fields App (SAP Fiori App)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UI Adaptation (SAP Fiori Settings)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--537871720"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3.1.1 Business Requirement&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Many organizations require an additional field “Business Unit” to be captured as part of incident documentation to meet internal reporting needs, support organizational analysis, or fulfill local compliance requirements. Since this information is not available in the standard SAP EHS Public Cloud data model, customers often need to introduce it as a custom field.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Typically, the Business Unit may be required in multiple stages of the Incident Management process, such as:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Incident Creation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Incident Processing&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reporting and Analytics Dashboards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In our case, the Business Unit field was only added to the Incident Processing step, primarily for simplicity and to demonstrate the extensibility approach in clear and focused manner. However, this field can be added to additional UIs and process steps as needed, depending on the customer’s specific requirements, organizational structure, or compliance obligations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--734385225"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3.1.2 Step-by-Step Implementation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create New Custom Field&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this step a custom field for the Incident Management will be created using the “&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Fields&lt;/STRONG&gt;” Fiori App. You can follow the steps below to create a custom field:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1. Navigate to the “&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Fields&lt;/STRONG&gt;” app from the Fiori Launchpad.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;2. Click “&lt;STRONG&gt;Create&lt;/STRONG&gt;”.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3.

These reports often require a combination of standard fields, people related information, and custom fields that are not provided in the SAP EHS Public Cloud standard forms. For example, organizations operating in Australia may be required to submit the &lt;EM&gt;WHS Form 10&lt;/EM&gt;, a mandatory workplace health and safety report documenting incidents, injuries, or hazards in accordance with the Australian Work Health and Safety (WHS) Regulations (made-up). To support this requirement, a custom Adobe form template must be created and populated with incident data, including custom fields. This requires implementing the relevant Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) to retrieve, map, and supply the correct incident information into the custom form.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The report must include:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Basic incident details&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Person and involvement information&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Custom fields required for the local legislative format&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1323925740"&gt;3.2.2 Step-by-Step Implementation&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Develop a Custom Form in Adobe Lifecycle Designer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A custom form template needs to be created to meet the specific requirements of the report. The form should include all necessary fields. To showcase this example, we created the form template &lt;STRONG&gt;YY1_WHS_FORM10&lt;/STRONG&gt; in &lt;STRONG&gt;Adobe Lifecycle Designer&lt;/STRONG&gt; and saved it as an &lt;STRONG&gt;xdp&lt;/STRONG&gt; file.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Form Template Creation in Adobe Lifecycle Designer" style="width: 945px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347992i0AA133E7BBF17435/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="duynguyendeloitte_0-1764764530957.png" alt="Form Template Creation in Adobe Lifecycle Designer" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Form Template Creation in Adobe Lifecycle Designer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Upload Custom Form in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once the custom form template is created in Adobe Lifecycle Designer, the next step is to upload it to SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud by using the “&lt;STRONG&gt;Maintain Form Template&lt;/STRONG&gt;” app. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1.

Enter a &lt;STRONG&gt;Form Template Name&lt;/STRONG&gt; of your choice (for example “&lt;STRONG&gt;YY1_WHS_FORM10&lt;/STRONG&gt;” including the prefix “YY1_” for custom forms).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;5.&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Upload the form file&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; that you created in Adobe Lifecycle Designer.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;6.

Summary &amp;amp; Lessons Learned&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extensibility plays a critical role in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud implementations for Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS). As demonstrated throughout this blog post, even highly regulated processes such as incident reporting or country-specific compliance documentation can be effectively supported using SAP’s clean-core extensibility framework.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Drawing from our project experience and the two practical use cases presented, this chapter summarizes the key takeaways and highlights the most important lessons learned when implementing extensibility in EHS Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1423549743"&gt;4.1 Key Takeaways&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clean-Core Extensibility Is Not a Limitation – It is a Design Principle&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP Public Cloud model enforces strict boundaries around what can be extended. Rather than restricting customers, these boundaries ensure: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Long-term upgrade protection&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Predictable lifecycle behavior&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Lower maintenance effort&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Full SAP supportability&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;All enhancements must therefore rely on SAP-released extension points.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Most EHS Requirements Can Be Solved with Key User Extensibility&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A major insight from our implementations is that the majority of EHS use cases do not require developer extensibility or side-by-side applications.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key User tools already cover:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Custom data fields&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;UI adaptations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;PDF report adjustments&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BAdI logic&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Both examples in this blog were fully implemented using Key User Extensibility only.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BAdIs Are the Backbone of EHS Extensibility&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP delivers a growing catalogue of EHS specific BAdIs in the Public Cloud, particularly for:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Incident Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Emissions Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key lessons:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Each BAdI is designed for a very specific business context.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You often need to use several BAdIs together to populate a report for a form.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;They enable retrieving structured data via released CDS Views and APIs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clean and modular implementations significantly improve maintainability.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Custom Forms Require a Structured Approach&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regulatory reports require a combination of:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A form template (Adobe)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Custom fields&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;BAdI logic&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;CBC configuration&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The lesson: Form extensibility is not only a technical activity – it is a cross-functional exercise involving business, logic, and configuration layers.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Configuration in SAP Central Business Configuration (CBC) / Implementation Activities is Essential&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EHS reporting relies heavily on CBC / Implementation Activities, especially when assigning:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Forms &amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;form groups&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Form groups &amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;regulations&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regulations &amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;incident categories&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A common project challenge: Without correct CBC (or Implementation Activities) configuration, even perfectly implemented forms and BAdIs will not appear in the UI.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;End-to-End Testing Is Crucial&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Because EHS extensions span UI, logic, reporting and configuration layers, testing must always validate the entire lifecycle:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Incident creation &amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;processing &amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;regulation selection &amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;report generation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This avoids fragmented testing and ensures that all extension layers work together seamlessly.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1620063248"&gt;4.2 Lessons Learned&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Start With the Simplest Possible Extension Option&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Always begin with Key User tools before considering Developer Extensibility or SAP BTP. Public Cloud projects succeed when complexity is added only where absolutely necessary.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Choose BAdIs Wisely – Don’t Over-Engineer&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Each BAdI serves a narrow purpose. Trying to force a single BAdI to solve multiple needs often causes issues later. Modular, purpose-aligned implementations are easier to maintain and debug.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Document Custom Logic and Configuration Thoroughly&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Because Public Cloud enforces strict structure, even small enhancements should be:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Named consistently (YY1_*)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Documented cleanly (purpose, input, output)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Readable for team members who join the project later.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Well-documented extensions also reduce future rework during audits or regulatory updates.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Maintain a Strong Governance Around Extensibility&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Typical governance measures include:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reviewing whether a need truly requires an extension&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Maintaining a central register of custom fields and BAdIs&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensuring no duplicate fields are created&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Enforcing naming conventions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This prevents uncontrolled growth of extensions over time.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Engage Business Users Early in the Design Process&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EHS professionals often know exactly how regulations should be represented. Early involvement helps:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Avoid unnecessary extensions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Validate report layouts&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Confirm the accuracy of populated data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ensure usability in real operational scenarios&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Plan for Future Regulatory Requirements&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;EHS compliance evolves frequently. When building extensions, always think ahead:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Could this field or form be reused for another regulation?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Can we structure the logic to accommodate more categories in the future?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Are we using modular BAdI implementations that can scale?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This significantly reduces technical dept.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1648393062"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;4.3 Best Practices&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To close this chapter, here is a consolidated best-practice checklist:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Use SAP-released extension points only (clean core).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Prefer Key User Extensibility for EHS whenever possible.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Keep BAdI implementations modular and business-context specific.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Use functional naming conventions for fields, forms, and BAdIs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Perform end-to-end lifecycle testing (UI &amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;logic &amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;form &amp;gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;CBC).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Document every extension early, including purpose and data sources.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reuse released CDS Views and APIs – never rely on unreleased objects.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Involve business users early to ensure regulatory accuracy.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Build form templates in a future-proof, scalable structure.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Maintain strong governance to avoid unnecessary or duplicate extensions.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1844906567"&gt;4.4 Final Remark&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extensibility in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is not about pushing technical boundaries. It is about using the right tools to deliver business value while protecting system integrity. With a structured approach, as illustrated in both examples, customers can achieve regulatory compliance, process optimization, and system flexibility without compromising the clean-core principles that define the Public Cloud.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--1748017065"&gt;5.

Managing critical documentation such as Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) or product labels manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, slowing down operations and creating risk.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA for Product Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;, organizations can simplify and automate compliance documentation across all markets. The &lt;STRONG&gt;Compliance Document Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; capability centralizes all regulatory documents, ensuring they are accurate, up to date, and distributed automatically to the right recipients.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What makes this approach so powerful is that it’s &lt;STRONG&gt;fully integrated into core business processes&lt;/STRONG&gt;. From product creation to final delivery, the system checks for required documentation, issues automatic notifications if something is missing, and ensures that all shipments comply with global regulations. Updates to documents are handled automatically, so customers always receive the latest, legally valid versions without additional effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What the Video Covers:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How SAP S/4HANA automates compliance document creation, monitoring, and distribution&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How integrated checks prevent non-compliant deliveries&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How analytics ensure transparency and proactive compliance management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And how automation helps reduce risk and accelerate global product launches&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This topic is especially close to my heart because I believe that &lt;STRONG&gt;compliance, when automated and embedded&lt;/STRONG&gt;, is not a burden but a business advantage. It ensures safety, builds trust, and enables companies to operate globally, with confidence and efficiency.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_bxe2zh5b" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP Video - In brief: SAP Product Compliance - Compliance Document Management&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watch the video and let’s discuss how &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA for Product Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt; can help your organization transform documentation management into a strategic strength.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Summary&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In this blog series, we shared our hands-on experience from multiple SAP EHS Public Cloud projects that were implemented in a hybrid, side-by-side landscape. Across Parts 1 to 5, we covered the integration of Employees, Business Partners, Materials, Functional Locations, and Equipment, as well as practical extensibility scenarios from real customer use cases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;What became very clear throughout these projects is that SAP EHS Public Cloud works best when three things come together:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Consistent master data,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Standardized integration content,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And a disciplined clean-core extensibility strategy.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In practice, we saw that missing or inconsistent master data was the most common root cause for broken end-to-end EHS processes (far more critical than any technical limitation). Once HR data, business partners, materials and assets were properly aligned across systems, incident reporting, emissions calculations, and follow-up processes became significantly more stable and transparent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Another key learning was that standard communication scenarios and scope items save a tremendous amount of time and risk. Whenever we were able to rely on delivered content instead of custom interfaces, implementation effort, testing effort, and long-term maintenance were reduced noticeably.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Finally, extensibility played an important role in every single project. While most requirements could be solved using in-app Key User Extensibility, it was essential to define clear governance early on to avoid country-specific deviations and long-term technical debt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This final part summarizes the key benefits and pitfalls we repeatedly encountered and shares our outlook on how SAP EHS in the Public Cloud will continue to evolve based on what we see today in real projects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1440956169"&gt;2. Benefits &amp;amp; Pitfalls&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Integrating SAP EHS as part of a hybrid SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud landscape delivers strong business value but it also introduces architectural and organizational challenges that need to be managed carefully. In this chapter, we summarize the most important benefits and pitfalls we encountered across different customer projects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373525383"&gt;2.1 Benefits&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fast Access to Innovation through Public Cloud Releases &amp;amp; AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;One of the strongest benefits we experienced in our projects was the direct access to new EHS functionality without classical upgrade projects. Unlike on-premise systems with long release cycles, customers benefit immediately from:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Regular Public Cloud releases and micro deliveries&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fast availability of new EHS features and regulatory content&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Immediate access to SAP’s latest AI-driven innovations in EHS scenarios&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This had a noticeable impact on time-to-value. Instead of waiting months for technical upgrades, functional improvements became available continuously. For several customers, this was also the first time AI-supported features in the EHS context could be evaluated productively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Data Consistency and Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;A unified master data landscape turned out to be one of the biggest success factors across all projects. By integrating:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Employee data from SAP SuccessFactors&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Business Partners &amp;amp; Materials from SAP MDG&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Functional Locations and Equipment from SAP S/4HANA On-Premise&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We ensured that EHS processes consistently relied on harmonized and validated master data. In practice, this was essential for:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accurate incident reporting,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reliable emissions calculations,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Correct assignment of responsibilities and workflows,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Audit-proof regulatory documentation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Where master data was incomplete or inconsistent, downstream EHS processes were immediately affected.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Hybrid Architecture without Disruption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The side-by-side approach allowed customers to adopt EHS innovations in the Public Cloud without shutting down their existing on-premise environments. This enabled:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Gradual modernization instead of big-bang migrations,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduced transformation risk,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Protection of critical operational processes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;From a project perspective, this phased approach proved to be far more controllable than technical full-system replacements.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Standardized Interfaces and Scope Items&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Whenever we could rely on standard SAP communication scenarios and scope items, the implantation became significantly faster and more stable. Examples include:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP_COM_0001, 0008, 0009, 0395&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;EHS scope items such as 3FP (Incident Management), 4XD (Emissions Management), and 54A (Health &amp;amp; Safety Management)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;These accelerators reduced custom development effort, simplified testing, and aligned customer landscapes with SAP best practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Scalability and Future Readiness&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The event-driven and API-first architecture of the Public Cloud supported scalable growth across all projects. Typical examples were:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Near real-time updated via SAP Integration Suite and Event Mesh,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Flexible replication cycles for HR and MDG data,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cloud-native extensibility for future EHS enhancements.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;This ensured that the technical foundation remained adaptable as regulatory and sustainability requirements continued to evolve.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extensibility for Business and Regulatory Needs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Across all customers, extensibility was required mainly for country-specific regulations, additional validations, or customer-specific reporting. In most cases, these requirements could be fulfilled using Key User (In-App) Extensibility, without breaking the clean core. This allowed customers to remain upgrade-stable while still meeting local compliance needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1177011878"&gt;2.2 Pitfalls&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Despite the strong benefits, several recurring challenges also appeared in almost every project.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;System Landscape Complexity&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Hybrid landscapes naturally involve multiple systems: SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, SAP S/4HANA On-Premise, SAP MDG, SAP SuccessFactors, and SAP BTP / Integration Suite. Without clear integration ownership, defined interface responsibilities, and coordinated technical design, landscapes quickly became difficult to operate and monitor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dependency on Master Data Quality&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;EHS processes are extremely sensitive to master data issues. We repeatedly saw how missing materials, outdated organizational requirements, or incorrect functional locations immediately blocked emissions calculations, risk assessments, and incident follow-ups. High master data quality is mandatory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Development Where Standard Content Is Missing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;For some integration scenarios, especially Plant Maintenance integration for Functional Location and Equipment, custom iFlows were still required. This introduced additional development effort, higher testing effort, and long-term maintenance overhead.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitoring Challenges&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;End-to-end monitoring must cover:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud application logs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP S/4HANA On-Premise applications logs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Master Data Governance application logs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP SuccessFactors message monitoring&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Integration Suite / iFlow monitoring&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In several projects, missing monitoring initially led to delayed error detection and avoidable compliance risks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Value Mapping and Harmonization&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Incorrect or inconsistent value mappings between systems repeatedly caused replication failures. Early harmonization of organizational units, material types, equipment categories proved to be critical.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Validation of Services and Scope Items&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Missing API activations or scope item assignments (e.g., API_EQUIPMENT or API_FUNCTIONALLOCATION) frequently caused delays late in the project. Early validation of all required services became a key project success factor.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governance and Limitations of Extensibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Extensibility offers flexibility but without governance it quickly leads to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Diverging country solutions,&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Misaligned business logic&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;And long-term technical debt.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Additionally, Developer Extensibility is still limited to released APIs and BAdIs, which means that not every requirement can be solved purely with custom logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-980498373"&gt;2.3 Summary of Benefits &amp;amp; Pitfalls&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;A successful EHS Public Cloud implementation balances the strengths of standardized integration content and clean-core extensibility with disciplined data governance and architectural planning. Organizations that manage this balance effectively can unlock the full potential of SAP EHS – enabling safe, compliant, and scalable EHS operations across the enterprise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-654902149"&gt;3. Outlook&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Based on what we observe across current customer projects and SAP’s latest roadmap updates, SAP EHS in the Public Cloud is clearly evolving from a standalone compliance solution toward a central digital backbone for safety, risk, and environmental governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Many customers are already productive with core EHS scenarios today. At the same time, the functional scope continues to expand with each Public Cloud release. We see a strong move toward more standardized business content, broader regulatory coverage, and deeper support for environmental and sustainability-driven processes. As a result, future implementations will increasingly rely on configuration rather than custom development which significantly reduces implementation and upgrade effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Extensibility will nevertheless remain a key success factor. From our project experience, SAP is steadily increasing both the number and the quality of released APIs and cloud-compliant BAdIs. This allows customers to address local regulatory requirements and&amp;nbsp; compliant-specific validation logic in a clean-core compatible way. Especially Key User Extensibility is becoming more powerful, enabling business-driven adjustments without technical development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In parallel, SAP BTP is gaining further importance for advanced EHS use cases. While this blog series focused on On-Stack Extensibility, we already see growing demand for advanced analytics and dashboards, cross-system workflow automation, and IoT-based hazard detection and emissions monitoring. These scenarios clearly go beyond standard transactional processing and position SAP BTP as a natural complement to SAP EHS in complex enterprise landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Another major trend we observe is the increasing convergence of EHS and sustainability. Environmental compliance, emissions management, and sustainability reporting are becoming tightly connected. From a solution perspective, this strengthens the integration between SAP EHS, SAP Sustainability Footprint Management, and SAP Sustainability Control Tower. Customers will benefit from more consistent emissions data, integrated compliance reporting, and harmonized master data across production, procurement, and asset management.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;For customers, these developments reinforce one central message from our project work: Early architectural discipline pays off. Organizations that invest early in clean-core principles, standardized integration content, high master data quality, and clear extensibility governance are best positioned to benefit from future SAP innovations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-458388644"&gt;4.

Manual processes or disconnected systems can quickly lead to delays, mistakes, and unnecessary risks.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA for Product Compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt; and its &lt;STRONG&gt;Dangerous Goods Management&lt;/STRONG&gt; capabilities can close this gap. By simplifying and automating dangerous goods processes instead of relying on spreadsheets or outdated information, companies can handle their dangerous goods confidently and efficiently without slowing down their operations. Product Compliance comes with embedded regulatory content like UN classifications, hazard labels, shipping names, and transport permissions. So, with that, products can be classified correctly and handled safely throughout the entire supply chain.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What for me really stands out is the integration into everyday business processes. The system automatically calculates and checks transport permissions and flags missing or incomplete classification data. This stops non-compliant shipments before the products leave the warehouse. With built-in analytics, teams can gain a clear overview of regulatory requirements, which makes it much easier to act proactively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What the video is about:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How SAP S/4HANA simplifies classification and global transport management for dangerous goods&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How embedded regulatory content supports safety and compliance&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How automated checks and documentation reduce errors, delays, and manual work&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;How analytics provide transparency across the supply chain&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This topic is specially close to me because safety and compliance belong together. When they’re built into daily processes and supported by automation, they don’t slow teams down. They actually make work easier while reducing risks and building trust across the organization and beyond.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://sapvideo.cfapps.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_9g0ierok" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;SAP Video - In brief: SAP Product Compliance - Dangerous Goods&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watch the video to see how SAP S/4HANA for Product Compliance can help your organization handle dangerous goods safely and turn regulatory requirements into a real advantage.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This blog post was co-authored with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2174476"&gt;@Cielo_SanabriaRuiz&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1787449"&gt;@Sebastian1611&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sustainability is no longer just about carbon emissions - it’s about understanding the full environmental impact of business operations along the value chain. With the &lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2025/10/next-phase-sap-sustainability-footprint-management-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;next phase of SAP Sustainability Footprint Management&lt;/A&gt;, the solution expands from a pure carbon tool to a broader environmental footprint platform: In addition to detailed analysis of greenhouse gas emissions – including fossil, biogenic, and removed emissions – you can now calculate and analyze your organization’s impact across a wider range of areas, such as land use&amp;nbsp;, energy, waste, and resource depletion. This allows you to meet diverse reporting standards and drive operational decisions beyond decarbonization alone.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog post, we’ll provide you an introduction into the topic and a guided walk-through of the implementation process for multi-impact categories in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management. You’ll see how to configure your system, manage the relevant data, and run calculations so you can unlock richer, decision-ready sustainability insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;ul =""&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId-1767330022"&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId-588248992"&gt;Configure and Calculate Footprints for Multi-Impact Categories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:30px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId-520818206"&gt;Manage Source Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:30px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId-324304701"&gt;Manage Footprint Settings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:30px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId-127791196"&gt;Manage Emission Factors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:30px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId--143953678"&gt;Model Footprint Parameters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:30px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId--340467183"&gt;Manage Periodic Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:30px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId--536980688"&gt;Manage Footprint Calculations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:30px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId--733494193"&gt;Analyze Footprints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:30px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId--930007698"&gt;Communicate Footprints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId--833118196"&gt;Enhancements to APIs in Business Accelerator Hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left:15px; margin-bottom:1px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/supply-chain-management-blog-posts-by-sap/deep-dive-multi-impact-categories-in-sap-sustainability-footprint/ba-p/14291481#toc-hId--1029631701"&gt;Map Calculation Results to Reporting Standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1767330022"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1828981955"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What has changed&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since its initial release, SAP Sustainability Footprint Management has focused on calculating accurate product and corporate carbon footprints based on actual business data from SAP ERP and other sources. With the latest updates, this calculation engine now covers additional environmental impact categories so that you can monitor a wider range of environmental pressures using the same data foundation, governance model, and auditability:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Impact Categories in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352958iC32844EC1D7CC1A9/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SFM Impact Categories.png" alt="Impact Categories in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Impact Categories in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1632468450"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What multi-impact categories mean&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;Multi-impact categories in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management represent separate “lenses” on how business activities put pressure on different parts of the Earth system, all calculated on the same data foundation. This aligns well with the &lt;A href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;planetary boundaries concept&lt;/A&gt;, where climate change is only one boundary among several others such as biosphere integrity, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows that together define a safe operating space for humanity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of focusing on a single metric like carbon, multi‑impact categories let you translate your operational data into a set of environmental pressure indicators that mirror those planetary boundaries dimensions. In practice, this means that for every relevant activity or product, you can see not only its contribution to climate change but also how it stresses other Earth-system limits, helping you understand whether improvements in one area inadvertently push another boundary closer to its threshold.​ By structuring these indicators as configurable categories in the footprint model, SAP Sustainability Footprint Management becomes a bridge between planetary science and enterprise data, turning abstract boundary concepts into concrete KPIs based on your ERP data.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1435954945"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Why this matters for reporting&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;By going beyond carbon, you can align one consistent footprint dataset with multiple regulatory and voluntary frameworks, including emerging requirements from the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) or Science-Based Targets Initiative’s Forests, Land and Agriculture (SBTi FLAG) guidance, that increasingly demand broader environmental indicators. This reduces the need for parallel tools and spreadsheet workarounds, and helps sustainability, finance, and controlling teams work from synchronized, audit-ready numbers when preparing disclosures and customer requests.​&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A structured multi-impact model also strengthens the credibility of reported data, because the same calculation logic and master data serve both internal and external views. That consistency is crucial when environmental performance becomes a criterion in financing, procurement, and customer negotiations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1239441440"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Why this matters for decisions&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;When multi-impact indicators sit next to financial and operational KPIs, sustainability data moves from a separate reporting stream into the core of how you evaluate trade-offs and investment cases. This richer impact picture helps identify where reducing environmental pressure also boosts efficiency, resilience, and brand value, and where hidden risks accumulate if planetary boundaries are ignored.​&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this way, multi-impact categories support a shift from compliance-driven reporting to performance-driven steering, where sustainability becomes a dimension of competitiveness and innovation. These updates are a concrete step in SAP’s broader vision to transform sustainability data into a catalyst for long-term business value rather than a pure cost of doing business.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1042927935"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How one calculation serves many requirements&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;In SAP Sustainability Footprint Management, the integration and calculation setup stays exactly the same as before: You still reuse your ERP data, automate activity data collection, map to imported or pre-delivered emission factors, and run one centralized footprint calculation. The difference is that this familiar approach now delivers additional impact categories and result views, so the same activity data and methods can serve a growing list of corporate and product-level requirements without extra integration projects or parallel calculation logic.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Footprint Calculation Concept in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352653iB9CB5521E37A4BFB/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Multi Impact Overview.png" alt="Footprint Calculation Concept in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Footprint Calculation Concept in SAP Sustainability Footprint Management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-588248992"&gt;Configure and Calculate Footprints for Multi-Impact Categories&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The overall workflow remains similar to a standard carbon footprint calculation, but with crucial distinctions in steps where you specify and assign your desired impact categories and their corresponding factors:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Source Data:&amp;nbsp;Prepare foundational data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Footprint Settings:&amp;nbsp;Configure how footprints are calculated, including impact categories.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Emission Factors:&amp;nbsp;Define impact factors for all chosen categories and link them to purchased products.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Model Footprint Parameters:&amp;nbsp;Refine specific calculation models (e.g., energy flow, allocations).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Periodic Data:&amp;nbsp;Input business transactional data for the calculation period.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Manage Footprint Calculations:&amp;nbsp;Execute the footprint calculation across all selected impact categories.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Analyze Footprints:&amp;nbsp;Review and analyze on the multi-category results on different aggregation levels.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Communicate Footprints: Send your calculated environmental footprints to other applications.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-520818206"&gt;Manage Source Data&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The foundational master data required for environmental impact calculations is uploaded using the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Import Master Data&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; application. There are no changes to this app, for details see: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-import-master-data-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Import Master Data&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-324304701"&gt;Manage Footprint Settings&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To tailor the calculation process, select your desired configuration variant using the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Calculation Variants&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app. You can either opt for the &lt;EM&gt;DEFAULT&lt;/EM&gt; variant or configure a new one. Calculation variants define various parameters, such as allocation rules and Scope 2 calculation methods, which are fundamental to the overall footprint calculation. It is important to understand how these settings influence the results across&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;selected impact categories to ensure consistency and accuracy. See &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-manage-calculation-variants-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Calculation Variants&lt;/A&gt; for more information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Next, go to the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Footprint Inventory&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Scopes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; app to define the boundaries and specific impact categories to be assessed in your environmental footprint calculation. This is a critical step when expanding beyond pure product carbon footprints (PCFs) and corporate carbon footprints (CCFs). When creating a footprint inventory scope, you can select up to ten impact categories for a single scope, including &lt;EM&gt;Climate Change&lt;/EM&gt; which is always mandatory. If you enable the &lt;EM&gt;Accept Missing Emission Factors&lt;/EM&gt; attribute for an impact category, any entities lacking an emission factor for that category will be excluded from its specific calculation. This attribute can be enabled for each impact category individually. For details, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-manage-footprint-inventory-scopes-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Footprint Inventory Scopes&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Manage Inventory Scope" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352797i0F92EC66CED89037/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Inventory Scope.png" alt="Manage Inventory Scope" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Manage Inventory Scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-127791196"&gt;Manage Emission Factors&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To calculate footprints for your desired Impact Categories, you must provide corresponding emission and/or impact factors. SAP Sustainability Footprint Management allows you to utilize pre-delivered emission factor data packages, or you can import your own data via the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Emission Factors&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app. This is a key area where the process expands significantly when moving beyond a single CO2e factor. The key considerations for managing emission factors for multiple impact categories are the following:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For each impact category you wish to assess, a specific impact factor is required. Therefore, when populating either the &lt;EM&gt;LCA&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;Simple Template&lt;/EM&gt;, you must input a separate entry for each impact category. Although these factors might relate to the same product, energy source, or business activity, they are differentiated by their distinct &lt;EM&gt;Impact Category ID&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Impact factors other than &lt;EM&gt;Climate Change (CLCH)&lt;/EM&gt; must be added via &lt;EM&gt;Data Packages&lt;/EM&gt; and cannot be manually inserted into the &lt;EM&gt;Emission Factor Periods&lt;/EM&gt; in consuming apps such as &lt;EM&gt;Model Energy Flows&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Manage Waste Footprints&lt;/EM&gt;, or &lt;EM&gt;Manage Business Activities&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;For importing emission factors, both the simple template (version 3) and the LCA template (version 5) in the &lt;EM&gt;Manage Emission Factors&lt;/EM&gt; app have been enhanced to support multiple impact categories.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For details on maintaining emission factors data in the templates, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/emission-factors-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Emission Factors Data&lt;/A&gt;. Under &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/impact-categories?version=LATEST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Impact Categories&lt;/A&gt;, you find a table with all impact categories, including their IDs, dimensions, and indicators.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Manage Emission Factors" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352802i6DF548C52DCA8F66/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Emission Factors.png" alt="Manage Emission Factors" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Manage Emission Factors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After importing the relevant emission factors, you can move to the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Purchased Product Footprints&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app to map your imported products from your ERP system to the previously maintained emission factor datasets. Those must include data for the &lt;EM&gt;Climate Change&lt;/EM&gt; impact category and can&amp;nbsp;optionally&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;include emission data for additional ones. The mapping can be done manually or AI-assisted – with just one mapping, all available data for the impact categories is linked automatically. Clicking on a mapped dataset, provides you with an overview of all mapped content. See &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-manage-purchased-product-footprints-application-1e18e85502f145bd9ccfb71d59695e46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Purchased Product Footprints&lt;/A&gt; for more information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Manage Purchased Product Footprints" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352801i98AB0BFC0E8E80D5/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Purchased Product Footprints.png" alt="Manage Purchased Product Footprints" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Manage Purchased Product Footprints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similar to purchased products, the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Waste Footprints&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app enables you to manage the values used to calculate &lt;EM&gt;Climate Change&lt;/EM&gt; and&amp;nbsp;other environmental impacts&amp;nbsp;resulting from the treatment of a specific type of waste within a defined period. Those can also be entered manually or mapped to maintained emission factor datasets. For more details, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-manage-waste-footprints-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Waste Footprints&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, Business Activities allow you to calculate environmental impacts based on form-based data collection. In the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Business Activities&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app, you can create those business activities and map the corresponding emission factor. For each business activity, you can determine which GHG scope the activity relates to. Find all details under &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-manage-business-activities-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Business Activities&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--143953678"&gt;Model Footprint Parameters&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;When calculating impacts for energy-related and transport activities, the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Locations&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app allows you to manage relevant locations. Ensure all locations pertinent to your chosen impact categories are added. See &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/manage-locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Locations&lt;/A&gt; for more information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Model Energy Flows&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; application is crucial for managing energy consumption and its associated impacts. When creating &lt;EM&gt;Energy Sources&lt;/EM&gt; and their corresponding emission factor periods, you can now connect to emission factor datasets that include&amp;nbsp;impact categories beyond just &lt;EM&gt;Climate Change&lt;/EM&gt;. This means that the environmental impact of energy consumption, whether from electricity, fuel, or other sources, can now be assessed not only for its carbon footprint but also for its contribution to abiotic resource depletion or other selected impact categories, provided the relevant emission factors are assigned. While you can create a full energy flow model, including meter readings to allocate energy and emissions to locations, resources and manufactured products, you may also opt to create only the relevant &lt;EM&gt;Energy Sources&lt;/EM&gt; required for your Corporate Carbon Footprint calculations. In both cases, the periodic consumption values, and if enabled the corresponding meter readings, are entered later in a GHG Data Form via the &lt;EM&gt;Record GHG Data&lt;/EM&gt; app. For more information, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-model-energy-flows-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Model Energy Flows&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Manage Energy Source" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352806i4DD9EC50C7D6FE19/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Energy.png" alt="Manage Energy Source" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Manage Energy Source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For distributing environmental impacts from senders (e.g., &lt;EM&gt;Business Activities&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Facilities&lt;/EM&gt;, or &lt;EM&gt;Waste Types&lt;/EM&gt;) to receivers (e.g., &lt;EM&gt;Facilities&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Process Infrastructures&lt;/EM&gt;, or &lt;EM&gt;Products&lt;/EM&gt;), you can define &lt;EM&gt;Allocation Schemes&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;Allocation Rules&lt;/EM&gt; in the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Allocations&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app. A sender is selected and linked to one or multiple receivers. The allocation ratio determines which portion of the sender’s total impact (across&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;calculated impact categories) is allocated to each receiver. This ensures that the environmental impacts associated with, for example, a shared energy source are correctly attributed to the products or processes consuming that energy. Check &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-manage-allocations-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Allocations&lt;/A&gt; for all details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--340467183"&gt;Manage Periodic Data&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To calculate environmental impacts related to purchased goods and services, business transactions need to be imported from your ERP system via the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Import Business Transactions&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app. This includes data related to the movement of physical goods that are relevant for calculating product and corporate environmental impacts. Typical goods movement transactions that track the flow of products are: &lt;EM&gt;Opening Stock&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Goods Receipt from Supplier&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Goods Transfer&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Goods Issue and Receipt from Production&lt;/EM&gt;, and &lt;EM&gt;Internal Service Confirmation&lt;/EM&gt;. Periodic data will be imported within the periodic boundaries defined in the Footprint Inventory Scope. These transactions form the basis for actual activity data that will be multiplied by the impact factors across all selected impact categories.

You can enter activity values for each footprint inventory scope and period within these apps. While the apps are named with &lt;EM&gt;GHG&lt;/EM&gt;, they now support the collection of activity data that will be linked to emission factors for&amp;nbsp;all selected impact categories, not just greenhouse gases. For all details, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-manage-ghg-data-collections-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage GHG Data Collections&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-record-ghg-data-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Record GHG Data&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GHG Data Collection" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352967i36337B4FF2CFE783/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="GHG Data Collection.png" alt="GHG Data Collection" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;GHG Data Collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--536980688"&gt;Manage Footprint Calculations&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once all data is set up and provided in the preceding steps, the organizational environmental impact for the selected impact categories can be calculated. In the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Calculate Footprints&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app, maintain the necessary data, such as the &lt;EM&gt;Footprint Inventory Scope&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Calculation Variant&lt;/EM&gt;, and &lt;EM&gt;Period&lt;/EM&gt;. Before initiating the calculation, it’s crucial to check for data completeness to ensure accurate results across all chosen impact categories. The calculation engine will then process all assigned impact factors against the activity data. For more information, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-calculate-footprints-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Calculate Footprints&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To view the detailed results per impact category, navigate to the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Manage Footprint Results&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app or click &lt;EM&gt;Show Results&lt;/EM&gt; directly within the &lt;EM&gt;Calculate Footprints&lt;/EM&gt; app. You can then click on each calculated Footprint Item within the inventory to drill down into details. While the Sankey chart currently remains focused on &lt;EM&gt;Climate Change&lt;/EM&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;Footprint Information&lt;/EM&gt; section&amp;nbsp;now clearly displays the calculated impact categories per GHG scope (where applicable), along with the corresponding total footprint and footprint per unit for each impact category you selected. See &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-manage-footprint-results-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Manage Footprint Results&lt;/A&gt; for details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Manage Footprint Results" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352966i3368924695439E22/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Manage Results.png" alt="Manage Footprint Results" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Manage Footprint Results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--733494193"&gt;Analyze Footprints&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;For analyzing the calculated footprints, the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Footprint Overview&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app provides a high-level summary of your impact calculation results. While the initial general overview and dashboards emphasize the &lt;EM&gt;Climate Change&lt;/EM&gt; impact category, clicking on the respective dashboards allows you to navigate to more detailed analyses. See &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-footprint-overview-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Using the Footprint Overview Application&lt;/A&gt; for more information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Corporate Balance&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; app provides a consolidated view of your organization’s environmental performance. While it may not yet offer specific multi-impact-category features distinct from the &lt;EM&gt;Climate Change&lt;/EM&gt; balance, it serves as an overarching summary. For learning more about viewing organizational upstream and downstream emissions, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-corporate-balance-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Using the Corporate Balance Application&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Purchased Products&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; analytics app now allows you to display calculated footprints by impact category via a filter option. This enables a detailed understanding of the environmental burden associated with specific procured products across all selected impact categories, providing a richer perspective than just CO2e. For more information, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-purchased-goods-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Using the Purchased Products Application&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Purchased Product Footprints Analytics" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/352957i402434E960837306/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Analytics Purchased Products.png" alt="Purchased Product Footprints Analytics" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Purchased Product Footprints Analytics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Similarly, the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sold Products&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; analytics app offers a filter option to display the calculated footprints by impact category. This is crucial for understanding the cradle-to-gate (or other defined boundary) impacts of products your organization sells, reported across various environmental indicators. Find more details under &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-sold-goods-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Using the Sold Products Application&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Energy Consumers&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; analytics app has been enhanced to allow you to choose and display the calculated footprints by impact category through a filter option. This provides granular insights into the environmental impacts (e.g., &lt;EM&gt;Climate Change&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;Resource Depletion&lt;/EM&gt;) associated with energy consumption for specific entities within your organization. See &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sustainability-footprint-management/application-help-for-corporate-and-products/using-energy-consumers-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Using the Energy Consumers Application&lt;/A&gt; to learn more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finally, also the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Waste Generated in Operations&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; analytics app now includes a filter option, enabling you to display the calculated footprints by impact category. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of the environmental burden from internal waste management across different environmental dimensions.
