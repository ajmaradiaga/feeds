    <content>&lt;P&gt;Over the last months SAP has made several announcements related to making Joule free for customers. &amp;nbsp;In this article I will review the current status and share my thoughts on this topic and the opportunities for SAP channel partners.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;My take on SAP making Joule Base free:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There are real costs involved for SAP to run Joule Base for customer.&amp;nbsp; When users query Joule SAP leverages LLMs to deal with the quiry and this has costs for SAP.&amp;nbsp; SAP does not pass this on to users.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;But obviously, businesses don’t give away anything for free without a reason.&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, SAP has showed commitment to its statement that Joule will be the new UI of SAP solutions.&amp;nbsp; This is a strategic move for the future.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The core value and “crown jewel” of SAP is its automation of business processes, not the UI.&amp;nbsp; Making it easy and simple for customers to consume these core capabilities will make SAP’s core solutions more consumed and successful.&amp;nbsp; And that is where the important revenue streams for SAP are.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule is becoming more and more a platform.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes Joule is even called the AI OS of SAP.&amp;nbsp; Further, Joule and Joule agents also have the potential to leverage AI to integrate all the SAP solutions as needed, on the fly.&amp;nbsp; For many years people have said that&amp;nbsp; SAP solutions could be better integrated.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps Joule and Joule Agents will be a big step forward in this area?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule is becoming so central for SAP offerings and solutions that it makes sense to democratize it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What exactly do customers get for free?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customers get “Joule Base” for free.&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, this is pretty much the “classic” Joule we heard about when SAP launched Joule last year.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Till now, Joule was available for some LOB solutions, but with limitation on how many free “Joule requests” a user was granted. And initially, transactional pattern was not included in the free Joule Base launched at Sapphire this year. However, transactional pattern is now included and there is no limit to the free requests / usage by the user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With Joule Base users can leverage three types of activities (called Joule patterns):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Navigational:&lt;/STRONG&gt; ask a question in your own words related to what you want to do in the system and Joule will analyze your question together with LLMs and propose the best SAP app / screen for you to leverage.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Is these capabilities valuable for a user?&amp;nbsp; If a user always does the same activities and is an expert in the system, this might have limited value.&amp;nbsp; But if a user complain that SAP is difficult to work with this can absolutely help.&amp;nbsp; Also, for new users and existing users needing to do something new in the system the capabilities (together with informational pattern) can be very useful.&amp;nbsp; Finally, an interesting perspective from a channel partner always positioning Joule to customers and prospects: with the new generation of people joining the workforce, tools like Joule will become more and more important.&amp;nbsp; The new generation of workers expect to be able to get help from the systems they are supposed to use and master, instead of learning everything upfront.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Informational:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt; user can ask a question about how the SAP system works and Joule will leverage SAP help portal and the LLMs to provide an answer: the relevant sections from the help portal will be collected, passed on to the LLM with the appropriate prompt, and the LLM will make a summary for the specific question of the user.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For example, &lt;EM&gt;“w&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;hat is the dif&lt;/EM&gt;fere&lt;EM&gt;nce between a service order and a service contract”.&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Other examples can be questions about how certain accounting principles works in SAP.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Further, a very interesting opportunity for customers is to extend this capability with information about their own work instructions, policies etc as part of document grounding.&amp;nbsp; In my opinion, the costing of SAP document grounding is very appealing for smaller customers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transactional:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt; While “navigational” and “informational” patterns are high level &amp;amp; general information about the SAP solution, transactional action is more about the customer specific business data in the system. Joule can retrieve data about specific business data information.&amp;nbsp; Example: “&lt;SPAN&gt;Show prices for sales organization&amp;nbsp;1710&amp;nbsp;that are due to expire before December 31, 2025”.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;Joule can even change data in the system.&amp;nbsp; Instead of going to a specific app to do an action, a user can write in their own works instruction for joule to change the data.&amp;nbsp; For example: &lt;SPAN&gt;“Extend the valid-to dates by one week” (Joule will know you refer to the previous question about sales prices). &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In my opinion, these capabilities can be valuable but are pretty “light” in terms of AI.&amp;nbsp; SAP Business AI can also do much more sophisticated &amp;amp; generative transactional actions in the system, but those activities have much higher run costs and is part of Premium AI offerings for which customers must pay extra.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="finn_backer_1-1757426268852.png" style="width: 1214px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311736i462FBF0112A1C25F/image-dimensions/1214x682/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="1214" height="682" role="button" title="finn_backer_1-1757426268852.png" alt="finn_backer_1-1757426268852.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Check out more on the &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/assets/partnership/dgl/72/01/SAP1207201.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI commercialization on PE Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule runs on SAP BTP.&amp;nbsp; To run Joule Base, a customer thus needs to have an SAP BTP account. If a customer does not have an BTP account, they will get the needed entitlements for free. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What are my opportunities as reseller when Joule base is free?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If Joule Base is free, there is nothing to resell, right?&amp;nbsp; So, what is in it for resellers?&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The topic is much more strategic than this.&amp;nbsp; SAP’s channel partners don’t only “resell stuff”, they also take care of customers to ensure they get the most out of their SAP system, that customers are happy about their SAP system, order more services from the partner and keep renewing their SAP subscriptions (for which partner also get paid).&amp;nbsp; AI is probably the biggest technology trend at the moment, and I think it is great that channel partners can tell their customers that SAP has invested a lot in R&amp;amp;D to ensure their systems and investment stay up to date with technology. &amp;nbsp;My recommendation to resellers is to position Joule Base part of what they get for their subscription payments and something which helps protect their investment in their SAP system. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As partner, you can obviously do services around advising and implementing Joule Base for the customer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And there are a lot of opportunities to do additional AI work for customers on top of Joule Base, including reselling AI Units which are needed to activate the Joule Premium packages.&amp;nbsp; And partners can leverage Joule Base to trigger ideas at customers for customer specific AI capabilities, that you as partner can develop.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What does customers NOT get with Joule Base?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are basically three categories of capabilities customers don’t get and must pay extra for if they want to use them:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Premium PUPM packages&lt;/STRONG&gt;..&amp;nbsp; There are many deep/niche AI embedded capabilities which is only available in via Joule Premium packages.&amp;nbsp; Examples are&amp;nbsp; &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://platformx-ad17b8dc3.dispatcher.hana.ondemand.com/ai-feature/864e421f-e2dd-4f84-9aad-ea57294f75fd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Financial business insight&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; for ERP Cloud, &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://platformx-ad17b8dc3.dispatcher.hana.ondemand.com/ai-feature/231d6a91-c550-4bca-8de7-b903cb7e7f5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Performance Goal creation&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; in SuccessFactors and &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://platformx-ad17b8dc3.dispatcher.hana.ondemand.com/ai-feature/05a916d0-170e-4be2-b60a-a3bc388d383b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;E-mail draft recommender&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; for Service Cloud V2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; These capabilities go much deeper than Joule transactional capabilities and consume significant more LLM capacity. &amp;nbsp;Thus, these are charged separately.&amp;nbsp; These functionalities are triggeed by users and thus included in the new Per User Per Month (PUPM) packages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Transactional Capabilities. &lt;/STRONG&gt;There are some AI powered capabilities not triggered by users, but by “the system”.&amp;nbsp; These capabilities are therefore priced based on a transactional metering.&amp;nbsp; Example of this is "Document Grounding": the upfront indexing of customer specific documents so that they can be leveraged by users (free) via joule base informational pattern later.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analytical Pattern:&lt;/STRONG&gt; There is a fourth Joule pattern only available in Joule Premium packages, and that is “Analytical Pattern”; the capability for Joule to respond to user prompts about analytical analysis of their SAP data.&amp;nbsp; Note: customers also need to run SAP Analytic Cloud (SAC) for this to work.&amp;nbsp; In general, this pattern has been developed by the central Joule team, but most of the LOB product teams still need to make the connection between Joule, LOB solution and SAC. So this pattern is not available yet for most LOB solutions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What does a customer need to do to get Joule base for free?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While it is free, Joule Base is not automatically available for all customers.&amp;nbsp; The reason is there are specific AI terms and conditions which SAP wants customers to sign before they get access to Joule. &amp;nbsp;“Old” customers don’t have these T&amp;amp;C's in their contract. &amp;nbsp;The easiest way for customers to get Joule Base is to “purchase ”&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/joule-base-entitlement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Base on the SAP store&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; (at a cost of 0,00).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This will trigger the signing of the T&amp;amp;Cs and assignment of the entitlements in the customer’s system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Can I as partner also get Joule Base for free for my TDD environment?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For ERP Cloud, SuccessFactors, IBP and Digital Manufacturing, &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/products/sbai/about/test_demo.html?#section-1-accordion-panel-section-widewidgets-accordionitem_159685_1097080609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;get it here&lt;/A&gt; for free for your LOB TDD system&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There is no TDD for ERP Cloud Private so there is also no Joule on TDD either.&amp;nbsp; However, this is planned to change in Q4 2025, so stay tuned.&amp;nbsp; For CX, Joule is not in GA yet but expected to come later this year, also for TDD.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are interested in more details, check out these documents:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/assets/solutions/dgl/22/66/SAP1202266.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ERP Cloud&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/b4tWVEb?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1222807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ERP Cloud Private&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/wMygCcK?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1204113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SuccessFactors&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/hRjJRhB?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1204116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Customer Experience&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

If shipping times are in jeopardy, the warehouse system is then expected to evaluate if an optimized resource allocation could pro-actively solve any potential delays. When a more optimal usage of the available resources is found, resources should automatically be directed to the critical areas. Being able to take action proactively is of the essence, because we do not want to only take action when we are already in delay.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The following is an example of an AI-driven, Joule enabled Application that can accomplish the above outlined requirements and activities supported by AI. The Application leverages the embedded AI in the EWM Private Cloud Edition S/4 HANA 2023 FPS03 release and the Joule Studio available in SAP Build.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757445553011.png" style="width: 849px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311902i8C85C1316F32C558/image-dimensions/849x482/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="849" height="482" role="button" title="Tim_Dalm_0-1757445553011.png" alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757445553011.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Architecture of the Application looks as follows:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757444996110.png" style="width: 685px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/311900i8856978AA3FE5860/image-dimensions/685x445/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="685" height="445" role="button" title="Tim_Dalm_0-1757444996110.png" alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757444996110.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-based Warehouse Workload Visibility&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the current version of the Application, the expected workloads of picking and packing operations are calculated leveraging the embedded AI capabilities in SAP EWM, which are then displayed in the UI5 Application (see in the example below):&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757511697370.png" style="width: 747px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312397iC01BCF8B5BC170A8/image-dimensions/747x295/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="747" height="295" role="button" title="Tim_Dalm_0-1757511697370.png" alt="Tim_Dalm_0-1757511697370.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is also clearly visible in which Activity Area the workload is currently exceeding the planned Resource capacity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Application then further allows a manual simulation of adding or removing Resources to evaluate the impact in a given activity area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The fully "automatic rebalancing" function evaluates whether it is possible to optimize the resource allocation to the different areas, considering the allowed resource types in an Activity Area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If an optimized resource allocation is possible, the warehouse operations manager, can accept these changes and the resources will be reassigned in the EWM system so that they will receive workload to execute from the new area.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule-enabled with custom EWM Joule Skills&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Further more the current version of the Application provides Joule support for Warehouse Operations Management with the following &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Skills&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Skill 1:&amp;nbsp;Current Workload Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Provide a comprehensive analysis of the current workload associated with picking and packing operations, considering the current resource allocation across different warehouse areas, as well as dependent scheduling of packing activities.&lt;BR /&gt;- &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Skill 2: Provide&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Optimized Resource Allocation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Simulate an optimal workforce allocation strategy to mitigate bottlenecks and criticalities within the warehouse operations, to avoid shipping delays.&lt;BR /&gt;- &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Skill 3:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Accept Optimized Resource Allocation&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Accept the optimization results and reassign the resources in EWM to the new areas.&amp;nbsp;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;On average, an SAP ABAP developer spends approximately 2 hours understanding the functional specification before beginning the coding process. Depending on the requirement, complexity, and the developer’s experience, he may take a day or two or more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Over the years, every SAP customer has invested significant effort in custom developments, extensions, testing, and optimizing the code. Imagine if the developer is on vacation or has transitioned to a different project; in such cases, new code changes or updates become a considerable challenge for a new developer to manage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;From my years of SAP ABAP development experience, I have worked on several internal and customer requirements with few to many challenges understanding the code. With the introduction of AI in the current trend, SAP has been one of the front-runners in introducing AI capabilities. Let me take this opportunity to introduce you to &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule for Developers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; (in short J4D)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;“Joule&lt;SPAN&gt;”&lt;/SPAN&gt; is the SAP copilot that ABAP developers need for their development tasks. It is uniquely trained on SAP data and processes. Joule's ABAP developer capabilities combine all the features to support full-stack development with ABAP Cloud. For instance, Joule provides real-time explanations of development objects, streamlining learning and finding answers to questions. Joule is fully integrated in the ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse and provides accurate information about currently opened development objects or marked lines of code. Joule is also able to predict and generate subsequent lines of code based on comments, or the code you're typing. The Joule code prediction takes the ABAP language version of your selected development object into account and suggests ABAP code that fits the respective language version context. Joule can generate ABAP cloud development scenarios&lt;SPAN&gt;,&lt;/SPAN&gt; including all required development objects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Joule for ABAP Developers:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The AI capabilities for ABAP are designed to enhance developer productivity by delivering new generative AI-powered assistance for frequent developer tasks. The ABAP AI capabilities utilize a purpose-built large language model (LLM) trained on &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;250 million lines&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; of ABAP code&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; to deliver the most precise, contextual results for ABAP workloads.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule can understand SAP development framework intricacies, anticipate developers’ needs, offer intelligent suggestions, and automate repetitive, mundane tasks like documentation and sample data generation. It can enable developers across pro-code and automation projects to be more productive, creative, and proficient in accelerating apps or extensions for business applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Predictive code completion based on context, comments, and project heuristics&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Code explanations of core data services (CDS) view entities, classes, interfaces, and functional modules&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-powered assistance for documentation, best practices, and new concepts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Boost developer productivity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is a glimpse of all the Joule for Developers(J4D) capabilities that it offers:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="YASHLAL_55-1756989254023.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/309244iD12A01E5AF7391AA/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="YASHLAL_55-1756989254023.png" alt="YASHLAL_55-1756989254023.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What license is required?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;J4D is a part of SAP AI Unit (8019164), - the new Per User Per Month (PUPM&lt;SPAN&gt;)&lt;/SPAN&gt; license model released by SAP for all requirements. However, we also have a limited offer with Joule for Developers (8019124) limited promotion, which is valid only until Q2 '2026.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Typically, an SAP ABAP developer spends around two hours analyzing the functional specifications before diving into the actual coding. However, this time can vary significantly depending on the complexity of the requirement and the developer’s level of experience—ranging from a single day to several.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Over time, SAP customers have heavily invested in custom development, system enhancements, rigorous testing, and code optimization. This leads to a common challenge: when a developer goes on leave or transitions to another project, understanding and maintaining their code can become a daunting task for someone new.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Drawing from my own experience in SAP ABAP development, I’ve frequently encountered difficulties in interpreting legacy code—whether developed internally or for customers. In today's AI-driven landscape, SAP has taken bold steps to integrate artificial intelligence into its development ecosystem. One such innovation is &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule for Developers (J4D)&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt; is more than just a digital assistant—it’s an AI copilot specifically designed to support ABAP developers. What sets Joule apart is that it's trained on SAP-specific data and processes, making it deeply contextual. It assists throughout the full-stack ABAP Cloud development lifecycle, offering features like real-time explanations of development objects, intuitive code insights, and instant answers to development-related queries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Integrated directly into the ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse, Joule offers context-aware support for open development objects and selected lines of code. It also predicts and generates ABAP code in real-time based on your comments or what you’re typing. Importantly, it respects the language version of your development environment, ensuring that the suggestions align with the appropriate ABAP standards.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With Joule, developers can also generate complete ABAP Cloud development scenarios, including all necessary objects—significantly accelerating development and reducing the onboarding curve for new developers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Joule for ABAP Developers:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The AI capabilities for ABAP are designed to enhance developer productivity by delivering new generative AI-powered assistance for frequent developer tasks. The ABAP AI capabilities utilize a purpose-built large language model (LLM) trained on &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;250 million lines of ABAP code&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; to deliver the most precise, contextual results for ABAP workloads.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benefits?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule can understand SAP development framework intricacies, anticipate developers’ needs, offer intelligent suggestions, and automate repetitive, mundane tasks like documentation and sample data generation. It can enable developers across pro-code and automation projects to be more productive, creative, and proficient in accelerating apps or extensions for business applications.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Predictive code completion based on context, comments, and project heuristics&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Code explanations of core data services (CDS) view entities, classes, interfaces, and functional modules&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI-powered assistance for documentation, best practices, and new concepts&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Boost developer productivity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="YASHLAL_0-1757281411480.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/310638i6BEF6019BFF1813B/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="YASHLAL_0-1757281411480.png" alt="YASHLAL_0-1757281411480.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What license is required?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The ABAP AI revolution just got a massive functionality upgrade and stays FREE OF CHARGE for another year&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Remember John, our seasoned ABAP developer who discovered the power of Joule for AI-assisted coding? His journey has taken an incredible turn. What started as relief from "quick questions" and real-time assistance has evolved into something he never imagined possible – building entire applications and transforming legacy systems through conversation in minutes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;John's incredible journey is about to accelerate even further with game-changing news:&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Developers remains FREE OF CHARGE for another year&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;– the promotion has been extended with no commercial barriers, allowing every customer and partner to benefit from AI-driven development through material numbers 8019124 (customers) and 8019541 (TDD partners). This offer is now available not only for the BTP ABAP environments (Steampunk) and SAP Cloud ERP Public, but also to our SAP Cloud ERP Private customers using the latest 2025 release version. For a deep dive in more commercial details see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/abap-ai-chapter-2/ba-p/14210568" target="_blank"&gt;ABAP AI - Chapter 2&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;blog written by my colleague&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/179726"&gt;@AlexanderRother&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;See John's ABAP AI complete evolution with 2505, 2508 and 2025 ABAP releases:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Game-Changer: ABAP Cloud Application Generation&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Intelligent Business Logic with RAP Business Logic Prediction&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Seamless Integration with OData Consumption&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Enhanced Extensibility with Extensibility AI Assistant&amp;nbsp;for SAP Cloud ERP Public&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Migration Revolution: Custom Code Migration AI Assistant&amp;nbsp;for SAP Cloud ERP Private 2025&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1760086936"&gt;The Game-Changer: ABAP Cloud Application Generation&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;John's latest project required a library application with multiple entities. Opening his package in ADT, he right-clicks and selects "Generate ABAP Repository Objects." The new&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OData UI Service from Scratch Wizard with Joule Chat&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;appears.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"Create a library application with entities for branches, book stock, users and borrowing information. Generate the appropriate fields which fit the business case for the entities." John prompts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SimonaM_0-1757699149723.png" style="width: 831px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313657iF75C055449D3BA74/image-dimensions/831x489?v=v2" width="831" height="489" role="button" title="SimonaM_0-1757699149723.png" alt="SimonaM_0-1757699149723.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Within seconds, Joule responds with a comprehensive proposal including all entities, fields, and relationships. One click on "Accept" and the wizard auto-populates all configuration fields. Minutes later, John has a complete, runnable RAP application with data model, behavior definitions, service bindings, and OData services ready for UI consumption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1563573431"&gt;Intelligent Business Logic with RAP Business Logic Prediction&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;But the magic doesn't stop at application generation. John's application needs sophisticated business logic – validations for booking dates, automatic stock calculations, and borrowing permission determinations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Navigating to his behavior implementation class, John finds empty method stubs for his determinations and validations. The&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;RAP Predict Business Logic&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;capability kicks in, understanding the entity structure, field relationships, and business context to generate complete validation logic within the method implementation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SimonaM_2-1757699553027.png" style="width: 671px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313659i2E91AAAC0E2D0475/image-dimensions/671x255?v=v2" width="671" height="255" role="button" title="SimonaM_2-1757699553027.png" alt="SimonaM_2-1757699553027.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;"It's not just generating code," John marvels. "It's understanding the business context and implementing proper RAP patterns automatically."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1367059926"&gt;Seamless Integration with OData Consumption&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When John needs to integrate with external booking services, he opens his service consumption model and starts the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule chat&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;with the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;/consume&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;slash command. The&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;OData consumption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;capability generates complete, ready-to-use ABAP code for consuming OData calls via the OData Client Proxy, tailored to his specific service model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SimonaM_5-1757699897856.png" style="width: 909px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313662iC303D01AD9C0D39A/image-dimensions/909x507?v=v2" width="909" height="507" role="button" title="SimonaM_5-1757699897856.png" alt="SimonaM_5-1757699897856.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;What used to take hours of documentation reading now happens in seconds with Joule providing example prompts and OData request generation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1170546421"&gt;Enhanced Extensibility with Extensibility AI Assistant for SAP Cloud ERP Public&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As business requirements evolve, the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Extensibility AI Assistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;guides John through adding custom fields for regulatory compliance. It assists him in:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Creating Custom Fields&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for borrowing information&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finding Business Contexts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for the right extension points&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enabling Usages&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;where custom fields can be exposed in UIs, APIs, and analytical views&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enabling Business Scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for data flow between business objects&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finding Value Help Views&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;for code list-based custom fields&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finding BAdIs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;based on natural language input&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SimonaM_6-1757700405040.png" style="width: 841px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/313665i86F9A9FF94CFD78E/image-dimensions/841x547?v=v2" width="841" height="547" role="button" title="SimonaM_6-1757700405040.png" alt="SimonaM_6-1757700405040.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-974032916"&gt;The Migration Revolution: Custom Code Migration AI Assistant&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;for SAP Cloud ERP Private 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;With the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2025 release&lt;/STRONG&gt;, John faces his organization's biggest challenge: migrating 15 years of custom ECC code to SAP ERP Cloud Private 2025. The&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Custom Code Migration AI Assistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;will&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;transforms this experience (on October 2025 planned release).&amp;nbsp; These use cases are currently not available on the older releases, however the use cases delivered on 2025 versions will be soon provided also as part of the&lt;STRONG&gt; Custom Code Migration Application&lt;/STRONG&gt; which is a standalone BTP ABAP environment (Steampunk) application &lt;STRONG&gt;which can connect freely to any ERP OnPrem or Cloud system to support RISE migrations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Using the Explain Capability&lt;/STRONG&gt;: "Explain this legacy report," John types, selecting a 500-line ABAP program. The&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Explain capability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;provides detailed explanations of the ABAP program, breaking down complex concepts with support for ABAP classes, ABAP programs, and CDS artifacts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Explain ATC Findings Capability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: When running ATC checks with S/4HANA readiness variants, John uses the&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Explain ATC Findings capability&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;on his S/4HANA readiness findings. This capability provides detailed explanations and step by step resolution proposal on ATC findings from check variants for SAP S/4HANA Readiness, specifically for:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;S/4HANA: Field Length Extensions,&amp;nbsp;S/4HANA: Search for Database Operations and&amp;nbsp;S/4HANA: Search for Usages and Simplified Objects.

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Esta semana reunimos puntos que atraviesan las prioridades de CIOs que buscan control y eficiencia, arquitectos SAP que evalúan integraciones híbridas, equipos Basis preocupados por estabilidad y seguridad, y consultores que necesitan entregar valor más rápido. Verás novedades de IA práctica, avances en data &amp;amp; analytics, casos de automatización y reflexiones sobre cómo convertir complejidad en resultados tangibles.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP AI Core y modelos propios en BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt; Las empresas ya pueden entrenar y desplegar sus propios modelos en SAP AI Core con integración nativa a datos SAP. Esto abre la puerta a IA especializada en cada industria, pero plantea un dilema: ¿cómo equilibrar innovación con compliance? Una aseguradora podría entrenar un modelo para detección de fraudes, pero ¿qué pasa si no logra explicabilidad suficiente? La promesa es grande, el riesgo también.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Tu organización está lista para invertir en IA propia o preferís modelos preentrenados de SAP y partners?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Nuevo release de SAP Integration Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt; La suite incorpora conectores preconfigurados para Salesforce, Workday y ServiceNow, simplificando arquitecturas híbridas. El beneficio es velocidad en despliegues, pero la realidad es que muchas empresas ya tienen middleware paralelo. Un retail puede ver valor en unificar todo en BTP, pero el costo de “migrar lo viejo” nunca es trivial.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Vale la pena consolidar integraciones en una sola plataforma o es mejor convivir con múltiples soluciones?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/what-s-new-for-sap-integration-suite-june-amp-july-2024/ba-p/13787789" target="_blank"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;DataSphere y federación en tiempo real&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP Datasphere suma capacidades para federar datos en vivo desde Snowflake y BigQuery, sin replicación masiva. Esto cambia el juego: menos ETL, más velocidad. Una minera podría consultar KPIs financieros y de producción en un único dashboard, pero la latencia y la calidad de metadatos pueden ser talón de Aquiles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Creés que el futuro es federar datos en vivo o seguir apostando a replicar en un único repositorio?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://learning.sap.com/courses/exploring-sap-datasphere/introducing-sap-datasphere-integration-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Developers: IA gratis hasta 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt; El programa permite a los desarrolladores usar capacidades de IA generativa dentro de SAP Build Code, Build Apps, Process Automation y entornos ABAP sin costo hasta septiembre de 2026. Esto acelera la creación de aplicaciones, automatiza procesos y mejora la productividad, pero también plantea un reto: ¿cómo asegurar que los equipos realmente adopten la herramienta y no quede como “demo eterna”? Imaginemos un equipo de manufactura que genera código para integrarse con sensores IoT en minutos, pero sin estrategia de adopción puede terminar en pilotos aislados sin impacto real.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿En tu empresa ya están explorando Joule for Developers o aún se percibe como una prueba de laboratorio sin plan de escalamiento?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7371164704255328256/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Gestión de identidades con CIS: más allá del SSO&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP Cloud Identity Services ya no es solo un proveedor de inicio de sesión único: hoy permite aplicar MFA (autenticación multifactor), gestionar identidades externas y controlar accesos en entornos híbridos. El beneficio es claro: menos riesgos de seguridad y más trazabilidad. Pero el desafío aparece en la práctica: ¿quién define los roles y quién se hace responsable de revisarlos periódicamente? Una empresa de energía implementó MFA para usuarios críticos, pero descubrió que sin procesos de recertificación, la complejidad administrativa creció exponencialmente.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿En tu organización la gestión de identidades es una práctica madura con roles y procesos claros, o sigue siendo una tarea reactiva que depende del equipo Basis?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2024/10/46dcb1da-db7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sustainability Control Tower: visibilidad ESG en tiempo real&lt;/STRONG&gt; La herramienta permite consolidar métricas ambientales, sociales y de gobernanza en un solo panel conectado a SAP y fuentes externas. El valor es dar a CFOs y responsables de sostenibilidad una visión clara para reportes y decisiones estratégicas. Integrada con BTP, gana aún más potencia: puede aprovechar conectores preconfigurados, flujos de datos en tiempo real y dashboards de analítica avanzada, evitando desarrollos ad-hoc y reduciendo el time-to-value.

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP AI Core y modelos propios en BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt; Las empresas ya pueden entrenar y desplegar sus propios modelos en SAP AI Core con integración nativa a datos SAP. Esto abre la puerta a IA especializada en cada industria, pero plantea un dilema: ¿cómo equilibrar innovación con compliance? Una aseguradora podría entrenar un modelo para detección de fraudes, pero ¿qué pasa si no logra explicabilidad suficiente? La promesa es grande, el riesgo también.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Tu organización está lista para invertir en IA propia o preferís modelos preentrenados de SAP y partners?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Nuevo release de SAP Integration Suite&lt;/STRONG&gt; La suite incorpora conectores preconfigurados para Salesforce, Workday y ServiceNow, simplificando arquitecturas híbridas. El beneficio es velocidad en despliegues, pero la realidad es que muchas empresas ya tienen middleware paralelo. Un retail puede ver valor en unificar todo en BTP, pero el costo de “migrar lo viejo” nunca es trivial.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Vale la pena consolidar integraciones en una sola plataforma o es mejor convivir con múltiples soluciones?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/what-s-new-for-sap-integration-suite-june-amp-july-2024/ba-p/13787789" target="_self"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;DataSphere y federación en tiempo real&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP Datasphere suma capacidades para federar datos en vivo desde Snowflake y BigQuery, sin replicación masiva. Esto cambia el juego: menos ETL, más velocidad. Una minera podría consultar KPIs financieros y de producción en un único dashboard, pero la latencia y la calidad de metadatos pueden ser talón de Aquiles.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Creés que el futuro es federar datos en vivo o seguir apostando a replicar en un único repositorio?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://learning.sap.com/courses/exploring-sap-datasphere/introducing-sap-datasphere-integration-options" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Developers: IA gratis hasta 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt; El programa permite a los desarrolladores usar capacidades de IA generativa dentro de SAP Build Code, Build Apps, Process Automation y entornos ABAP sin costo hasta septiembre de 2026. Esto acelera la creación de aplicaciones, automatiza procesos y mejora la productividad, pero también plantea un reto: ¿cómo asegurar que los equipos realmente adopten la herramienta y no quede como “demo eterna”? Imaginemos un equipo de manufactura que genera código para integrarse con sensores IoT en minutos, pero sin estrategia de adopción puede terminar en pilotos aislados sin impacto real.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿En tu empresa ya están explorando Joule for Developers o aún se percibe como una prueba de laboratorio sin plan de escalamiento?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7371164704255328256/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Gestión de identidades con CIS: más allá del SSO&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP Cloud Identity Services ya no es solo un proveedor de inicio de sesión único: hoy permite aplicar MFA (autenticación multifactor), gestionar identidades externas y controlar accesos en entornos híbridos. El beneficio es claro: menos riesgos de seguridad y más trazabilidad. Pero el desafío aparece en la práctica: ¿quién define los roles y quién se hace responsable de revisarlos periódicamente? Una empresa de energía implementó MFA para usuarios críticos, pero descubrió que sin procesos de recertificación, la complejidad administrativa creció exponencialmente.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿En tu organización la gestión de identidades es una práctica madura con roles y procesos claros, o sigue siendo una tarea reactiva que depende del equipo Basis?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2024/10/46dcb1da-db7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sustainability Control Tower: visibilidad ESG en tiempo real&lt;/STRONG&gt; La herramienta permite consolidar métricas ambientales, sociales y de gobernanza en un solo panel conectado a SAP y fuentes externas. El valor es dar a CFOs y responsables de sostenibilidad una visión clara para reportes y decisiones estratégicas. Integrada con BTP, gana aún más potencia: puede aprovechar conectores preconfigurados, flujos de datos en tiempo real y dashboards de analítica avanzada, evitando desarrollos ad-hoc y reduciendo el time-to-value. El reto está en la calidad y consistencia de los datos: una empresa de retail logró integrar emisiones de su cadena logística, pero descubrió que sin estandarizar la captura de datos de proveedores, los reportes perdían comparabilidad.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Tu empresa ya mide indicadores ESG de forma integrada con SAP o todavía depende de reportes manuales y dispersos?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journeys/administering-sustainability-control-tower/integrating-sap-sustainability-control-tower-with-sap-systems" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build Apps y citizen developers&lt;/STRONG&gt; El nuevo release permite que usuarios de negocio creen apps móviles con integración directa a SAP S/4HANA.

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Hi SAP Community Members,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Recently, we have deployed Joule in our SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition. We found the performance is disappointing. Although we have raised several support tickets to SAP OSS, it is very time consuming (We have found a lot of issues, including transactional capabilities, navigational capabilities, and informational capabilities when testing it), and it seems currently there is no official way for us to share our feedback about Joule. (We cannot find Joule on the Customer Influence Portal)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;The following are the issues of Joule’s navigational capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note&lt;/STRONG&gt;: I have added all standard roles in IAS and suppose it is not an authorization issue.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Issue 1:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Cannot provide Navigation Link&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Please see the following surprising conversation with Joule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We ask “Fiori App to create PO”. Joule cannot provide the navigation link for such Fiori Apps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="image 1.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315462i33B72D3997C08390/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="image 1.png" alt="image 1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When we ask “App to create PO”, Joule can provide the navigation link.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 2.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315463iD52B1CA5E383D13C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture 2.png" alt="Picture 2.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Issue 2:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Does not support GUI transactions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We understand that navigational capabilities only support Fiori Apps. However, I hope SAP Joule will provide navigation capabilities for GUI transactions in the future. Otherwise, we will face the following issue.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We ask “App for Clearing Open Item Automatically”. Although no Fiori app is for F.13, &lt;STRONG&gt;it should not suggest F2223 (Reset Cleared Items)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="picture 3.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315465i4FFF184499695DFF/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="picture 3.png" alt="picture 3.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It will only show the correct result if we ask for tcode.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="picture 4.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315466i25FD8FB18FEA81B7/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="picture 4.png" alt="picture 4.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Then we ask “App for Open MM Period” Joule will provide irrelevant Fiori apps. including F2293 (Open FI Period) and F4684 (Open CO Period) when no Fiori app is for opening MM period.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="picture 5.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315467iF86421392057CEE4/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="picture 5.png" alt="picture 5.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;If we ask the same question again, Joule will provide a weird query to us&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Picture 6.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/315472iE71FF103C3FFE5AD/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Picture 6.png" alt="Picture 6.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;We have tested a lot of Joule’s Base capabilities. Most users feel frustrated with its performance. My comment is “Joule is a product with unlimited potential. However, currently it is still at an early stage.” I believe Joule will perform much and much better when our feedback can reach the SAP Joule Product Team.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Thanks for your reading,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Chak&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;With SAP’s recent focus on developer productivity, Joule&amp;nbsp;is becoming an integral part of our toolset. If you’re already working with Eclipse IDE and ABAP Development Tools (ADT), you might be wondering how to bring Joule into your existing setup without starting from scratch.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I’ll walk you through a simple process to enable Joule in Eclipse if you already have an older version installed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1760867267"&gt;Why Joule in Eclipse?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule brings AI assistance right into your familiar development environment. Gone are the days when boring coding used to happen. Now we have Joule to explain the code, finding out the dependencies like which ABAP objects( DB tables, CDS views, interfaces, etc) are referred in long code lines which never ends, Joule can understand your code and write ABAP units for you in no time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Less talking, more work. Let's follow the steps below and get yourself introduce to one and only "Joule".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1693436481"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 1 – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Update ADT Patch&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ensure that your Eclipse has the latest ABAP Development Tools (ADT) patch.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Open Eclipse.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Go to Help → Install New Software.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="vasuabes2011_1-1758269897880.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316850i9DE3DAD7DF2C4377/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="vasuabes2011_1-1758269897880.png" alt="vasuabes2011_1-1758269897880.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Add the latest ADT update site:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;https:&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;//tools.hana.ondemand.com/latest&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="vasuabes2011_2-1758269927468.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316851i846B41D030C017AF/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="vasuabes2011_2-1758269927468.png" alt="vasuabes2011_2-1758269927468.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Select the updates and proceed with installation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1496922976"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Step 2 – Update Eclipse Version&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To access the Joule menu, Eclipse itself needs to be updated.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Go to Eclipse menu → About Eclipse IDE.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Click the Update button.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="vasuabes2011_3-1758270008091.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316852i1AE9D96F96878FCB/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="vasuabes2011_3-1758270008091.png" alt="vasuabes2011_3-1758270008091.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="vasuabes2011_4-1758270042134.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316853iDD30ABCC92366FE2/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="vasuabes2011_4-1758270042134.png" alt="vasuabes2011_4-1758270042134.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;Wait for Eclipse to fetch and apply updates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1171326752"&gt;That’s It!&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the update is complete, you’ll notice the Joule option appearing in your Eclipse menu.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="vasuabes2011_7-1758270247672.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/316857i1DC4BDF537042EEA/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="vasuabes2011_7-1758270247672.png" alt="vasuabes2011_7-1758270247672.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The future of enterprise AI will be driven by the deep and seamless integration of LLMs into existing enterprise products and workflows. To stay competitive, companies must make their vast landscape of existing capabilities directly accessible and usable by AI, empowering a new generation of intelligent ecosystems. This requires a clear strategy for enabling agent interoperability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this article,&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;we will &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;establish that the journey to agent interoperability begins with a foundational pillar: enabling agents to reliably connect with tools (Agent-to-Tool). We'll start by defining the foundational challenge that prevents agents and tools from communicating effectively. We will then introduce the&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Model Context Protocol&lt;/A&gt; (MCP) as a standardized solution and walk through a step-by-step tutorial on how to transform a standard REST API into a fully compliant MCP Server using a cloud-native gateway.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1629994205"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What is Agent Interoperability and Why Does It Matter?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Agent Interoperability is a comprehensive framework for a complete AI ecosystem, which relies on two fundamental pillars: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) interaction and Agent-to-Tool (A2T) interaction.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;While A2A interaction—how agents collaborate and delegate tasks—represents a sophisticated, multi-agent system's goal, A2T interaction is the foundational prerequisite. The ability of agents to collaborate is contingent upon their individual capacity to connect to tools.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Therefore, solving the Agent-to-Tool challenge is the most critical first step towards the broader goal of agent interoperability. While not an Agent-to-Agent protocol itself, solving the Agent-to-Tool challenge is the most critical first step towards the broader goal of agent interoperability: how to let any agent discover and use any external capability in a standardized way.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1433480700"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Foundational Challenge: Connecting Agents to Enterprise Tools&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In an enterprise environment like SAP,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;this challenge presents distinct engineering considerations on both sides of the connection:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;On the agent side&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;: The challenge is building agents with the autonomy to dynamically discover and utilize a diverse set of capabilities, moving beyond static tool integrations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;On the capability side&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;The engineering task is to adapt SAP's vast landscape of powerful APIs for a new type of consumer: the autonomous AI agent.&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;The goal is to create AI-consumable interfaces for these existing capabilities, which involves adding the necessary semantic context and standardized formats that agents require for dynamic interaction&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This difference in design paradigms creates a natural "Interoperability Gap”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Bridging this gap requires a foundational layer for communication: a standardized protocol that enables dynamic discovery and standardized interaction between agents and established enterprise APIs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1236967195"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Solution: MCP as a Standardized Protocol Bridge&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So, how do we bridge this "Interoperability Gap"? The solution lies in a shared standard—a common language that both agents and tools can speak. This is where the Model Context Protocol (MCP)&amp;nbsp; comes in.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We use MCP to build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. The key participants in the MCP architecture are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Host&lt;/STRONG&gt;: The AI application that coordinates and manages one or multiple MCP clients&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Client&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A component that maintains a connection to an MCP server and obtains context from an MCP server for the MCP host to use&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Server&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A program that provides context to MCP clients&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 18.23.05.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/307786i34101443A9040C2B/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 18.23.05.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-02 at 18.23.05.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As for enterprise like SAP, the best practice will be:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Yarloy_Wang_0-1757496429561.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312186iAC4A61BEC1A4FF81/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Yarloy_Wang_0-1757496429561.png" alt="Yarloy_Wang_0-1757496429561.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, a protocol is only useful if capabilities adopt it. The enterprise landscape is filled with valuable, pre-existing REST APIs that were not built for this new paradigm. Therefore, a critical first step toward achieving agent interoperability is to bridge these legacy APIs to the MCP standard.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The act of transforming a standard API into a discoverable MCP Server is the foundational process for unlocking existing enterprise value for AI agents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1169536409"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;MCP Adoption Strategy in Enterprise Ecosystems&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When adopting a new standard like MCP within a large enterprise ecosystem like SAP, there are typically two primary strategic paths to consider for implementation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. The Standard Path:&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Platform-Managed Solutions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For most common use cases, the standard approach is to leverage platform-integrated, centrally managed solutions. This path involves using automated services, often provided by the enterprise platform (e.g., SAP BTP), to convert existing APIs into standardized tools. By using unified method for transformation, this approach ensures consistency and manageability across the entire ecosystem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. The&amp;nbsp;Flexible Path: Custom or "Native" Implementations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For scenario demanding greater flexibility or more complex business logic, a more custom approach is required. This involves building what can be considered "native" MCP servers. This approach allows teams to build custom implementations using a variety of technologies, such as open-source libraries or different programming languages, giving them full control over the implementation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This Guide's Focus: A Hands-on Example of the Flexible Path&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the following guide, we will focus on the flexible, native server approach. &lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;We will demonstrate a powerful and practical pattern for this by using a cloud-native gateway, Higress, to wrap an existing API. This method is ideal for teams who require full control over the transformation logic and deployment environment, providing a valuable, hands-on example of building a native-style MCP server.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-843940185"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step-by-Step Guide: Transforming API into MCP Server&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To see how this concept works in the real world, let's take a standard REST API and use a gateway to transform it into a fully-compliant MCP server.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Our Goal&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Wrap a simple HTTP API as an MCP Server and invoke it from an agent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Our Tools&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Simple API:&lt;/STRONG&gt; A REST API that returns&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;real-time currency exchange data&lt;/SPAN&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Gateway:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;A href="https://higress.cn/en/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Higress&lt;/A&gt;, an open-source, cloud-native gateway with a powerful plugin architecture.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Standard:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The Model Context Protocol (MCP), which we'll implement using the Higress MCP Plugin.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Environment:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;A Kubernetes environment&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-776509399"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-579995894"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A Modern Transport Protocol: Streamable HTTP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before we begin, it's important to understand transport mechanisms for client-server communication we'll be using. This guide utilizes a modern and powerful approach defined by the MCP standard: &lt;A href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http%20" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Streamable HTTP&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We chose this approach for several key advantages that make it superior for modern AI systems:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Simplified Architecture:&lt;/STRONG&gt; In the Streamable HTTP transport, the server operates as an independent process that can handle multiple client connections. Because the session context is maintained within this single, stateful connection, the need for an external session manager like Redis is often eliminated.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Bidirectional and Flexible Communication:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The protocol handles simple request-response patterns efficiently but also enables true bidirectional communication. Server can optionally make use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream multiple server messages. This permits basic MCP servers, as well as more feature-rich servers supporting streaming and server-to-client notifications and requests.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-383482389"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Step 1: The Starting Point - A Simple REST API&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As the requirement of Streamable HTTP, The server MUST provide a single HTTP endpoint path (hereafter referred to as the MCP endpoint) that supports both POST and GET methods.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To demonstrate the transformation process, this guide will use the ExchangeRate-API, a professional service that provides real-time currency exchange data. We'll use its lasted&amp;nbsp;endpoint, which returns up-to-date global rates based on the US Dollar.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;API Endpoint:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;A successful request to this endpoint returns a JSON object with a structure similar to this, containing metadata and a nested rates object:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "result": "success",
  "time_last_update_utc": "Mon, 15 Sep 2025 00:02:31 +0000",
  "base_code": "USD",
  "rates": {
    "USD": 1,
    "EUR": 0.925,
    "GBP": 0.789,
    ...
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;This represents a typical "legacy" capability—useful, but not inherently agent-friendly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-186968884"&gt;Step 2: Preparing the Gateway with Higress&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of modifying the API's code, we'll use a gateway to act as a transformation layer. Higress is an ideal choice because its plugin architecture is designed to extend gateway capabilities, including native support for AI scenarios through protocols like MCP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-119538098"&gt;2.1 Higress Deployment&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;First, install Higress into your cluster environment (To simplify, we use k3s as an example).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Check your console's node port:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl get svc higress-console -n higress-system&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once the installation succeeds, you can access the Higress Console in browser by &lt;A target="_self"&gt;http://&amp;lt;your-cluster-external-ip&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;console-port&amp;gt;&lt;/A&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Yarloy_Wang_3-1757496799751.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/312202i2AEEFF7078F6613E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Yarloy_Wang_3-1757496799751.png" alt="Yarloy_Wang_3-1757496799751.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--152206776"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--348720281"&gt;2.2 Config MCP Server&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once deployed, we need to enable the MCP Server functionality globally by editing the higress-config ConfigMap.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl edit configmap higress-config -n higress-system&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the ConfigMap data, we'll add the MCP Server configuration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion: v1

Now you can see the new route in the list.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At this point, Higress will simply proxy requests from&lt;EM&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;/exchange-rates&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;to our API.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId--1821204318"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--1724314816"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;3.

This is where we define the metadata that makes our API discoverable and understandable to agents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Yarloy_Wang_2-1757931258146.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/314431i2976D125D06884AC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Yarloy_Wang_2-1757931258146.png" alt="Yarloy_Wang_2-1757931258146.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Paste the following configuration:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;server:
  name: "exchange-rate-server"
tools:
  - name: "get-latest-usd-rates"
    description: "Fetches the latest currency exchange rates based on the US Dollar."
    requestTemplate:
      method: "GET"
      url: "https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD"
    responseTemplate:
      body: |-
        **Latest Exchange Rates (Base: {{.base_code}})**
        *Updated at: {{.time_last_update_utc}}*
        
        - **Euro (EUR):** {{.rates.EUR}}
        - **Japanese Yen (JPY):** {{.rates.JPY}}
        - **British Pound (GBP):** {{.rates.GBP}}
        - **Chinese Yuan (CNY):** {{.rates.CNY}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let's break this down:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;server.name: A human-readable name for our new MCP server.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;tools: A list of capabilities this server provides.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;name &amp;amp; description: The crucial metadata for agent to intelligently discover and select this tool when a user asks about exchange rates.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;requestTemplate &amp;amp; responseTemplate: These define how Higress calls the backend API and formats the response. Here, the requestTemplate specifies a simple GET request, and the responseTemplate transforms the JSON output into a clean, agent-friendly format.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Save the plugin configuration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Our standard REST API is now exposed as a fully functional and discoverable MCP Server, ready for any compliant AI agent to use.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1627425314"&gt;Step 4: Connecting and Invoking from an Agent with Streamable HTTP&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, any MCP-compliant agent or client can connect to our gateway and use this new tool. To test our new MCP server, we can use any compliant MCP Host app, such as Cline, Cursor, Trae, etc.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For this guide, we'll use &lt;A href="https://cline.bot%20" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Cline&lt;/A&gt; as example. It's &lt;SPAN&gt;an autonomous coding agent&lt;/SPAN&gt; that can be&lt;SPAN&gt; installed&lt;/SPAN&gt; as a VS Code extension&lt;SPAN&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;Configure Cline with the following setting to establish a connection to our new server:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-json"&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exchange-rate-server": {
      "url": "http://&amp;lt;your-cluster-external-ip&amp;gt;/exchange-rates",
      "type": "streamableHttp"
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now you can test the server in Cline:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Yarloy_Wang_3-1757931306012.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/314432iA494F5F67F1D73A3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Yarloy_Wang_3-1757931306012.png" alt="Yarloy_Wang_3-1757931306012.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1655755128"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In this post, we've navigated a practical path toward the broader vision of agent interoperability. We established that the most critical first step is solving the Agent-to-Tool (A2T) challenge: making existing enterprise APIs discoverable and usable by AI agents. We then demonstrated a powerful pattern to achieve this, using a cloud-native gateway, Higress, to transform a standard REST API into a fully compliant MCP Server. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The most powerful takeaway is demonstrating a flexible path to a native server: You've learned how a gateway-centric pattern can be used to build a "native" MCP server, offering full control to teams that require flexibility and customization in their MCP adoption strategy. It means existing, valuable enterprise services can be rapidly integrated into the agent ecosystem, making them dynamically discoverable and usable by any MCP-compliant agent.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Solving the Agent-to-Tool problem building the foundation for agent interoperability. With a robust A2T layer in place, the path is cleared for more advanced Agent-to-Agent collaboration, paves the way for a future where countless enterprise services can be seamlessly integrated with agent ecosystem.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Hello everyone ! I am &lt;STRONG&gt;Shruthi&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a Project Manager of BTP ABAP AI, and I am just about to celebrate my &lt;STRONG&gt;first anniversary with my team&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Looking back at this past year, I feel so grateful for the people I work with, the projects we have delivered, and the way we have grown together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;One thing I have noticed time and again is how small changes—like a new validation rule, a UI tweak, or a simple workflow adjustment—can have a huge impact for business users. But these “small” requests often take longer than expected because they get caught in processes and development backlogs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;That is why the recent blogs on &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ABAP AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; and the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extensibility Assistant&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; really resonate with me. They show how SAP is already delivering tools that make development faster and extensibility safer.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Highlights You Should Explore&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here are some excellent resources that set the stage for this journey:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;@Simona Marincei’s Blog: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/abap-ai-revolution-accelerates-the-abap-developer-who-built-enterprise-apps/ba-p/14216073" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ABAP AI Revolution: Accelerates the ABAP Developer Who Built Enterprise Apps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/44793"&gt;@Georg&lt;/a&gt;Wilhelm’s Blog :&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/extensibility-assistant-for-key-users-the-extensibility-expert-right-next/ba-p/14216097" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Extensibility Assistant for Key Users: The Extensibility Expert Right Next to You&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/4870"&gt;@Alexander&lt;/a&gt;Rother’s Blog:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/abap-ai-chapter-2/ba-p/14210568" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ABAP AI Chapter 2&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwtRsMRLPYU&amp;amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAt9lvPw0gF4E3nwbJD0EUe" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule for Developers – YouTube Playlist&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule for Developers, ABAP AI Capabilities – Free and Ready to Use&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;One of the most exciting developments for us right now is &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule for Developers, ABAP AI Capabilities&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

Joule Studio y agentes de IA en procesos SAP&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP anunció que Joule Studio será generalmente disponible en junio de 2025 como entorno integrado en SAP Build para construir habilidades (skills) y agentes de IA que ejecutan workflows complejos. Los desarrolladores podrán diseñar agentes que actúen con contexto de negocio en procesos, no solo tareas puntuales. La Integration Suite sumará capacidades de recomendación automática y predicción de anomalías en API calls. Esto reduce código repetitivo y acelera la automatización contextual. Pero la gobernanza será clave para evitar “cajas negras”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ventajas :&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Acelera el desarrollo de procesos inteligentes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mejora la eficiencia operativa con agentes en tiempo real.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Incrementa la trazabilidad y capacidad de respuesta.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/spain/products/artificial-intelligence/joule-studio.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Dejarías que un agente autónomo ejecute decisiones operativas en tu organización?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember783" id="toc-hId-1694329250"&gt;2. SAP Build Process Automation con IA generativa&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP Build Process Automation incorpora IA generativa para que usuarios de negocio diseñen flujos sin necesidad de código. Un CFO o analista puede describir un proceso en lenguaje natural y el sistema genera el flujo base. Arquitectos y desarrolladores ajustan la lógica para robustecerlo. Esto acelera la entrega de valor en procesos clave. El reto será equilibrar agilidad con gobernanza y control.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ventajas :&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Democratiza la automatización para áreas de negocio.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduce tiempos de entrega de procesos digitales.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Fomenta colaboración entre negocio y tecnología.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mejoras-con-ia-generativa-en-sap-build-joule-josep-portabella-i-trias-gdlgf/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Más información&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Confiarías en que áreas de negocio creen flujos críticos con IA generativa?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember789" id="toc-hId-1497815745"&gt;3. SAP Business Network sobre SAP BTP&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;La red de colaboración SAP Business Network se integra más fuerte a BTP. Esto habilita trazabilidad, compliance e IA nativos en la red. Los procesos con proveedores y compradores ganan sincronía. Pero aumenta la complejidad de gobernanza y onboarding de socios. La adopción depende también de la madurez de cada partner.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ventajas :&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mayor transparencia en la cadena de suministro.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Procesos más ágiles entre múltiples organizaciones.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cumplimiento normativo más fácil de demostrar.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://news.sap.com/2025/06/sap-btp-sap-business-network-innovation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Extenderías procesos críticos a tu red de socios usando BTP?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember795" id="toc-hId-1301302240"&gt;4. Innovaciones de AI en SAP Integration Suite&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Integration Suite ahora sugiere mapas de integración y detecta conflictos automáticamente. Se anuncia un “adaptador AI” para conectar LLM externos. Esto acelera los ciclos de integración con recomendaciones en tiempo real. Permite prever consumos de API y anticipar cuellos de botella. Los equipos deberán validar sugerencias de la IA para asegurar calidad.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ventajas :&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduce tiempos de desarrollo y testing.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Anticipa problemas antes de que impacten la operación.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Facilita integraciones complejas con IA como copiloto.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sap-integration-suite-accelerates-productivity-new-ai-mu%C3%B1oz-%C3%A1lvarez-zrmyf/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Más información&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Confiarías en una IA para diseñar mapas de integración productivos?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember801" id="toc-hId-1104788735"&gt;5. Estrategia “Clean Core + extensibilidad con BTP”&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;La idea central es mantener el core SAP estándar y mover extensiones a BTP. Esto evita deuda técnica y facilita upgrades en el core. Implica rediseñar límites entre procesos estándar y diferenciadores. Las extensiones requieren su propia gobernanza y testing. Es un cambio cultural y técnico importante.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ventajas :&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Facilita actualizaciones del core.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Permite innovar sin comprometer estabilidad.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reduce costos de mantenimiento a largo plazo.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/spain/resources/what-is-a-clean-core" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Más información&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Tu empresa ya avanza hacia un core limpio o aún lo ves lejano?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember807" id="toc-hId-908275230"&gt;6. Gobernanza de datos en entornos BTP híbridos&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;La mezcla de datos SAP y no SAP en BTP exige un modelo de gobierno sólido. Es clave definir roles, propiedad y calidad del dato maestro. La replicación entre entornos puede generar inconsistencias si no se diseña bien. Se deben cumplir regulaciones locales y globales de privacidad. El lineage del dato será un diferenciador en auditorías.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ventajas :&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Mayor confianza en reportes y decisiones.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cumplimiento más sencillo ante auditorías.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Reducción de duplicaciones e inconsistencias.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":link:"&gt;🔗&lt;/span&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/latinamerica/products/data-cloud/master-data-governance/what-is-data-governance.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Más información&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;¿Preferís un modelo único de datos o múltiples vistas según área de negocio?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="ember813" id="toc-hId-711761725"&gt;7. Adopción de BTP en industrias reguladas&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Industrias reguladas exigen trazabilidad, certificaciones y seguridad extrema. SAP NS2 propone un marco específico para implementar BTP en estos entornos. Esto incluye segregación de ambientes y auditoría constante. El cumplimiento requiere alineación entre IT, compliance y negocio.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Today, we are going to use Joule’s asynchronous (async) feature to establish communication between &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule and a &lt;STRONG&gt;custom BTP app.&lt;BR /&gt;Joule has a limitation when handling responses that take longer than &lt;STRONG&gt;45 seconds, so we need to enable the async feature to properly support long-running responses.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1890867585"&gt;Step 1: Understand the Requirements&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before starting, please review the help documentation:&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/joule-development-guide/asynchronous-api-requests?state=DRAFT&amp;amp;version=DEV" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Asynchronous API Requests&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The prerequisites are critical:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To enable asynchronous API requests:&lt;BR /&gt;• IAS-enabled subaccount&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; o The BTP subaccount must be integrated with SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS)&lt;BR /&gt;• For callback support your backend has to:&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; o Perform the actual asynchronous task.&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; o Send a callback to Joule once complete.&lt;BR /&gt;• A trust configuration must be set up between the backend system and Joule:&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; o This requires implementation efforts on Joule integration configuration&lt;BR /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; o To trigger this, create an AIPS requirement on the Joule component in Jira&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are trying to enable the async feature of Joule on a &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP LoB product, you need to create an &lt;STRONG&gt;AIPS Jira ticket.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;HR /&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1694354080"&gt;Step 2: App2App with IAS&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;To enable the async feature with IAS, we use the &lt;STRONG&gt;App2App approach.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;If you are interested, learn the concepts of Inbound and Outbound App2App for SAP DAS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once familiar, you can start setting up trust between Joule and IAS:&lt;BR /&gt;Our scenario is:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;DIV class=""&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;CODE&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule &amp;lt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;-&amp;gt; custom app&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;P&gt;We can directly link Joule's Cloud Identity Service to the custom app's Cloud Identity Service.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. Go to BTP -&amp;gt; create CIS service.&amp;nbsp;In my case, my custom app's CIS is named&amp;nbsp;as&lt;STRONG&gt; "giaIas".&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-09-30 at 11.28.14 AM.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321781i169F07D99326D492/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-09-30 at 11.28.14 AM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-30 at 11.28.14 AM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt; &lt;/P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="rui_jin_0-1759258110330.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/321784iF76A800FD3ACF869/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="rui_jin_0-1759258110330.png" alt="rui_jin_0-1759258110330.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1732412865"&gt;Introduction&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the era of AI-first development, embedding intelligence into business applications is no longer optional—it's expected. As an application developer working on SAP BTP, I was recently tasked with enhancing our&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Refunds Analysis&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;application with a&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;forecasting component&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The challenge? I’m not a data scientist.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But thanks to the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;HANA AI Toolkit&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;, SAP Build Code’s AI co-pilot, I was able to build a robust forecasting solution—without needing deep expertise in machine learning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this blog, I’ll walk you through how I used a simple slash command&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;/hana-ai&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;to interact with the HANA AI Toolkit via Joule, and how this integration empowered me to build, evaluate, and deploy a forecasting model in just a few conversational steps.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1535899360"&gt;What is the HANA AI Toolkit?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;The&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP/generative-ai-toolkit-for-sap-hana-cloud" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Generative AI Toolkit for SAP HANA Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;is a powerful suite of tools designed to simplify the use of SAP HANA’s machine learning and vector capabilities. It includes:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Conversational agents for building forecasting models&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Tools for selecting and applying ML algorithms&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SmartDataFrame interface for natural language data exploration&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Vector and embedding services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Code generation components for SAP HANA Cloud scenarios&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1339385855"&gt;Meet Joule: Your AI Co-Pilot in SAP Build Code&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;is SAP Build Code’s generative AI assistant, designed to help developers write, generate, and integrate code faster. With the new&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;/hana-ai&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;slash command, Joule can now directly interact with the HANA AI Toolkit—bringing ML capabilities into the hands of every developer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1142872350"&gt;My Use Case: Forecasting Sales Refunds&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here’s how I used the integration to build a forecasting model for our
