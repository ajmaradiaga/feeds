    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This fourth post in my series gives an overview of user experience innovations in SAP SuccessFactors. It covers Joule and many AI-based UX innovations along with enhanced user experiences. &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;By following the career of Jon, who starts by applying for a job and then grows within the company, you can see how our latest user experience innovations help business users (employees and managers), work more effectively.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before reading this, do read the first blog post introducing the series and providing general information about Joule and central entry points and services, along with links to all the published parts of this blog post series:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also, if you missed it, do have a look at the many UX innovations which already came out end of last year with the SAP SuccessFactors 2H2024 release:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q1-2025-update-part-3-sap-successfactors-ai-joule-and/ba-p/14020027" target="_blank"&gt;SAP User Experience Q1/2025 Update – Part 3: SAP SuccessFactors (AI, Joule and More)&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The 1H2025 release comes with a large number of UX innovations across the whole portfolio. &lt;SPAN&gt;In the following sections, I’ll summarize the main highlights by following the career of Jon, and showing how the new AI-powered UX innovations help:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon find the right job with the help of the new guided application experience.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Managers move through the hiring process more efficiently, rating skills and competencies of candidates with Joule, and getting AI-assisted interview insights.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon understand the main features available to him in his employee HR applications.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon get an easy-to-understand overview of his benefits and payroll.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon use natural language with &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt; to get questions answered and detailed information about pay statements, not only from at his desk but &lt;STRONG&gt;also via mobile phone.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon learn more, with learning overview and skilled-based learning recommendations.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Jon and his manager to manage goals and performance reviews, with AI-insights making his manager’s job a lot easier.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;One more innovation is the new alumni experience, for departing and departed employees, helping them to&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Manage personal information and access important documents during and after the off-boarding process.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To get the complete picture of all the new SuccessFactors innovations, have a look at the links in the “Further Information “ section towards the end of this post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1607984268"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Find the Right Job With New Guided Application Experience&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Jon is applying for a job at a company which uses SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting, and finds the whole process very intuitive, thanks to the new guided application experience, as well as the further enhancements in the reimagined candidate experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figure 1 shows the new guided application experience. This attractive UI guides applicants through the required steps, with AI-assistance provided along the way. For example, Figure 1 shows the AI button “Suggest Skills”, which can help candidates when listing their own skills by indicating other skills which they may also have but did not consider mentioning.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: Guided job application experience with SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting.

If Jon wants to review his candidate profile and make adjustments, this is also easier now with the refreshed candidate profile. See examples of these, and more, here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Blog post: &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/human-capital-management-blog-posts-by-sap/1h-2025-explore-the-reimagined-candidate-experience-and-new-ai-assisted/ba-p/14096751" target="_blank"&gt;1H 2025: Explore the Reimagined Candidate Experience and New AI-Assisted Capabilities in Recruiting&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Documentation: &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/successfactors-release-information/8e0d540f96474717bbf18df51e54e522/36476f5926024234a4370d73ea454075.html?parentHref=/whats-new/8fcf4960eea24f78b1d7613da406a885?locale=en-US&amp;amp;parentName=SAP+SuccessFactors+What%27s+New&amp;amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The Reimagined Candidate Experience&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1411470763"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule and AI-Assisted Interview Insights Help Managers Recruit&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1344039977"&gt;Providing Interview Feedback with Joule&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once the interview has taken place, each interviewer needs to summarize their feedback on the candidates, such as Jon. This can now be done easily using Joule and natural language, where you can say who you want to give feedback for and assing the ratings all in one go, as you can see in Figure 2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 2: Providing interview feedback with Joule.

This is where the AI-assisted interview insights comes in handy: by clicking on the AI “generate” button, the manager gets a natural language summary of the interviewer’s feedback on the candidate Jon. This is provided in sections Overview, Strengths, Concerns, Interviewer’s Overall Feedback, with a separate section Data Referenced that provides an overview of the inputs used to create the AI-assisted insights. Figure 3 shows an example, and Figure 4 shows it in action.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not only does this help the manager save time and be more efficient, it also helps her be more effective: the feedback across multiple candidates is consolidated consistently, ensuring that all aspects of a candidate’s interview feedback are consolidated and uniformly presented. Furthermore, key insights are highlighted.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3: AI-assisted interview insights with SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting.

This is now easy with the enhanced People Profile in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, which provides quick access to the various parts of your benefits (Figure 6) and payroll information (Figure 7).

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The year 2025 has marked a significant turning point in enterprise technology, with AI agents becoming integral to operations across nearly every business line. SAP has been at the forefront of this transformation, introducing groundbreaking innovations such as Joule Studio, designed to empower organizations with intelligent automation and seamless workflow orchestration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Automations and workflows are streamlining repetitive manual tasks, while AI agents are increasingly being used to perform tasks autonomously across various business lines. And industry leaders are demanding automations and AI agents to make sure they remain in the competition and do not miss out on the advantages that these solutions bring to the table. Joule Studio provides abilities to SAP developers and users to build, deploy and run Custom Joule Skills and Custom Joule Agents in a short span of time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule Studio brings in ease of use by abstracting all the technicalities and providing an interactive UI to build Custom Joule Skills and Custom Joule Agents in on-the-go fashion in SAP Build. One of the features of Joule Studio is that it enables the creation of Custom Joule Skills. Custom Joule Skills are nothing but automations of any manual, repetitive and rule-based task like reading data from a website and updating the same in SAP HANA cloud database. Read about the difference between Joule Skills and SAP BPA automations in this &lt;A href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.sap.com%2Ft5%2Ftechnology-blog-posts-by-sap%2Fjoule-studio-goes-live-answers-to-your-top-questions%2Fba-p%2F14152403&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjuhi.kulshreshtha%40mindsprint.org%7Cc9245b5db37f49182f1108ddd9b12fdf%7C5e007b6c258b4fdeadc18bf8a135885d%7C0%7C0%7C638906077320266201%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=eNnkOr1zF3Er6dWqwR%2BX8%2F01D1ZgPHtLJaK%2BAigt7ic%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;FAQ Blog&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Custom Joule Skills thus built get utilised by Custom Joule Agents created in Joule Studio. Building a Custom Joule Agent is even easier than assembling Lego blocks. Joule Studio acts as a helper and instructor right from the start of interaction asking specifications and providing options to choose from. Please note that Custom Joule Agent building feature is currently in &lt;A href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscovery-center.cloud.sap%2Fai-feature%2Fc95490eb-95c3-4b0a-b9ea-08144355d482%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjuhi.kulshreshtha%40mindsprint.org%7Cc9245b5db37f49182f1108ddd9b12fdf%7C5e007b6c258b4fdeadc18bf8a135885d%7C0%7C0%7C638906077320294024%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=ogDwvbzdcdV4lgNNOozH%2FBhs0XFKoFgaFTyCS%2B%2F%2BRc4%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;beta&lt;/A&gt; and expected to be released in coming months.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Why Joule Studio?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule Studio provides one-stop-shop for building ‘Joule Skills’ and ‘Joule Agents’ with an exceptionally user-friendly interface. A developer or user can interact with Joule Studio in natural language and get all the assistance needed for building Custom Joules Skills or Custom Joule Agents.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Another advantage of choosing Joule Studio over other non-SAP AI tools is that ‘Joule Studio’ understands SAP and its mechanism is deeply grounded in the business processes and the data of the SAP systems. This provides significant advantage when developing cross-module automation. Thus, providing seamless user-experience across or non-uniform SAP landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although Joule comes with lots of pre-built Joule Skills in various LOBs like Finance, Procurement etc., Joule Studio can be used now to build Custom Joule Skills adding user specific features and outcomes. The existing processes and workflows can be reused while building the Joule Skills. Security setup in Joule is based on principal propagation. Existing BTP setup can be used to configure security in Joule. Additionally, Joule Studio has features of data masking and data filtering for security and compliance purposes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prerequisites to setup Joule Studio -&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Setting up Joule Studio has broadly three prerequisites. First, you should be subscribed to Joule. Second, subscription to SAP Build using &lt;STRONG&gt;build-default&lt;/STRONG&gt; service plan is required and you should have an SAP BTP sub account with SAP Build Process Automation. Third, you should subscribe to SAP Cloud Identity Services in SAP BTP.

Here are some of the ways to make sure that these are more efficient, insightful, and aligned with strategic goals –&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Pay attention to the data. It should be accurate to reflect the real-world values. It should be complete and without missing values. The data should be consistent across the landscape for better insight. And the data should be up-to-date and available when needed.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To make automations and workflows more effective make sure that high-impact use cases are prioritized. The automations should be intuitive and transparent meaning these should minimize clicks and decision points and should provide visibility of the status of the ongoing tasks. Further, these should be designed to integrate across systems and should have embedded intelligence to provide improved outcomes based on data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;It is important to regularly measure and optimize automations. Have governance in place and finally promote the adoption by offering training and support.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;To conclude, I recommend reading &lt;A href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.sap.com%2Ft5%2Fuser%2Fviewprofilepage%2Fuser-id%2F202409&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjuhi.kulshreshtha%40mindsprint.org%7Cc9245b5db37f49182f1108ddd9b12fdf%7C5e007b6c258b4fdeadc18bf8a135885d%7C0%7C0%7C638906077320345540%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=pgIWRxwLEkmYbOJcN5djJ%2Brsq3emC9vO%2FBs6XP33Bhk%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Michael Ameling's&lt;/A&gt; blog on &lt;A href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.sap.com%2Ft5%2Ftechnology-blog-posts-by-sap%2Fjoule-studio-is-generally-available-in-sap-build-empower-your-business-with%2Fba-p%2F14137882&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjuhi.kulshreshtha%40mindsprint.org%7Cc9245b5db37f49182f1108ddd9b12fdf%7C5e007b6c258b4fdeadc18bf8a135885d%7C0%7C0%7C638906077320366786%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=0AplbSSJcXFFcqtqqGVoXGdSGGSzCArTw7yqWECZ%2BYE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Procurement and HR leaders are expected to deliver more—faster, smarter, and with greater accountability—but they’re often constrained by outdated, manual workflows that lag the pace of change.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The rise of hybrid work, the surge in contingent labor, and the growing complexity of services procurement have created a perfect storm of operational friction. As pressure mounts to optimize spend, ensure compliance, and secure the right talent at the right time, the disconnect between executive expectations and system capabilities becomes increasingly clear — tools in place often deliver fragmentation, delays, and administrative burden. It’s no longer enough to simply digitize workflows. Executives are demanding real-time visibility, streamlined execution, and actionable insights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The current mandate is shifting from basic automation to intelligent orchestration powered by AI and copilots. Enterprise systems are no longer just expected to process tasks—they must evolve to anticipate user needs, guide decision-making, and unlock capacity at scale. Reflecting this shift, &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2025/05/506790af-067f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;44% of executives identify AI strategy and integration as a top priority&lt;/A&gt; for procurement teams over the next 12–18 months&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As a leader in external workforce, SAP Fieldglass has taken a disciplined, strategic approach to artificial intelligence—one that prioritizes trust, transparency, and tangible business value. Focusing on deeply and seamlessly embedding it in the systems that power external workforce management. Delivering intelligence that understands the complexity of enterprise operations, respects data integrity, and scales with confidence. SAP Fieldglass’s AI is helping businesses run better by turning data into decisions, and decisions into outcomes. That’s what makes its approach essential for organisations navigating transformation at scale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule and the Power of GenAI: Embedded Intelligence for Every Workflow&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The launch of Joule, SAP’s copilot, within SAP Fieldglass marks a transformative moment for organizations seeking to elevate their contingent labor and services procurement strategies. Joule is not just another tool—it’s a strategic enabler that redefines how practitioners interact with data, make decisions, and drive operational excellence.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule introduces a conversational interface that allows users to interact with SAP Fieldglass in a natural, intuitive way. By shifting from manual navigation to intelligent dialogue executives and managers can now receive assistance with everyday tedious tasks – including multiple search and navigation enhancements, as well as assistance in the creation of job postings and SOWs – within contingent and Statement of Work (SOW) workflows, simply by engaging through a conversational interface.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For users focused on speed and scale, Joule delivers a powerful suite of capabilities that streamline decision-making and execution:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It guides users to best-fit templates and intelligently pre-fills key fields such as start dates.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It retrieves complex reports—like quarterly budget and spend, worker headcount, and job postings—with ease.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It quickly surfaces relevant help information from the SAP Help Portal site and actionable insights that would otherwise take hours to uncover.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Together, these capabilities dramatically reduce time-to-action, minimize manual errors, accelerate the learning curve, and improve the overall user experience. Joule also enhances visibility and precision in workforce planning, empowering users to make informed decisions around vendor spend, talent allocation, and compliance risks.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule is integrated directly into SAP Fieldglass, so it eliminates the need to toggle between systems or undergo extensive training, allowing teams to focus on outcomes rather than processes. This frictionless experience is particularly appealing to executives who value simplicity and efficiency in enterprise technology.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Security and scalability are foundational to Joule’s design. Built within SAP’s trusted ecosystem, it adheres to rigorous governance standards, ensuring that innovation does not compromise compliance or unconscious bias. For organizations operating across geographies and industries, this means they can deploy Joule with confidence, knowing it meets the highest standards of data protection and operational integrity.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fieldglass AI journey&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fieldglass has been at the forefront of integrating machine learning and artificial intelligence into its solutions for years. From intelligent resume assessments and skill-based candidate matching to automated job description creation, translation, and even SOW generation, SAP has consistently delivered AI-driven capabilities that enhance talent management and procurement processes. These innovations reflect a broader, ongoing commitment to embedding intelligence across the SAP ecosystem—an evolution that continues with the integration of Joule.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Fieldglass SOW Document AI is an intelligent document processing solution that streamlines the management of Statement of Work (SOW) documents within the SAP Fieldglass platform. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, it automates the extraction, classification, and validation of key data from SOW PDFs, such as job roles, deliverables, durations, and financial terms. This reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and accelerates the onboarding and management of external workforce engagements. By integrating seamlessly with the Fieldglass ecosystem, SOW Document AI enhances compliance, improves data accuracy, and helps organizations make faster, more informed decisions when managing services procurement.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In conclusion&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Looking ahead, Joule will include deeper analytics and expanded use cases across the SAP Business AI portfolio. This evolution will further empower leaders to harness AI in ways that are strategic, scalable, and deeply aligned with their organizational priorities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For executives ready to lead this transformation, Joule offers a unique opportunity to reimagine how work gets done. It’s not just about automation—it’s about unlocking new levels of insight, speed, and strategic control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP helps bring simplicity and clarity to all types of spending from all across a company. SAP invites customers and partners to take part in the transformation, shaping the future of intelligent workforce management together, so that you can take a step toward a smarter, more agile workforce.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Interested to learn more or activate Joule in your environment?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Reach out to your an SAP representative or &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/registration/contact.html?product=73554900100700001921&amp;amp;productName=SAP+Ariba+Procurement&amp;amp;topicarea=Solutions&amp;amp;campaigncode=CRM-YD24-ISM-2422141&amp;amp;source=event-glo-ISBNAIOct2024" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Contact us today &lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please refer to the following screenshots&amp;nbsp;for more details of the use cases&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;1) Joule - Job Posting Template Selection&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Joule - SOW Create.jpg" style="width: 791px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301226i9AFD7AFD67B589BF/image-dimensions/791x563?v=v2" width="791" height="563" role="button" title="Joule - SOW Create.jpg" alt="Joule - SOW Create.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule - Report Search and Execution&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Joule Report search and execution.png" style="width: 792px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301225i961B18E905E7BA46/image-dimensions/792x446?v=v2" width="792" height="446" role="button" title="Joule Report search and execution.png" alt="Joule Report search and execution.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3)&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule - Help Retrieval&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Joule - Help Retrieval.jpg" style="width: 784px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/301227iE47E7EA51EFAB3F5/image-dimensions/784x767?v=v2" width="784" height="767" role="button" title="Joule - Help Retrieval.jpg" alt="Joule - Help Retrieval.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

You've implemented many applications required for your business, collected vast amounts of data, and are now hopefully looking into utilizing various AI tools. Yet when you want to optimize business processes, increase sales, engage customers, and elevate employee experience, you’re lost on where to start.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Sound familiar? The challenge isn't technology—it's the strategic alignment of &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;and &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/canada/products/data-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Data Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;with real business objectives. You're sitting on a goldmine of data, but the path to extracting value feels fragmented across different systems, departments, and decision-making processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-1602920462"&gt;The key lies in creating an intelligent, unified ecosystem where your &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP and non-SAP data&lt;/STRONG&gt;, applications, and &lt;STRONG&gt;AI capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt; work in harmony. &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, coupled with &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP BDC&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; doesn't just solve technical challenges—it fundamentally reshapes how your organization thinks, learns, and competes in the market.&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1148241519"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What Makes This Summit Different: Customer-Led Innovation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Unlike typical vendor conferences, the &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Platform and Data Summit&lt;/STRONG&gt; puts &lt;STRONG&gt;customer success stories&lt;/STRONG&gt; at the center. You'll hear directly from &lt;STRONG&gt;IT decision-makers&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;business leaders&lt;/STRONG&gt; who have navigated similar challenges you're facing today. These aren't theoretical case studies—they're battle-tested strategies with real business value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The &lt;STRONG&gt;two-day format&lt;/STRONG&gt; is intentionally designed for deep engagement. Day 1 focuses on hearing from customers and partners’ success stories, while Day 2 dives into collaborative workshops to learn and ideate. You'll leave not just with inspiration, but with concrete next steps tailored to your organization's unique &lt;STRONG&gt;digital transformation journey&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-951728014"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Four Essential Topic Tracks You'll Explore at the Summit&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;On Day 2, dedicated tracks are offered to address the most pressing challenges facing organizations today in a workshop setting. Each track combines strategic insights with practical implementation guidance from customers who have successfully navigated these transformations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;BTP for Clean Core&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;You:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Your organization is managing a complex landscape of customizations that make system upgrades challenging and expensive.

With its intuitive design and AI-driven functionality, Joule is not just an assistant—it’s a strategic partner for every business user.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/382ChL5?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1166611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_1-1755705303670.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303112iCF154B51114000E6/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_1-1755705303670.png" alt="sangdao_1-1755705303670.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Simplifying Service Contract Management with Joule for Business &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_2-1755705303683.png" style="width: 535px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303113i6C38FAD8312EDE1C/image-dimensions/535x301?v=v2" width="535" height="301" role="button" title="sangdao_2-1755705303683.png" alt="sangdao_2-1755705303683.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For Customer Service Managers, &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Business&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a game-changer. It allows managers to express their business needs using everyday language, eliminating the need for specialized technical knowledge. Joule then guides users directly to key service management applications, such as the Manage Service Contracts app, Service Management Overview, and Service Contracts Dashboard. The result? Users experience faster navigation, enhanced satisfaction, and improved operational efficiency. By providing seamless access to apps like Mass Processing of Service Contracts and Monitor Auto Renewal Logs, Joule ensures that service contract management becomes a streamlined and user-friendly process.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Streamlining Solution Order Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_3-1755705303695.png" style="width: 539px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303115i54E6F51C6CA8281D/image-dimensions/539x303?v=v2" width="539" height="303" role="button" title="sangdao_3-1755705303695.png" alt="sangdao_3-1755705303695.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule for Business&lt;/STRONG&gt; also empowers Solution Order Specialists to work more effectively.

With its AI-powered sales order status check, Joule enables businesses to monitor whether sales orders are on track and identify any issues hindering fulfillment. By translating complex fulfillment statuses into plain language, Joule helps users quickly understand bottlenecks, view potential causes, receive resolution suggestions, and seamlessly navigate to the appropriate applications.

It achieves this by providing instant guidance grounded in an unmatched knowledge base that is exclusive to SAP and expertly curated. This foundation includes over 200,000 pages of documentation, SAP Notes, Knowledge Base Articles, and terabytes of content from SAP Communities. By tapping into this authoritative source, consultants can get fast, specific answers to complex questions, supporting every phase of a project from discover to run and saving up to 1.5 hours per day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Beyond its extensive knowledge base, Joule offers powerful SAP-specific code intelligence, built upon a fine-tuned model trained on 250 million lines of ABAP code.

One of the standout features of this release is the introduction of AI-generated explanations for fixed asset key figures.

This advanced AI feature revolutionizes the handling of incoming quality certificates, significantly enhancing operational efficiency for our customers. By automating the extraction of relevant information from both paper and digital documents and incorporating it into SAP workflows, SAP Document AI streamlines the processing of supplier quality certificates. This leads to substantial reductions in manual efforts, faster processing times, and minimized human errors. As a result, quality technicians are liberated from monotonous tasks, enabling them to concentrate on more strategic and value-adding activities, which, in turn, helps companies expedite stock releases, minimize inspection-related production delays, and enhance overall throughput.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Moreover, SAP Document AI enhances accuracy and reliability by automatically matching quality certificates with system records and updating their status, ensuring that no document is misplaced and compliance is consistently maintained. Additionally, intelligent error handling fortifies system resilience and trust. One of the most compelling features of this solution is its seamless integration into the SAP S/4HANA Cloud experience, offered as a ready-to-use capability that requires no custom development, thereby providing customers with immediate value and swift ROI. As we continue to incorporate AI, data, and automation into our ERP offerings, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition serves as a cornerstone for smarter, more agile operations. The introduction of SAP Document AI exemplifies our commitment to supporting customers in future-proofing their business, driving continuous improvement, and fostering innovation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-294871198"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2.4. Unlock seamless data access with AI-assisted easy enterprise search&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/ViV9bhN?rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1166515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_10-1755705303863.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303122i96EFB48D08DF0F65/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_10-1755705303863.png" alt="sangdao_10-1755705303863.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Accessing business data is now even more intuitive with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-assisted easy enterprise search&lt;/STRONG&gt;, which allows users to search using natural language. Instead of navigating through complex structures, a simple query like “Show me sales orders overall status in process” or “Show me open sales orders that have a net value greater than 100 EUR” provides relevant results instantly.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system adapts the search results based on the user’s role, ensuring that only the most relevant business objects are presented. This not only improves search accuracy but also accelerates insight extraction—making it easier to act quickly and confidently in a data-rich environment. To enable this feature, select the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;'enable AI natural language search' &lt;/EM&gt;checkbox in the user profile settings.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--30725026"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;3.

AI-assisted smart solution for situations in My Home&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/tSpQrWC?ltr=v&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1206840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sangdao_11-1755705303878.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303121i869846807142FB0B/image-size/medium?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="sangdao_11-1755705303878.png" alt="sangdao_11-1755705303878.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2508 release brings a new dimension of intelligence to the user experience with the introduction of the&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI-assisted smart solution for situations in My Home&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Currently available in beta testing, this innovative feature simplifies the resolution of business-critical situations by dynamically guiding users through resolution steps—directly from the homepage.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This smart solution leverages generative AI to adapt the user interface in real time, presenting timely insights and suggested actions tailored to the specific business context. Designed to support fast, informed decisions, it transforms traditionally manual and multi-step tasks into a seamless, click-efficient experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Accessible from the SAP S/4HANA Cloud homepage, the solution enables situation handling in just a few clicks—significantly reducing the time and effort required to take action. Instead of navigating through multiple screens, users are presented with&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;dynamic cards&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;that surface key information and associated actions. These cards act as entry points to resolve issues directly, eliminating the need for in-depth navigation and enhancing day-to-day productivity.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The substantial benefits of this innovation include saving time, reducing complexity, and improving the quality of decision-making. Generative AI delivers context-aware recommendations and outcomes that are both trustworthy and relevant—built on enterprise-grade intelligence. This intuitive approach allows users to act confidently with minimal effort, ultimately boosting overall efficiency across key operational processes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To illustrate its impact, consider a common example: a sales representative receives a notification that a sales quotation is about to expire. In a conventional workflow, the user would open the situation, navigate to the quotation, manually edit the details, save the changes, and then return to resolve the situation. With the AI-assisted solution in My Home, these steps are consolidated into a single, streamlined flow—demonstrating how user effort is minimized while responsiveness is maximized.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Join the SAP beta testing for the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/3910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;latest AI-assisted user experience features in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.

Currently in beta testing, it allows users to tailor their applications and insight tiles using natural language.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Applications can be added in just two clicks, including a preview to confirm suitability. This streamlines customization, especially for new or infrequent users, by offering AI-powered suggestions, application descriptions, and live KPIs for dynamic tiles. The experience is intuitive and efficient, ensuring that personalization aligns with users’ daily workflows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Interested in experiencing these improvements first-hand?

    <content>&lt;P&gt;Are you ready to influence the future of tax localization in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;We’re inviting customers to participate in the beta testing program for a new Joule capability:&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Understanding Tax Calculations&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="KedarMuzumdar_0-1755777280805.jpeg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/303518i5F31D0B1F080606B/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="KedarMuzumdar_0-1755777280805.jpeg" alt="KedarMuzumdar_0-1755777280805.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This feature, available for early access with release &lt;STRONG&gt;2508&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;.2&lt;/STRONG&gt;, uses Generative AI to deliver real-time, contextual explanations of tax logic applied in posted sales orders. The current scope focuses on&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Sales Order-based tax calculations for India&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Billing clerks often spend valuable time interpreting tax rules to ensure compliance. This capability simplifies that process by providing clear, human-readable insights—directly within the application. The result: faster reviews, fewer errors, and greater confidence in tax accuracy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a beta participant, you’ll test the feature in your own SAP S/4HANA Cloud system and engage in regular feedback sessions with SAP’s development teams. Your input will directly shape how this AI-powered localization tool evolves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Dates&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Registration: July 1 – September 30, 2025&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Program Start: October 20, 2025&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Duration: 90 days&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Seats are limited. To participate, you must be an SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition customer or partner and sign a Test Evaluation Agreement.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ready to get involved?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Check out the &lt;A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/3981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beta Testing program page&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; and click the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Register&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;button at the top left to secure your spot.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We’re thrilled to announce a major enhancement to the &lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/roadmapviewer/group/658F507A-D6F5-4B78-9EE1-0300C5F1E40F/roadmapcontentpage/56a072afc5fe4cf5a3a8d2cdb0b75c53" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Activate Roadmap for SAP Business Technology Platform&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt;- it now includes &lt;STRONG&gt;end-to-end guidance for implementing SAP Integration Suite capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This update brings clear, actionable direction for managing integration projects from start to finish. Even better, the content is aligned with SAP’s Integration Solution Advisory Methodology (ISA-M) - SAP’s strategic framework for building and managing enterprise integration effectively.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And now, with the &lt;STRONG&gt;integration of Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;, accessing and consuming roadmap content has become an even more &lt;STRONG&gt;intelligent and user-friendly experience&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What’s New&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With this roadmap expansion, organizations gain structured guidance to plan, implement, and govern their integration architecture on SAP BTP. This includes support for both new integrations and migration from legacy solutions - all while applying best practices from ISA-M.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whether you're beginning your cloud journey or optimizing existing integrations, this content helps you move forward with clarity, governance, and agility.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In today’s complex landscapes, integration is critical — and often underestimated. The enhanced roadmap supports integration leaders, enterprise architects, and project teams with a structured, phase-by-phase approach to reduce risk, align teams, and accelerate outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By embedding ISA-M principles throughout each phase, the roadmap ensures that integration strategy remains aligned with business priorities, clean core principles, and SAP’s reference architectures.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Updated SAP Activate for SAP BTP Phases with Integration Content:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Discover&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Define your integration vision and scope, aligning business needs with strategic planning. Set the stage for a structured integration journey.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prepare&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Establish governance, form key teams, enable stakeholders, and assess your current integration landscape. Lay the technical and organizational groundwork.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Explore&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Set up the SAP BTP environment and activate Integration Suite. Design your integration architecture, Define Best Practices, and prepare for testing.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Realize&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Develop and migrate integrations, implement DevOps and transport processes, and run detailed testing. Prepare for cutover and operations support.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deploy&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Go live with the SAP BTP solution, execute cutover plans, and transition to support. Resolve outstanding issues for a stable launch.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Run&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Operate your solution efficiently and continuously improve. Leverage SAP BTP and Integration Suite innovations to evolve with business needs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://me.sap.com/roadmapviewer/group/658F507A-D6F5-4B78-9EE1-0300C5F1E40F/roadmapcontentpage/56a072afc5fe4cf5a3a8d2cdb0b75c53" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Tag_Image.jpg" style="width: 730px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/304431i00791ECC5F1E5A73/image-dimensions/730x637/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="730" height="637" role="button" title="Tag_Image.jpg" alt="Tag_Image.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule: An Intelligent Way to Access SAP Activate&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To make the roadmap even more accessible, &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Activate for SAP BTP now includes Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt; - a digital copilot embedded into SAP’s ecosystem.

Joule uses a conversational interface to help users complete tasks efficiently. It leverages generative and other AI technologies to understand natural language requests, identify intent, perform actions, and provide insights. Using generative AI, it can execute tasks, deliver tailored responses, and summarize information effectively.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;(IMPORTANT: AI Copilot Joule in&amp;nbsp;SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle and Performance&amp;nbsp;will be in early access until September 19th, 2025, at which time it will be made generally available to customers.)&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Displaying Comments when Updates are Requested for a Modular Questionnaire (SLP-2272)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Modular questionnaires allow continuous updates or permanently close after the submitted answers are first approved or denied. Requesting an update reopens the questionnaire so that the recipient can update it once. When you request an update to a modular questionnaire and enter an (optional) comment about the update request, the comment along with its timestamp is now displayed in the Comments section of the modular questionnaire.For example, the comment is displayed in this manner: "UserXYZ has requested an update for questionnaireABC".&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Risk Exposure Summary Report Displays Overall Residual and Inherent Risk Levels (SRISK-1763)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This feature provides information about the inherent and residual risk levels of suppliers in the Risk Exposure Summary report. This crucial information aids in making informed decisions when engaging with suppliers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In addition to the existing risk exposure information, the Risk Exposure Summary report now includes two additional columns to provide inherent and residual risk level information for the suppliers you monitor in SAP Ariba Supplier Risk.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Changes to the User Interface -&amp;nbsp;Currently, the Risk Exposure Summary report summarizes the overall risk exposure, and category-wise risk exposure such as legal and regulatory, environmental and social, and operational risk exposure. This enhancement introduces two additional columns to display overall inherent risk level and residual risk level information for the suppliers you monitor in SAP Ariba Supplier Risk.&lt;/P&gt;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This sixth post in my series gives an overview of user experience innovations in SAP Customer Experience and SAP Concur. For SAP Customer Experience, look at the new AI agents and the capability to build custom agents, plus AI innovations for marketeers in SAP Emarsys, and Joule and AI order summaries in SAP Sales Cloud Version 2. &amp;nbsp;SAP Concur takes travel planning to the next level with the whole new travel experience, complemented by the new Joule Booking Agent enabling users to use natural language to book a trip.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before reading this, do read the first blog post introducing the series and providing general information about Joule and central entry points and services, along with links to all the published parts of this blog post series:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1609675603"&gt;SAP Customer Experience&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;The user experience highlights I have picked are all AI-related:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;AI Agents.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Emarsys UX innovations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Sales Cloud Version 2 UX innovations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This news article summarizes what’s new overall for SAP Customer Experience, beyond UX-related innovations:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://news.sap.com/2025/07/connected-growth-sap-cx-q2-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Connected for Growth: What’s New with SAP Customer Experience in Q2 2025&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1542244817"&gt;AI Agents&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As I explained in part 1 of this series, AI agents work in the background to give a greatly enhanced user experience. A number of powerful AI agents are available for SAP Customer Experience, via the package &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ai-catalog/?packages=cc485586-3c5c-427b-a3d1-12b0bb138229&amp;amp;aiType=ai_agent_package" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Joule Premium for Customer Experience&lt;/A&gt;. This blog post and video give a nice overview of three of them in action:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/ai-agents-in-action/ba-p/14073817" target="_blank"&gt;AI Agents in Action&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Video: &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2025/01/b8dba82e-f27e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;See How AI Agents Streamline Customer Service&lt;/A&gt; (3:11 min.)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The latest UX innovations are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Shopping Agent for the Shopping Assistant.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Digital Service Agent (via Early Adopter Care program).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ability to create custom agents in the CX AI Toolkit.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1474814031"&gt;AI Shopping Agent for the SAP Commerce Cloud Shopping Assistant&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;The shopping agent helps customers when visiting an online shop: they can simply use natural language to state what they are looking for, and the shopping agent will respond with suitable suggestions. Figure 1 shows an example, where the user starts out by stating that they are looking for shoes to wear for two mile long walks while wearing a suit. Two shoes are suggested, and the user asks which one is comfortable right away, since he doesn’t want a long break in period. The agent recommends one model, and the customer then asks for a recommendation for a belt to match, which the agent promptly gives him.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: Shopping Agent for the Shopping Assistant from SAP Commerce Cloud.

It enables customers to ask questions with natural language and provides answers based on your company’s business knowledge residing in the SAP system. Hence, it is able to resolve common inquiries and issues, giving customers a good experience. Furthermore, by freeing up you sales and service team to focus on more complex inquiries, your customers will also receive a better service and hence better experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The digital serice agent is currently only available for select customers via the Early Adopter Care program. Figure 2 in the next section shows how these customers can select it in the AI Agent Builder.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Find out more here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Discovery Center: &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ai-feature/9bd66628-12f0-46f7-b9d7-ce4ff725a946/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Digital Service Agent&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1081787021"&gt;Create Custom Agents with CX AI Toolkit&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can now create your own custom agents with the CX AI toolkit.

And if you just need to book one item, you can do that very easily now with the new Booking Agent powered by Joule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--468662886"&gt;New Concur Travel Experience&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;When travelling for a few days, one often needs to book more than one item. A typical combination is booking a flight, a hotel and a rental car. Up until now, you have had to book each item separately and take care that the dates and time match. Now, with the new Concur Travel experience, planning and booking is much easier: you can enter the start and end dates for your flight, and the new feature &lt;EM&gt;Match Flight Booking&lt;/EM&gt; is applied to the hotel and car, so that dates and time match automatically.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Figures 7 to 11 show what this looks like: Figure 7 shows the start screen, where you select which items you want to include (flight, hotel, car, train). Figure 8 shows the flight view, where flight dates have been entered. Figure 9 shows the hotel search, with the default selection “Based on flight selection”, and similarly Figure 10 shows the rental car search, with pick-up and return times calculated based on the flight schedule. Figure 11 shows the finalize screen, in this case showing that the flight and hotel has been selected but the rental car is still open.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 7: New Concur Travel experience start screen.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This seventh and last post in my series gives an overview innovations in our UI tools and technologies, making it ever easier to design, build and integrate UIs, for both web and mobile applications. For designing apps, web and mobile, we have a new SAP Design System portal and UI Kits in Figma. For developers, we have added further AI assistance, as well as many individual improvements, including support for the latest international accessibility standard WCAG 2.2. &lt;EM&gt;Fun fact: SAPUI5 is now used on all 7 continents – yes, Antarctica too!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before reading this, do read the first blog post introducing the series and providing general information about Joule and central entry points and services, along with links to all the published parts of this blog post series:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-ux-q3-2025-update-part-1-ai-joule-sap-build-work-zone-sap-mobile-start/ba-p/14161847" target="_blank"&gt;SAP UX Q3/2025 Update – Part 1: AI, Joule, SAP Build Work Zone, SAP Mobile Start&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;The above post also gives an update on building your own Joule agents, so I will not cover that here, but rather focus on web and mobile UI development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1609793836"&gt;Design News&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1542363050"&gt;SAP Design System Portal and UI Kits in Figma&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;We recently introduced the new &lt;A href="http://www.sap.com/design-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Design System portal&lt;/A&gt; &lt;SPAN&gt;that &lt;/SPAN&gt;brings together the product design guidelines SAP Fiori for web, SAP Fiori for iOS, and SAP Fiori for Android, as well as to the new digital design system guidelines. With its enhanced usability, simplified versioning and improved performance, designers (and developers!) get a better user experience compared with the previous SAP Fiori design guidelines.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1: The SAP Design System portal start page.

Adopting the latest standards gives applications a true cutting edge, ensuring that solutions are inclusive and meet the diverse needs of users globally.&amp;nbsp;When creating apps with SAP Build and SAPUI5, developers can leverage the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, two of the key new requirements in the 2.2 version are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The minimum target size of an interactive element now needs to be 24x24 px, so that users don’t accidentally activate a neighbouring element.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Each operation that can be performed by dragging can also be performed alternatively without dragging – so that people who cannot use a mouse to drag can still use the UI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;See more details:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sapui5-is-leading-the-way-in-accessibility-with-wcag-2-2/ba-p/14101596" target="_blank"&gt;SAPUI5 is Leading the Way in Accessibility with WCAG 2.2&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-166768515"&gt;SAP Fiori tools – open source, faster app creation, more AI&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;One of the most powerful recent innovations is the AI-powered project accelerator from SAP Fiori tools, which allows you to create a fully functional app with database tables, CDS-Views, OData service and a Fiori element list report UI based on a sketch of what you want. I introduced this in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-user-experience-q1-2025-update-part-7-ui-design-and-technology-for-web/ba-p/14034290" target="_blank"&gt;my Q1 update post&lt;/A&gt; from March. This can now be started from Joule in SAP Build Code. Also, it has been further enhanced, and is also available as open source, so that our developer community can make contributions themselves.

I have picked two enhancements to highlight here for developers using SAPUI5 and SAP Fiori elements on OData V4, which are covered in the following subsections:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support for inline edit for object pages.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Support for the analytical table on the object page.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId--172407145"&gt;Support for inline edit for object pages&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can now develop object pages where users can directly edit fields within facets, without having to first press the “Edit” button and go into edit mode. Figure 5 shows an example from a test application.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 5: Inline editing of fields in an object page with SAP Fiori elements for OData V4.

Now, developers using SAPUI5 and SAP Fiori elements on OData V4 can include an analytical table into one of the facets of an object page. Figure 6 shows an example.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 6: Analytical table in an object page with SAP Fiori elements for OData V4.

    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1609830569"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;はじめに&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP の生成AIアシスタント&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Joule&amp;nbsp;には、Document Grounding の機能が提供されています。これにより、社内の業務ドキュメントの内容を元に迅速で的確な回答を生成できるようになります。例えば、従業員が社内ポリシーやマニュアルについて質問した際、Jouleは大規模言語モデルの知識だけでなく、会社内に保存された関連ドキュメントの内容を参照して回答します。従来この Document Grounding 機能は Microsoft SharePoint をデータソースとしてサポートしていましたが、SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition&amp;nbsp;上のコンテンツも参照可能になりました。SAP Build Work Zone 上のワークスペースのパブリックコンテンツ&lt;SPAN&gt;（全ユーザーに公開されたドキュメントやページ）をJouleの提供する回答のソース情報として利用できるようになるため、社内ナレッジをより活用した回答が期待できます。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;本記事では、&lt;/SPAN&gt;SAP Build Work Zone をドキュメントリポジトリとして設定し、Jouleのドキュメントグラウンディングを有効化する手順&lt;SPAN&gt;を解説します。これにより SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition 内に格納したPDFやWordファイル、ナレッジベース記事などをインデックス化し、ユーザーの質問に対してそれらのファイルの内容に基づく回答を Joule が生成できるようになります。なお、本記事の読者は SAP BTP や SAP Build Work Zone の基本的な知識を有していることを前提とします。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1413317064"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;前提条件&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;本手順を開始する前に、以下の準備が整っていることを確認してください。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP BTP 環境と Joule のセットアップ:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP BTP のグローバルアカウントおよびサブアカウントがあり、Joule のサブスクリプションが有効になっていること。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP Build Work Zone, advanced editionが利用可能で、サイトが初期セットアップ済みであること。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;アイデンティティと認証基盤:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP Cloud Identity Services (Identity Authentication) でシングルサインオン基盤が整備され、Jouleと統合製品（SAP Build Work Zone）間で&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;グローバルユーザーID&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;（user UUID）が共有されていること。Joule導入時にIdentity Authenticationの信頼関係を設定済みであること。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Build Work Zone 管理者権限:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP Build Work Zone の管理コンソールにアクセスでき、機能の有効化や設定変更を行える管理者ユーザーとしてログインできる。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;以上の前提を満たした上で、以下に示す手順に従って設定を行います。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1216803559"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;全体構成図&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;公式なSAP Help Portalのセットアップガイドから、全体の俯瞰図を描いてみると以下のような形になると考えられます。&lt;BR /&gt;なお、こちらは個人的な見解であり、情報の正当性には細心の注意を払ってください。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;【随時、更新します】&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1020290054"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;手順&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;今回は下記のSAP Help Portalの手順に則った上でセットアップを進めていきます。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;GitHub上に手順をまとめたスクリプトを用意していますので、ぜひご活用ください。ただし、正確な手順はSAP Help Portalに準じます。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;まずは下記の通り、GitHub上のリポジトリをクローンしましょう。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/watwatwhat/document-grounding-setup.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="takayuki_tanaka_0-1756455578387.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/306278iEEE3A665335C6058/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="takayuki_tanaka_0-1756455578387.png" alt="takayuki_tanaka_0-1756455578387.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;下記コマンドを実行して、セットアップガイドスクリプトを起動しましょう。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-bash"&gt;&lt;code&gt;./main.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;このガイドは、インタラクティブに手順を実行することができるように設計されています。1~12までを順次選択しながら進んで行きましょう。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-952859268"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Document Grounding サービスの有効化&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;まず、SAP BTP上で Document Grounding のサービスインスタンスを作成します。このサービスがJouleで社内ドキュメントを取り扱うための技術的な基盤となります。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;まずはセットアップガイドスクリプトを起動し、メニューから 「1.

Edition&amp;nbsp;に保存された社内ドキュメントをデータソースとして、Joule のドキュメントグラウンディング機能を設定できました。これにより、ユーザーがJouleに対して行う質問に対し、Work Zone内のファイル（PDFやWord文書など）の内容を根拠にした回答が生成されるようになります。たとえば社内規程集のPDFをWork Zoneにアップロードしパブリックに公開しておけば、Jouleに規程の詳細を尋ねた際にそのPDFから回答が引用されるようになります。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;社内ナレッジを有効活用することで、Jouleの回答精度向上や信頼性の高い情報提供が期待できます。ただし前述の通り、現在この機能ではドキュメントがテナント内の全ユーザーにとって参照可能な情報源となる点に留意し、公開して問題ない情報のみをアップロードしてください。機能拡張により将来的にはユーザー権限に応じた応答制御なども行われる可能性があります。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;最後に、設定に際して不明点があればSAPヘルプの公式ドキュメント（Integrating Joule with SAP Solutions内の 「Set Up Document Grounding」 節や、SAP Build Work Zone, advanced editionの「Integration With Document Grounding」ガイド）を参照してください。最新情報や制約事項が更新されている場合があります。本記事の手順を参考に、自社環境でJouleとWork Zoneを連携させ、社内文書に基づく高度なQ&amp;amp;Aシステムを活用してみてください。&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1

Further, the pricing of J4C allows even small partners to get going without having to make huge investments and commitments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Here are six frequent questions I experience partners are asking:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Do I need to make a big purchase at SAP to get going with Joule for consultants?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;No.&amp;nbsp; With the new PUPM pricing, the minimum purchase requirement is one user.&amp;nbsp; You pay for it by SAP AI units, which has a minimum purchase requirement of 100 AI units (with a list price of 700 euro).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;And with the new “per month” commercial strategy, you can assign/commit J4C users on monthly basis, not yearly basis.&amp;nbsp; For example, you could potentially start with 1 user for a couple of months. &amp;nbsp;This limits your initial investment but allows you to start gain value and experiences with the tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Is there a Test, Development and Demo (TDD) for Joule for consultants?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;No.&amp;nbsp; The “test” word in “TDD” is meant for partners to test customer topics in SAP LOB solutions, to be able to support customers as part of SAP’s offerings.&amp;nbsp; The situation with J4C is very different: partners will mainly use it themselves in a productive manner related to their own offerings (implementation services).&amp;nbsp; In this case, a partner as a professional service company is actually a customer of SAP.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;That is why J4C is only available on the (productive) customer price list&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;As a partner, do I need to run an SAP LOB solution productively to install and use J4C?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;No.&amp;nbsp; J4C can run stand-alone, running on a sub account of your global BTP account.&amp;nbsp; Your consultants will get a URL directly to the BTP J4C instance.&amp;nbsp; You do not need to run any other productive or TDD system from SAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Do I need to run a separate instance of J4C for each of my subsidiaries, or can I run it on one global instance?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;You can run it on global level. As J4C is a stand alone solution (thus not related to existing TDD or productive systems), you can potentially run it on global level and provide your world wide consultants with the URL to access it. But note that you need to maintain these users in the IAS instance on SAP BTP where J4C is installed for them to get access to the tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is the best target profile of a resource to use J4C?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;The main target is functional and technical implementation consultants, resources who implement and provide support on SAP solutions to customers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; For example, junior consultants often need to learn a lot, they can ask J4C instead of reaching out to senior consultants who often are very busy and hard to get whole of.&amp;nbsp; Senior consultants can benefit from J4C by finding super specific information fast.&amp;nbsp; They can also benefit when doing something new at customers.&amp;nbsp; And they can be ensured they are up to date with the latest changes in SAP for a specific functional topic and following best practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Can I sell J4C to my customers? Some of my customers have internal SAP IT departments and/or power users who could benefit.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Yes. You can sell SAP AI units SKU 8019164 to your customers and they can start the activation process of J4C via SAP-for-me. At the moment selling the needed AI Units is possible in a CCFlex motion. Resell motion will become available second half of September.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Summary&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;In my opinion, starting with J4C is within reach of each SAP partner, and each partner should start on the journey to leverage the tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;When acquiring J4C, it is important that you as partner know how to purchase AI units, where you what to run J4C (many partners has multiple SAP accounts etc), &amp;nbsp;you need to understand how to request activation in SAP-for-me, understand how the consumption of the AI units works, and you need to understand how to set J4C up SAP BTP.&amp;nbsp; For guidance on all these topics, please &lt;A class="" href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/assets/solutions/dgl/25/70/SAP1222570.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;see this document.&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This blog is not written by any LLM.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Well, to start with, Joule for Developers, let us understand what it is?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Many people have a misconception that Joule for Developers or J4D is just an ABAP AI capability. But it is much more beyond ABAP. Joule for Developers(J4D) is&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;collective name for the AI-powered design-time capabilities across SAP Build and ABAP&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;It includes new and existing features enabled by Joule in:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Build Code&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Build Apps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;ABAP in SAP BTP and S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;These capabilities help developers build faster, code smarter, and automate better. Is that true? I will my honest opinion for some of them.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I have personally worked on SAP Build Code and Joule for Developers, ABAP AI. I started with a lot of ambiguity and finally I made a mark that I could now explain it to our customers and users.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP Build Code, has evolved through multiple iterations and seems it is still evolving.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Created Fiori element app using Image&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Created a series of projects with prompts&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Created test data&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;With ABAP AI, I could create a report with the suggestions popping up in run time and that too contextually aware code prompts also known to be predictive code completion feature. We called it Ghost Code. But trust me sometimes they are really good too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I see the ABAP and CDS unit scripts getting generated in no time. It was good again on this parameter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Code explain, well I created small projects, hence feel it is good to have comments. But the true colors will be visible when you look at the repository of thousands lines of code written by someone and you have no clue of what it is. Using your skills you debug the code to understand what each block/function is doing. &lt;STRONG&gt;It is a life saver in this scenario.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Well this will be an evolving document, where I will keep updating my reviews on each of these services mentioned. Stay tuned!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;You can refer to the following blogs in this context:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/unlock-sap-joule-for-developers-claim-your-free-access-today/ba-p/14183158" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/unlock-sap-joule-for-developers-claim-your-free-access-today/ba-p/14183158&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;We are happy to announce that Joule integration with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition is now available in Cloud Integration Automation service as one of the integration scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule, being the next generation AI copilot from SAP, it is important for SAP to make Joule provisioning and setup easy and automated for its customers. Joule is available for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition within &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/rise.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;RISE with SAP&lt;/A&gt;. The existing manual integration process is complex, time consuming and the whole integration process takes weeks if not months, but thanks to the automation capabilities provided by the Cloud Integration Automation service, the Joule integration set up is now much simpler and faster.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By leveraging the Cloud Integration Automation service (offered as a service within BTP) at no additional cost, setting up Joule in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition is now considerably faster, simpler, and more reliable. This service allows for the automation of number of integration steps, significantly reducing the overall integration effort for SAP customers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Customer can leverage ready-to-use guided workflows, automations, and role-specific execution to simplify and accelerate the entire Joule integration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Involved Components&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The different component involved are&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-disc"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP BTP&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Cloud Connector&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP S/4HANA PCE&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline"

Shot 1.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Though the Joule integration process is complex, the Cloud Integration Automation service is ideally positioned to connect Joule with SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition for these reasons:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cloud Integration Automation service being an AI enabled task orchestration tool.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Out of the box standardized guided workflows and role-based execution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integrated parameter management&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Hybrid approach, where in it can automate the steps and provide a documentation which cannot be automated.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cloud Integration Automation service comes with no additional cost and the service is available in SAP BTP.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Cloud Integration Automation service can provide the system landscape information hence bringing greater visibility of the entire customer landscape&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span

BM25 or other strategies are available. I love BM25's reliability for same-language and same-topic knowledge meshes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;One tool your agent calls&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Add a tool (below) so your agent can &lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;append or update&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; memories whenever it learns something new.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Update the Agent prompt to have it use the memory well!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Something like:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;pre class="lia-code-sample language-yaml"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Before answering, search (memory.search_hana) with a concise query (supplier/invoice/PO terms; limit top_k≤8); 
use the results to tailor your response. 
Only write when you learn a new, stable, factual business detail; 
upsert (memory.upsert_hana) instead of inserting duplicates—treat as duplicate if normalized context matches or vector similarity ≥0.86 and the same entity (supplier/invoice/PO) is involved; 
if duplicate, refresh last_seen_at (and occurrence_count if available). Format memories as one dense sentence in context 
(e.g., YYYY-MM-DD | INV-XXXX | Supplier ABC | PO 4500001123 | 4,980.00 EUR | expired PO used) 
and a brief actionable description; keep context ≤220 chars, use present tense. 
Set importance 1–5 (5 = critical risk) and ttl_days (low importance decays, 0 = never expires).
