    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="2"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Disclaimer: this article is written without Generative AI, even for the proof reading &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy the article written by human that is not common nowadays&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763843457"&gt;Why Business AI?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is what we always must start with. The business case should go first, for sure, and then we should evaluate possible deployment options, costs and security.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Statistics says that 95% of Generative AI implementations failed and that really scares the market in SAP enterprise software domain as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But let’s be honest, we are trying to sell Business AI anywhere as technology, forgetting about the customers, their uniqueness and their current pain points.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At Skybuffer starting from February 2025 (during the last 9 months) we have talked to more than 250 customers of different sizes presenting them Business AI technologies and discussing their use cases, or better to say helping them to find how Business AI can help their employees and partners to automate company’s workflows.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are three main groups of use cases, as we see it now:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Direct interaction with SAP backend system via corporate messengers that brings simplicity and mobility at the same time. In many cases Creating or Updating data in SAP from mobile phones or via Teams brings real value.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Converting any unstructured data to knowledge, like SharePoint sources, attachments in SAP, support tickets. Mixing those things together, in different document original languages create real value for employees providing them access to the data that is hidden in most of the organizations.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Capacity heavy activities delivered by AI agents, especially helpful with emails data analysis, where the main data is always in attachments. Sometimes it requires to utilize OCR extracting data from scanned PDFs in those scenarios. Some excellent examples are processing vendors emails and posting invoice or service entry sheets into SAP or receiving emails from customers converting their external purchasing data to sales orders.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is why SAP customers with any SAP backend system, either SAP ECC or S/4HANA, can implement Business AI today. I am not saying that it covers the entire Business AI implementation benefits, however, that is what we are focusing on now and helping SAP customers to allocate the benefits of using the technology.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567329952"&gt;Costs&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;In our opinion, Business AI is the tool that must be deployed inside IT infrastructure, and it is not a technology that must be considered only if it returns the investment. Think about the indirect impact of missing Business AI in your business landscape. For example, consider the costs of hiring new staff because your employees are moving to other companies that utilize modern technologies. Why should they move? Obvious, because of the same reason we are all talking about Generative AI – to stay competitive on the market.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, costs of AI must be assessed carefully, because in most of the architecture approaches Business AI is a consumption-based solution. Risky, isn’t it? Of course! Consumption is hard to estimate, and it is also hard to avoid picks, so budgets of Business AI productive usage might be unacceptably high compared to the potential savings the technology brings. That is why we built Skybuffer AI as a solution with the double deployment options:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On premise, there is a clear and 100% predictable TCO.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;On SAP BTP, this is a great option for CPEA contracts, for example, because in this case Business AI consumes the credits that are already paid, and we avoid extra costs for the infrastructure.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1370816447"&gt;Why is DGX Spark in the article name?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Well, DGX Spark here is not because it is a buzz word now, for sure. That is because DGX Spark provides an excellent opportunity for small and medium enterprises to bring 15x15x12 cm GPU-unit to support their Business AI operations for a very compatible price. Actually, it allows us to keep both compute-unit and GPU-unit in the network avoiding data leakage and consumption-based costs. Excellent? Of course!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here is how we use it deploying Skybuffer AI on premise:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_01_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338340i394A99D0F206E036/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_01_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" alt="Pic_01_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 01. Skybuffer AI deployment with GPU-unit served by DGX Spark&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174302942"&gt;Criticism?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, even writing this article I am already hearing the criticism &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt; Guessing the comments like, “that is not for productive environment”, “DGX Spark tokens generation too low to serve even Small businesses” and many other sharp negatives. But let’s move back to the beginning of the article and understand the reason why I’ve spent so much time talking about use cases first. Yes, now it is obvious that many mentioned use cases can be addressed by DGX Spark working as GPU-unit. Example? Easy!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example #1:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Vendor emails processing with data posting into SAP backend and saving originals (files) into the DMS (like SharePoint, Join, Google or whatever DMS is in use).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the architecture mentioned above, Skybuffer AI allows almost out of the box creation of an AI Agent that will check, for example, Account Payable mailbox, read emails, analyze attachments, move them to DMS and create financial postings in SAP backend saving links to the attachments in DMS (either external or internal SAP DMS) on the SAP financial document level. In scenario, if we schedule the agent carefully, it can work in the almost synchronous 24/7 mode.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In case we schedule the Vendor Emails processing AI Agent with the limit to process just one vendor email in the minute, we will avoid pick system loads, and in this case, we can keep AI agent active 24/7. In such deployment it will be able to process 1 440 emails and create postings in SAP a day, that gives us 43 200 a month and amazing number of 518 400 documents a year!! All powered by one DGX Spark GPU-unit keeping the data on premise and avoiding cloud consumption.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is what we call a proper deployment of Business AI. And Small and Medium businesses do not usually have such big number of documents from vendors, even the Cirque du Soleil does not have according to the latest SAP news post &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt; What we usually do, we add extra Business AI scenarios to be processed by the same Skybuffer AI deployment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example #2:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Automation of SAP user management services&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Small and Medium businesses do use password-based login to SAP backend, so users keep locking themselves or forgetting their passwords. Do we need a powerful GPU-unit with the full size LLM to automate this? No, for sure. We can add those business scenarios to the AI Agent that is processing Vendor Emails &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Example #3:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Bank data reconciliation&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The same setup can be used to assist financial department to match bank transactions to the billing documents in SAP and post accruals for the cases that could not be reconciled, for example, those that miss billing data in SAP that is not created just because someone has forgotten to enter it or integration interfaces have data processing issues. DGX Spark GPU-unit provides particularly good enough capacity here as well.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Those are just a few examples that wind away the skepticism about the utilization of DGX Spark in productive environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-977789437"&gt;Is it safe to invest in the on-premise Business AI setup?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you need full control over costs and data security, the answer is yes. And we think that the answer is yes in general, because Skybuffer AI dual deployment capabilities gives companies the guarantee that on premise Business AI investment can follow their potential future cloud strategy. I am writing and hearing again “what is this crazy man talking about! On premise investment can follow cloud strategies?? That is a paradox!”. And again, the answer is No, of course there is no paradox! If we look at the deployment of Skybuffer AI with integration with SAP Joule:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pic_02_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/338341i7F20323CDD2557C3/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pic_02_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" alt="Pic_02_Skybuffer_AI_DGX_Spark.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Figure 02: Skybuffer AI deployment in SAP BTP with integration with SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That is what we call real flexibility!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781275932"&gt;Sounds like a Gap Closing Solution?&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Yes, that is the conclusion we have. There no hard choice anymore to run Business AI on premise or on SAP BTP, no prerequisites to start using Business AI, because the deployment in this article works with SAP ECC (down to 7.01 and even below), SAP S/4HANA on premise or SAP S/4HANA in private cloud. The only question must be asked, when we are talking about Business AI, is about the scenario the company should start with? You’ve seen in our examples that Business AI deployments might bring benefits working in the scenarios that are independent from the historical data you have in your SAP backend and the historical data quality (sometimes it is called data silos), or scenarios that are independent from the version of your system and the point in time of your current digital journey. No need to wait for the upgrades, migrations, or other activities that sound like an act of catching a tail &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt;. Just allocate some budget for Business AI deployment, for example, on-premise deployment on DGX Spark that is very affordable, and get the positive feedback from your employees or business partners and enjoy your business workflows simplifications.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763819461"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Introduction&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Over the past year, Redwood Software has taken major steps forward in our long-standing partnership with SAP, turning the vision of conversational, agentic automation into something you can see and use today.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;As Field CTO at Redwood, I’ve spent many years helping SAP customers orchestrate their most critical workloads. Our shared mission with SAP has always been clear: make complex processes simpler, more reliable and, ultimately, autonomous.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567305956"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Embedding automation into conversation with Joule Studio&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In my &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-and-automation-blog-posts/how-redwood-augments-workload-automation-with-ai-using-joule-studio-in-sap/ba-p/14153724" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;previous post&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, I introduced how RunMyJobs by Redwood connects with SAP Joule Studio to transform automation into natural conversation. Since then, we’ve built a tech preview that demonstrates a use case for how RunMyJobs’ interoperability with SAP Joule makes agentic orchestration a reality you can scale for your most mission-critical processes.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;One example is an autonomous, unplanned SAP system maintenance workflow. Traditionally, this requires multiple manual steps and cross-team coordination to pause background jobs, stop dependent integrations and verify dependencies. The SAP BTP team often has to schedule, stop or undeploy iFlows ad hoc, while the Basis team handles job suspension separately. Thus, it’s a fragmented process filled with stress and risk.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Today, an SAP Basis administrator can take a more goal-oriented approach. They can simply tell Joule what they need to do:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Safely execute the SAP system maintenance procedure, including a pause on all dependent workflows associated with the system to avoid job failures.”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule triggers the complete, pre-approved workflow across RunMyJobs and the relevant SAP systems. Acting as an interactive control tower for the entire event, it executes pre-approved RunMyJobs workflows, coordinates with integrations and provides real-time progress and approval updates through natural language with either business or IT users.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For example, Joule might respond:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“All background jobs are paused, and Integration Suite iFlows are offline. Do you approve the system restart now, or do you want to send an approval request to the system administrator for a restart?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Once the administrator confirms, the automated workflow proceeds to the next step.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":backhand_index_pointing_right:"&gt;👉&lt;/span&gt;See Joule in action with RunMyJobs here:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F1nrqbA2Dq8A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1nrqbA2Dq8A&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F1nrqbA2Dq8A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="400" height="225" scrolling="no" title="RunMyJobs + SAP Joule: Driving mission-critical automation" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1370792451"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What we learned building Joule skills&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Working with Joule Studio’s low-code design canvas confirmed how quickly governed automation can be delivered through conversational interfaces. Our approach focused on four essentials:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Natural conversation design:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Translating how SAP users actually phrase requests into machine-understandable prompts&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Action orchestration:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Linking RunMyJobs APIs or pre-built SAP Accelerator Hub actions for pausing jobs, managing iFlows and performing restarts safely&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Context and safeguards:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Supplying metadata so Joule executes only on the right systems, with test harnesses for edge cases&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governed deployment:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Leveraging accelerated compliance checks provided by RunMyJobs’ SAP Endorsed App Premium certification to reliably execute controlled deployment across SAP environments&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174278946"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How RunMyJobs and Joule Studio connect&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The integration between RunMyJobs and Joule Studio allows your teams to innovate safely across SAP environments and in various scenarios. The process looks like this:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Publish operations in RunMyJobs&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, such as starting or pausing jobs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Publish actions to the SAP Business Accelerator Hub&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, making them available as reusable building blocks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Secure access through SAP BTP&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; using API keys and role-based permissions. You then govern access to these operations within the SAP BTP Cockpit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Combine these actions in Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; to build skills that connect automation with natural language requests.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This framework lets IT and business teams interact with automation directly in their workflow tools, so it’s governed, auditable and ready for expansion.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-977765441"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The future of automation is a conversation&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;We are only at the starting line of what’s possible. The combination of RunMyJobs and SAP Joule is laying the foundation for agentic automation across finance, supply chain, HR, IT and beyond. As SAP continues to advance its Business AI capabilities, Redwood will keep embedding orchestration where it matters most: within the business conversation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/partners/redwood-technology-bv-runmyjobs-by-redwood.html?countryCode=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Learn more about how Redwood works with SAP solutions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. The "Global Maxima" Strategy: Why the "App + Data + AI" Flywheel is the Core Bet&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP's core strategic argument stays consistent - that "&lt;EM&gt;a seamless app, data, and AI flywheel creates the highest value&lt;/EM&gt;". This model, where all three components are part of a single, integrated suite, was positioned as the only way to win in the new age of AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;This was a direct declaration that the integrated suite is superior to a "best-of-breed" approach.&amp;nbsp;Muhammad argued that AI with the "broadest context" (drawn from a full suite) will always provide the "deepest value".&amp;nbsp;He explicitly stated that standalone players focusing on just one or two domains "will then, by definition, struggle to create enterprise-wide value with AI".&amp;nbsp;For SAP, this "out-of-the-box harmonized data model" is no longer just a nice-to-have; it's the essential foundation for achieving "global maxima" and avoiding the integration tax and "opportunity cost" of a fragmented landscape.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="1. SAP's &amp;quot;App + Data + AI&amp;quot; Flywheel Concept" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335069iC6F6DEAFE19E0E7D/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="1.

SAP's "App + Data + AI" Flywheel Concept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Joule, Agents, and AI Assistants: The New Operating Model&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP is operationalizing its AI strategy through a new hierarchy:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The single conversational "Gen UI" that acts as the engagement layer.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agents:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The specialized "tools" that perform specific tasks.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;AI Assistants:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Role-specific partners, such as a "Receivable Assistant," "Controlling Assistant," or "Sourcing Assistant", which have these agents at their disposal.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is the "how" behind the "what."&amp;nbsp;Stefan's end-to-end demo showed&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;as the single interface to drive insights and actions across the entire business suite, from procurement-to-pay to order-to-cash.&amp;nbsp;Priyanka's demo took this a step further, showing an "operations&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;assistant&lt;/STRONG&gt;" for a plant manager, which then orchestrated multiple&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;agents&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(like the "asset health agent," "maintenance planner agent," and "procurement assistant") to resolve a complex machine breakdown. This signals a fundamental redesign of the user experience, moving from clicking through apps to orchestrating complex, cross-functional outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="2.

Joule, Agents, and AI Assistants_The New Operating Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;3. The 5 Patterns of AI: A New Framework for Business Applications&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The keynote introduced a five-pattern framework to explain how AI will "fundamentally reinvent business applications".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This conceptual framework is a crucial guide for business leaders planning their AI roadmaps. It shows a multi-pronged innovation strategy, acknowledging that different processes will be transformed in different ways.&amp;nbsp;The five patterns are:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Seamlessly embedded AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;and agentic experiences.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agent-driven autonomous execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;capabilities.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Truly AI-native applications&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;built from the ground up.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;App-less experiences&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;driven by a conversational layer.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;No-apps experiences&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;where the app is generated in real-time.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="3.

The 5 Patterns of AI_A New Framework for Business Applications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4. From Insight-to-Action... to Autonomous Execution&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP is aggressively pushing beyond simple AI recommendations toward "agent-driven autonomous execution".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is the end-game.&amp;nbsp;The keynote stressed that this evolution will happen as "your colleague has built enough trust on the assistant's performance".&amp;nbsp;Priyanka's demo of an "autonomous maintenance and repair operation" was the flagship example.&amp;nbsp;The vision is for the system to autonomously handle an entire complex event - from detecting a machine failure to identifying orders at risk, ordering the spare part from a supplier, and dispatching the best technician,... with the human partner simply monitoring and approving, not executing the workflow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="4. From Insight to Action to Autonomous Execution" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335072iC35A9280878B13DC/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="4. From Insight to Action to Autonomous Execution.png" alt="4. From Insight to Action to Autonomous Execution" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;4. From Insight to Action to Autonomous Execution&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;5. "Deep Research": Joule's New High-Value Skill&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;A powerful new capability in Joule called "deep research" was introduced and demoed.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is where SAP expects to unlock "100x type use cases for value".&amp;nbsp;Instead of just answering simple, transactional queries, "deep research" allows Joule to synthesize "vast amounts of internal and external data" to answer complex, strategic questions.&amp;nbsp;The example of compressing a 6-8 week account planning process into "just a few hours" - by synthesizing history, surfacing drivers, comparing playbooks, and drafting a plan - is a tangible game-changer for any go-to-market organization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="5. Deep Research in Joule" style="width: 892px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335073i36197C49E00312DF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="5. Deep Research in Joule.png" alt="5. Deep Research in Joule" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;5. Deep Research in Joule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;6. Truly AI-Native Applications Arrive (Supply Chain &amp;amp; Ariba)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP unveiled its first "truly AI-native applications", making good on the promise of its 5-pattern framework.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This proves the framework isn't just theory.&amp;nbsp;The new&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supply Chain Orchestration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;solution was the prime example, described as a "GPS for your supply chain" that uses a "network knowledge graph" to analyze real-time signals, assess risk, and suggest alternatives.&amp;nbsp;The major&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Ariba source-to-pay suite update&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;was also positioned as "AI-native", enabling an "agentic and autonomous" approach to procurement.&amp;nbsp;For existing customers, the most important line was the promise that this Ariba update will be "a non-disruptive update... that will not require a re-implementation"&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="6. Supply Chain Orchestration" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335074i10327D75AECE8CFF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="6. Supply Chain Orchestration.png" alt="6. Supply Chain Orchestration" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;6. Supply Chain Orchestration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;7. "Skills are the New Supply Chain"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The "Future of Work" segment, featuring Chief People Officer of SAP, Gina Vargiu-Breuer and futurist Ian Beecraft, reframed the entire human-AI partnership around the concept of "skills".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This segment's most memorable line was Gina's: "&lt;EM&gt;skills are the new supply chain&lt;/EM&gt;".&amp;nbsp;With the shelf-life of technical skills plummeting to 18-36 months, the focus must shift from static "jobs" to a dynamic "skills-first" approach.&amp;nbsp;AI is positioned as the enabler, allowing employees to "stretch into adjacent territories and skills" - for example, a financial planner using AI to perform predictive analytics without needing a data science degree.&amp;nbsp;This makes a strong case for SAP SuccessFactors as the critical platform for managing this new, fast-moving "supply chain" of talent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;8. Business Data Cloud Gets Smarter with "Intelligent Applications"&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;SAP is expanding its Business Data Cloud offering with a new suite of "intelligent applications".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is the "Data" layer of the flywheel in action.&amp;nbsp;The new apps:&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Finance Intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supply Chain Intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Revenue Intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Consumer Products Intelligence &lt;/STRONG&gt;...&amp;nbsp;are designed to sit on top of the harmonized data layer and provide the "broadest context" the AI flywheel needs. This move elevates the Business Data Cloud from a purely technical "data fabric" into a tangible value-delivery platform, providing the out-of-the-box insights that fuel the AI assistants.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="8. Business Data Cloud Gets Smarter with Intelligent Applications" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335075i524EC783F33DBD22/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="8.

Business Data Cloud Gets Smarter with Intelligent Applications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;9. SAP Engagement Cloud: Orchestrating Journeys Beyond Marketing&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What was announced:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The launch of the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Engagement Cloud&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a platform designed to "harmonize business data into actionable segments, triggers and journeys" for hyper-personalization.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "So What":&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;The key insight is that "engagement" is an enterprise-wide challenge, not just a marketing one.&amp;nbsp;The demos pointedly showed this new cloud working for&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;HR&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(orchestrating an alumni event) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Procurement&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;(managing a supplier compliance journey).&amp;nbsp;By creating a single, unified engine for all enterprise touchpoints - across HCM, procurement, and service - SAP is delivering on the "global maxima" theme, ensuring that every interaction, whether with a customer, supplier, or employee, is seamless and intelligent.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The Joule capability "Expiring Price Handling" has been released in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition 2502.3. This blog introduces this feature in detail, so that you can&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;interact with Joule smoothly and manage expiring prices efficiently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763634982"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Overview&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;You&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;can ask Joule to fetch prices (stored as condition records for pricing in sales in the system) that will expire soon. For expiring prices, Joule can help renew them by extending their validity periods and adjusting the condition amounts or ratios according to your requirements. After you confirm to extend the expiring prices, a price renewal background job will be created. You can also check the progress and result of the price renewal job via Joule.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 1" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/332832iDB20303B6F23A9F9/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="image.png" alt="Figure 1" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Please check out the following help document and demo for a glimpse.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/capabilities-guide/renew-expiring-prices?version=CLOUD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Help Document: Renew Expiring Prices&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.101/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/1921661/uiconf_id/37285991/entry_id/1_16pip6t9?wid=_1921661&amp;amp;iframeembed=true&amp;amp;playerId=kaltura_player&amp;amp;entry_id=1_16pip6t9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Demo: Renew Product Prices with Joule&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567121477"&gt;Feature in Details&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1757856129"&gt;Definition of "Expiring Price"&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before using this feature, it's important to understand what qualifies as an "Expiring Price". Joule retrieves prices that expire between the current date and the given date (including both dates) without a successor record. Only records without a successor are considered "Expiring". &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Case 1 and 2: Prices without a successor --&amp;gt; considered "expiring".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Case 3:&amp;nbsp;Even if its Valid-To date falls between the current date and the given date, it has a successor with a continuous validity period starting right after its Valid-To date --&amp;gt; not considered "expiring".&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Case 4:&amp;nbsp;Already expired prices --&amp;gt; not considered "expiring".&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 2" style="width: 818px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/333181iADECCE92865C38A0/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="scqllw_1-1761621888967.png" alt="Figure 2" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Note that, this feature only retrieves/renews the prices approaching expiration (meaning still valid for the time being), but cannot fetch/renew the prices which are already expired (Case 4 above).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1561342624"&gt;How Are Expiring Prices Renewed?&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;Instead of updating the original Valid-To date of the expiring price, Joule creates a new continuous validity period for the expiring price (with Valid-From date set to the date one day after the Valid-To date of the expiring price). Optionally, the new validity period could have a new condition amount/ratio. The purpose of this is to keep the existing "Expiring Price" unchanged, but create its successor only.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Do take note that, the new validity being created could possibly overlap with the existing validity that lies in future, such as the Case 2 above. Assume that the gap between the expiring price and its future validity is 9 months long. If we extend the validity period of the expiring price by 1 year, the new validity and existing future validity will overlap for 3 months. In this case, the new validity will overwrite the existing validity during the overlapped period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId-1364829119"&gt;Always Start from "Show Expiring Prices"&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;You can activate the "Expiring Price Handling" feature by talking to Joule with phrases like below:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"Show me prices for sales organization 1710 that expire before December 31, 2025."&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"List the prices with condition type PPR0 that are expiring before Dec 31, 2025."&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;"Are there any prices for condition type PPR0 and sales organization 1010 expiring before December 31, 2025?"&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Even if you ask Joule to extend the expiring price directly, you will be redirected to show expiring prices, because the extension/renewal could only be performed on the expiring prices already listed in Joule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 3" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/332923iA72CAED9B0AC3D49/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="scqllw_2-1761555577901.png" alt="Figure 3" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Expiration date is a mandatory for querying expiring prices.

You can click "Open in App" to navigate to the "Manage Prices - Sales" app to check the details of the job.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 7" style="width: 444px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/333149i34A97E8A6E99774C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="scqllw_0-1761612005077.png" alt="Figure 7" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Alternatively, you can also go to "Manage Prices - Sales" app --&amp;gt; click "Monitor Imports and Jobs" at the upper-right corner. --&amp;gt; switch to "Scheduled Jobs" tab. All the previously created jobs are listed, including the mass creation job created from "Manage Prices - Sales" app. Note that the price renewal jobs created via Joule are always named "Price Renewal xxxxxxxxxxxxxx".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 8" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/333154i7CD4843D6FD04164/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="scqllw_1-1761612665950.png" alt="Figure 8" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--4986563"&gt;Limitations&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--734454732"&gt;Instability of Resolving Expiration Date&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you ask Joule to show the prices expiring in &lt;EM&gt;N&lt;/EM&gt; months/days, Joule may occasionally resolve the expiration date incorrectly. This can lead to an inaccurate or empty results. This is because the current LLMs do&amp;nbsp;not inherently have awareness of real-time information.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thus, we recommend providing specific dates to Joule, such as "Show me prices that are going to expire before 31 Dec, 2025" or "List prices due to expire on 31/03/2026".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H5 id="toc-hId--930968237"&gt;Short Request Timeout&lt;/H5&gt;&lt;P&gt;There's a short request timeout (only 15 seconds) imposed by Joule on any API call to backend.&amp;nbsp;If you don't provide any filter criteria, you may encounter a timeout.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Figure 9" style="width: 413px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/333155i85F374443894E51C/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="scqllw_2-1761614508228.png" alt="Figure 9" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Figure 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Therefore, always include at least one of the supported filters while asking Joule to show the expiring prices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In the age of AI, the skills we build today will define how we work tomorrow. That’s why we’ve launched a monthly series of blogs that spotlight the latest AI learning assets and upcoming learning opportunities. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Building on my &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/from-hype-to-hands-on-level-up-your-ai-skills-this-october/ba-p/14240442" target="_blank"&gt;previous blog&lt;/A&gt; where I introduced you to our newest AI live sessions &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/pdf/asset/preview/UC5poz7?ltr=a&amp;amp;rc=10&amp;amp;doi=SAP1239031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Beyond Hype&lt;/A&gt; (which is all about getting productive with SAP Business AI), let me follow up with you on your most asked questions:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What is Embedded AI?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;This is where SAP embeds AI features directly into its cloud solutions across the Business Suite, such as SAP SuccessFactors or SAP Customer Experience. In other words, these AI capabilities operate natively inside core business applications such as ERP, procurement, HR, and supply chain management. SAP customers benefit from AI immediately with out-of-the-box AI features which minimizes the need to build custom solutions from scratch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Do you know&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; about the &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/resources/embedded-ai-explained" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Embedded AI Explained page&lt;/A&gt; that not only provides examples of embedded AI capabilities in enterprise solutions but also includes other helpful information? No? Check it out! My favorite embedded AI feature is SAP SuccessFactors Performance and Goals &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ai-feature/231d6a91-c550-4bca-8de7-b903cb7e7f5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;performance goal creation&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ai-feature/ef16dd9e-a2db-44df-bb8b-23b16c68bd88/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;development goal creation&lt;/A&gt;: Thanks to AI these features reduce the time needed to ideate and draft goal content while also making goals more concise. This &lt;A href="https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/pdf/asset/preview/KnhJTfJ?ltr=a&amp;amp;rc=68&amp;amp;doi=SAP1150817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;slide deck&lt;/A&gt; showcases other ways in which SAP Business AI capabilities create value for every aspect of your business through key personas.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Is there a place to get a complete overview of available AI features and Joule agents?&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Of course there is! &lt;STRONG&gt;Do you know&lt;/STRONG&gt; you can explore AI offerings in the&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;A href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/ai-catalog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;AI Catalog&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;? It currently shows 313 AI Agents and Features, spanning from Beta, Early Adopter Care, and generally available.

Missions include best practices and step-by-step guidance for use case implementation, supported by mission experts and the SAP Community.

With Joule, business users can use natural language requests to receive conversational help when navigating their SAP systems, automating business transactions, getting insights grounded in their business data, and also when accelerating complex multi-step workflows with AI agents. SAP Joule for Consultants is more aligned with assisting system integrators and internal consultants who are delivering SAP projects and cloud transformations. With SAP Joule for Consultants, consultants get the expert-level guidance they need on-demand to help them make better decisions and execute project tasks according to best practices.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Want to dive deeper into the content?

    <content>&lt;P class=""&gt;Stell Dir vor, du gibst deinem zehnjährigen Kind morgens die Anweisung: "In zehn Minuten fahren wir zur Schule." Was passiert? Im Idealfall zieht es sich selbstständig an – Hose, Schuhe, Jacke – und steht bereit. Genau so funktionieren KI-Agenten. Diese Metapher nutzt &lt;A href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjochen/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Jochen Schneider&lt;/A&gt;, verantwortlich für AI Capabilities auf der SAP Business Technology Platform, um zu erklären, was Agentic AI von herkömmlichen Gen-AI-Lösungen unterscheidet. Im aktuellen &lt;A href="https://podcast.opensap.info/education-newscast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;EducationNewscast&lt;/A&gt; gibt er einen umfassenden Einblick in die Welt der KI-Agenten bei SAP – von den Grundlagen über praktische Beispiele bis hin zu konkreten Tipps für den Einstieg.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Hier eine Zusammenfassung des fast einstündigen Interviews und Gespräch - reinhören könnt ihr hier auf &lt;A href="https://podcast.opensap.info/education-newscast/2025/10/27/enc374-ki-agenten-bei-sap-uberblick-beispiele-nutzung-und-adoption-mit-jochen-schneider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;SAP-Podcasts -&lt;/A&gt; &lt;A class="" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/enc374-ki-agenten-bei-sap-%C3%BCberblick-beispiele-nutzung/id1352307529?i=1000733653247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Apple&lt;/A&gt; - oder &lt;A class="" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5hsuELMNmsySwkMeZDcC4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Spotify.&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;Da das Thema so wichtig und spannend ist, denke ich, dass eine Zusammenfassung des Talks auch hier in der Gruppe von Interesse ist.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AIAgenten.png" style="width: 869px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335427i2D75D43AB018E67F/image-dimensions/869x739/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="869" height="739" role="button" title="AIAgenten.png" alt="AIAgenten.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763873095"&gt;Was KI-Agenten wirklich ausmacht&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Der Unterschied zwischen einem klassischen Chatbot oder Assistenten und einem KI-Agenten ist fundamental. Während du bei ChatGPT einen Prompt eingibst und eine Antwort erhältst, arbeiten Agenten deutlich komplexer und autonomer. Jochen erklärt das Prinzip anhand seiner Kinder: Du gibst nicht jeden einzelnen Schritt vor ("Zieh die Hose an, dann die Schuhe"), sondern beschreibst das gewünschte Ergebnis. Der Agent findet dann selbst heraus, welche Schritte nötig sind, um dieses Ziel zu erreichen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Damit ein Agent funktioniert, braucht er drei zentrale Komponenten: &lt;STRONG&gt;Tools&lt;/STRONG&gt; (die "Hände", um Aktionen auszuführen), &lt;STRONG&gt;Reasoning-Fähigkeiten&lt;/STRONG&gt; (den "Kopf", um Entscheidungen zu treffen) und &lt;STRONG&gt;Memory&lt;/STRONG&gt; (das "Gedächtnis", um Kontext zu behalten und aus Erfahrungen zu lernen). Diese Kombination ermöglicht es Agenten, komplexe Aufgaben eigenständig zu bewältigen, ohne dass du jeden Zwischenschritt vorgeben musst.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Ein wichtiger Punkt, den Jochen betont: Nicht alles sollte oder muss zum Agenten werden. Es gibt aktuell viel "Agent-Washing" – Workflows, die als Agenten verkauft werden, obwohl sie deterministisch ablaufen. Seine Empfehlung ist klar: Wenn du einen Prozess mit einem klassischen Workflow abbilden kannst, solltest du das tun. Das ist kostengünstiger und effizienter. Agenten zeigen ihre Stärke dort, wo Prozesse dynamisch, komplex und von äußeren Faktoren beeinflusst sind.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567359590"&gt;Wichtige Begriffe einfach erklärt&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Im Dialog mit Claude über den Podcast habe ich festgestellt, dass doch einige Fachbegriffe im Podcast vorkamen. Bevor wir in die Details eintauchen, hier die wichtigsten Fachbegriffe, die im Podcast und in dieser Zusammenfassung vorkommen – verständlich erklärt. (War kein Teil des Podcasts, KI Experten können das einfach überspringen).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agentic AI / KI-Agenten&lt;/STRONG&gt; Softwaresysteme, die eigenständig Ziele verfolgen und dabei selbst entscheiden, welche Schritte nötig sind. Anders als klassische Programme, die Schritt für Schritt Anweisungen befolgen, bekommen Agenten nur das Ziel vorgegeben und finden den Weg dorthin selbst. Wie ein Mitarbeiter, dem du sagst "Organisiere das Meeting", statt "Schreibe eine E-Mail an Person X, buche Raum Y, bestelle Catering Z".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tokens&lt;/STRONG&gt; Die "Währung" von KI-Modellen. Texte werden in kleine Einheiten (Tokens) zerlegt – ungefähr 4 Zeichen pro Token. Jede Anfrage an ein KI-Modell und jede Antwort kostet Tokens, und damit Geld. "Tokens verbrennen" bedeutet: unnötig viele (teure) Anfragen an die KI stellen, z.B. wenn ein Agent in einer Endlosschleife hängt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic&lt;/STRONG&gt; Deterministisch = vorhersagbar. Bei einem klassischen Workflow weißt du genau: Bei Input A kommt immer Output B raus. Non-deterministisch = nicht vorhersagbar. Ein Agent kann bei derselben Aufgabe verschiedene Lösungswege wählen – wie ein Mensch, der kreativ an Probleme herangeht. Das macht Agenten flexibel, aber auch weniger kontrollierbar.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reasoning&lt;/STRONG&gt; Die Fähigkeit eines KI-Modells, logisch zu denken, Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen und Probleme zu lösen. Statt nur Muster aus Trainingsdaten zu wiederholen, können moderne Reasoning-Modelle mehrschrittige Überlegungen anstellen – ähnlich wie du bei einer komplexen Entscheidung Pro und Contra abwägst.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Tools (im Agent-Kontext)&lt;/STRONG&gt; Die "Werkzeuge", die ein Agent nutzen kann, um Aufgaben zu erledigen. Das können APIs sein (um Daten abzurufen), Datenbanken (um Informationen zu suchen), oder Funktionen (um E-Mails zu versenden, Kalendereinträge zu erstellen etc.). Ohne Tools ist ein Agent wie ein Handwerker ohne Werkzeugkasten – er kann denken, aber nichts umsetzen. #Hände &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"&gt;🙂&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Memory (Short-Term &amp;amp; Long-Term)&lt;/STRONG&gt; Das "Gedächtnis" eines Agenten. Short-Term Memory = er erinnert sich an die aktuelle Konversation ("Du hast vorhin gesagt, dass..."). Long-Term Memory = er speichert Informationen über längere Zeit ("Letzten Monat hattest du nach X gefragt"). Ohne Memory müsstest du einem Agenten jedes Mal alles neu erklären.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Human in the Loop&lt;/STRONG&gt; Ein Kontrollmechanismus, bei dem ein Mensch an kritischen Punkten eingebunden wird, bevor der Agent eine Aktion ausführt. Wie ein Vier-Augen-Prinzip: Der Agent schlägt vor, der Mensch entscheidet. Besonders wichtig bei sensiblen Aufgaben oder am Anfang, wenn du dem Agenten noch nicht voll vertraust.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Evals (Evaluations)&lt;/STRONG&gt; Automatisierte Tests, die kontinuierlich prüfen, ob ein Agent die gewünschte Qualität liefert. Ähnlich wie Qualitätskontrollen in der Produktion: Du definierst Kriterien (z.B. "Antworten müssen faktisch korrekt sein", "Prozess darf max. 5 Minuten dauern") und der Eval prüft regelmäßig, ob diese eingehalten werden.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; Ein Standard von Androphic, der definiert, wie KI-Modelle auf externe Tools und Datenquellen zugreifen können. Stell dir vor, jedes Tool hätte einen anderen Stecker – MCP ist wie ein Universal-Adapter, der alles kompatibel macht. Das ermöglicht Agenten, flexibel verschiedene Werkzeuge zu nutzen, ohne dass für jedes eine spezielle Integration nötig ist.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agent-to-Agent (A2A)&lt;/STRONG&gt; Kommunikation zwischen verschiedenen Agenten. Statt dass ein Agent alles alleine macht, können mehrere Agenten zusammenarbeiten – wie Kollegen in verschiedenen Abteilungen. Ein Agent analysiert ein Problem, ein anderer setzt die Lösung um, ein dritter überwacht das Ergebnis. A2A-Protokolle regeln, wie diese Zusammenarbeit funktioniert.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Edge Models&lt;/STRONG&gt; KI-Modelle, die direkt auf deinem Gerät (Smartphone, Laptop, IoT-Device) laufen, statt in der Cloud. "Edge" bedeutet "am Rand des Netzwerks", also bei dir vor Ort. Vorteil: Deine Daten bleiben auf deinem Gerät (Datenschutz!), und du brauchst keine Internetverbindung. Wird möglich, weil Modelle immer kleiner und Geräte immer leistungsfähiger werden.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;World Models&lt;/STRONG&gt; KI-Modelle, die nicht nur Sprache verstehen, sondern ein Verständnis der physischen Welt entwickeln – 3D-Raum, Bewegung, Ursache-Wirkung. Wie ein Kind, das durch Interaktion mit der Umwelt lernt. World Models können vorhersagen, was passiert, wenn ein Ball rollt oder ein Objekt fällt. Wichtig für Robotik und komplexere KI-Anwendungen, die in der realen Welt agieren.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Knowledge Graph&lt;/STRONG&gt; Eine strukturierte Datenbank, die Informationen als Netzwerk von Beziehungen speichert. Statt isolierter Datenpunkte siehst du Zusammenhänge: "Person A arbeitet bei Firma B", "Firma B hat Produkt C", "Produkt C wird in Land D verkauft". Hilft Agenten, Kontext zu verstehen und intelligentere Entscheidungen zu treffen. (Sehr spannend als Wissensmanagement Enthusiast, dazu muss ich noch ein Podcast mal machen).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)&lt;/STRONG&gt; Die Gesamtkosten, die eine Lösung über ihre gesamte Lebensdauer verursacht – nicht nur die Anschaffung, sondern auch Betrieb, Wartung, Schulung etc. Bei Agenten: Token-Kosten, Entwicklungsaufwand, Monitoring, Fehlerkorrektur. Manchmal ist ein einfacher Workflow TCO-mäßig besser als ein Agent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Workflow vs. Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt; Der zentrale Unterschied: Ein &lt;STRONG&gt;Workflow&lt;/STRONG&gt; ist wie ein Rezept – du gibst jeden Schritt vor (wenn X, dann Y, sonst Z). Ein &lt;STRONG&gt;Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt; ist wie ein Koch – du sagst "Mach ein leckeres Abendessen für 4 Personen", und er entscheidet selbst, welche Zutaten und Schritte nötig sind. Workflows sind günstiger und zuverlässiger für klar definierte Prozesse. Agenten sind besser für komplexe, dynamische Situationen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;BTP (Business Technology Platform)&lt;/STRONG&gt; Die technologische Grundlage von SAP für Cloud-Anwendungen, Integrationen und – jetzt neu – KI-Agenten. Hier laufen die Modelle, hier werden Agenten entwickelt (im Joule Studio), hier greifen sie auf Unternehmensdaten zu. Die Plattform bietet Enterprise-Features wie Security, Skalierbarkeit und Compliance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAPs KI-Assistent, conversational Interface und gleichzeitig die zentrale Schnittstelle für Agenten. Joule ist mehr als ein Chatbot – es ist die Orchestrierungsebene, über die du mit Agenten interagierst, sie startest, überwachst und Feedback gibst. Denk an Joule als "Kontrollzentrum" für deine digitalen Mitarbeiter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;So - jetzt geht es weiter mit der Zusammenfassung des Podcast.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1370846085"&gt;Züge auf Gleisen versus autonome Autos als Metaphern&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Um die Rolle von Agenten im Unternehmenskontext zu verdeutlichen, nutzt Jochen eine zweite einprägsame Metapher: Stell dir einen alten Zug auf Gleisen vor, daneben hochmoderne, vollautonome Autos auf einer Straße. Der Zug repräsentiert klassische, klar definierte Prozesse – sie laufen zuverlässig, transportieren viel und brauchen keine Änderung. Solange die Gleise frei sind, ist das perfekt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Problematisch wird es, wenn Unvorhergesehenes passiert: eine Baustelle, ein Hindernis auf den Gleisen, eine notwendige Routenänderung. Hier kommen die autonomen Autos ins Spiel – die KI-Agenten. Sie finden flexibel ihren Weg zum Ziel, auch wenn die Ideallinie blockiert ist. Sie transportieren zwar weniger als ein Zug, dafür kannst du viele gleichzeitig losschicken und sie passen sich dynamisch an veränderte Bedingungen an.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Diese Analogie macht deutlich: In der Unternehmenswelt der Zukunft werden beide Systeme koexistieren. Stabile, wenig änderungsbedürftige Prozesse bleiben bestehen. Agenten kommen dort zum Einsatz, wo Flexibilität, Anpassungsfähigkeit und komplexe Entscheidungsfindung gefragt sind – etwa bei sich ändernden Zollbestimmungen, individuellen Kundenanfragen oder komplexen Analyseaufgaben.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174332580"&gt;SAP Joule und die Rolle von Agenten&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Bei SAP läuft die Agent-Strategie über mehrere Ebenen zusammen. &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt; ist dabei weit mehr als nur ein Conversational Interface – es ist die zentrale Klammer, die Agenten zugänglich macht, sie orchestriert und dem Nutzer eine einheitliche Interaktionsfläche bietet. Jochen beschreibt Joule als das "Surface", hinter dem eine komplexe technologische Infrastruktur arbeitet.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Agenten können auf verschiedene Arten getriggert werden: Entweder durch eine Konversation mit Joule ("Wie sieht mein Abverkauf diese Woche aus und was kann ich optimieren?") oder durch System-Trigger im Hintergrund, wenn sich bestimmte Daten ändern oder Ereignisse eintreten. Wenn ein Agent im Hintergrund auf ein Problem stößt und eskalieren muss, ist Joule die Instanz, die den Menschen einbindet – ähnlich wie ein Mitarbeiter zu seinem Manager geht, wenn er nicht weiterkommt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Die technologische Basis bildet die &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; mit dem AI Core für Model Access. Ein großer Vorteil: Du hast dort Zugriff auf über 40 verschiedene Modelle von allen großen Anbietern. Das ist wichtig, weil verschiedene Aufgaben unterschiedliche Modelle erfordern – für einfache Tasks nutzt man besser kostengünstige, kleine Modelle, für komplexe Reasoning-Aufgaben greifst du am besten auf leistungsstarke Modelle zurück.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-977819075"&gt;Konkrete Beispiele aus der Praxis von KI-Agenten&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Jochen teilt mehrere spannende Use Cases, die zeigen, wo Agenten bereits heute Mehrwert schaffen. Ein offensichtliches Beispiel sind &lt;STRONG&gt;Service-Ticket-Agenten&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Ein Ticket kommt rein, der Agent analysiert, ob der Claim gerechtfertigt ist, identifiziert die Fehlerquelle (eigene Seite, Supplier, Kunde) und schlägt eine Lösung vor. Bevor er diese umsetzt, bindet er den Menschen ein – der klassische "Human in the Loop".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Besonders interessant ist ein Beispiel aus Jochens eigenem Team: ein &lt;STRONG&gt;Pipeline-Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt; für die Software-Entwicklung. Wenn bei einem Deployment Fehler auftreten, analysiert der Agent automatisch Logs mit zehntausenden Zeilen, identifiziert das Problem und schlägt eine Lösung vor. Ein zweiter Agent kann dann direkt den Code anpassen. Das spart nicht nur Zeit, sondern macht auch weniger erfahrene Entwickler produktiver, die früher auf Senior-Kollegen angewiesen waren.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Im &lt;STRONG&gt;HR-Bereich&lt;/STRONG&gt; gibt es Agenten für Karriereplanung und Zielentwicklung, im &lt;STRONG&gt;Finance-Bereich&lt;/STRONG&gt; unterstützen sie Power-User bei komplexen Analysen. Die Bandbreite reicht vom hochspezialisierten Tech-Experten bis zum Endnutzer, der seine persönliche Entwicklung plant. Jochen selbst nutzt privat einen Agenten, der seine E-Mails von der Schule zusammenfasst, wichtige Termine in den Kalender einträgt und ihn an Dinge erinnert, die sonst untergehen würden – gebaut mit &lt;A class="" href="http://lindy.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Lindy.ai&lt;/A&gt;, einem visuellen Low-Code-Framework. (Steht auf meiner To-Learn Liste).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781305570"&gt;Agenten bauen mit dem Joule Studio&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Die gute Nachricht: Einen Agenten im &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/STRONG&gt; zu erstellen ist überraschend einfach – auch wenn technischer Sachverstand wichtig bleibt. Die Grundschritte sind überschaubar: Du gibst dem Agenten einen Namen, eine Rolle (z.B. Finance-Experte oder Service-Experte) und eine klare Instruction, die den gewünschten Outcome beschreibt.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Dann stattest du ihn mit den nötigen &lt;STRONG&gt;Tools&lt;/STRONG&gt; aus – das umfasst Datenzugriffe, API-Schnittstellen und MCP-Tools (Model Context Protocol). Du entscheidest, auf welche Systeme der Agent zugreifen darf und welche Daten relevant sind. Anschließend wählst du das passende Modell: ein starkes Reasoning-Modell für komplexe Aufgaben, ein kleineres für einfache Tasks. Danach kannst du den Agenten bereits testen – die "Magic" passiert auf der Runtime im Framework.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Der Agent zerlegt den Auftrag selbstständig in Tasks, arbeitet diese ab und nutzt die verfügbaren Tools, um fehlende Informationen zu beschaffen. Jochen beschreibt einen Agenten als "LLM-Zugriff im Loop", der kontinuierlich durch neue Informationen von außen ergänzt wird. Das Joule Studio bietet dabei Enterprise-Grade-Features wie Security, Data Privacy, Scalability und Audit-Logs – Anforderungen, die viele andere Frameworks noch nicht erfüllen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Ein wichtiger Aspekt ist die &lt;STRONG&gt;Granularität&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Wie komplex sollte ein Agent sein? Die Antwort hängt vom Business-Prozess ab. Viele Unternehmensprozesse sind sequenziell getaktet, weshalb Agent-to-Agent-Kommunikation (A2A) seltener nötig ist als zunächst gedacht. Oft reicht ein komplexer Agent oder eine sequenzielle Abfolge mehrerer Agenten – wie beim Pipeline-Beispiel, wo ein Agent analysiert und ein zweiter die Lösung umsetzt. Das ermöglicht auch, den Menschen zwischen den Schritten einzubinden.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-584792065"&gt;Daten als Fundament von AI-Agents&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Agenten sind nur so gut wie die Daten, auf die sie zugreifen können. Dabei gilt nicht einfach "je mehr, desto besser", sondern: &lt;STRONG&gt;die richtigen Daten zur richtigen Zeit&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Zu viele Daten können einen Agenten sogar verwirren und die Qualität verschlechtern. Hier kommen Lösungen wie &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Datasphere&lt;/STRONG&gt; und &lt;STRONG&gt;Business Data Cloud (BDC)&lt;/STRONG&gt; ins Spiel.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;BDC bietet Data Products mit semantischer Beschreibung von Daten, spezifisch auf den Business-Kontext zugeschnitten. Das ist ein Riesenasset von SAP: Das Unternehmen kennt den Business-Kontext, weiß, wo sich der User bewegt, und kann über Joule und BDC genau die Informationen bereitstellen, die der Agent für seine Aufgabe braucht. Knowledge Graphs helfen dabei, Daten zu sortieren und Zusammenhänge zu verstehen – die Ontologie, also das Verständnis, wie Daten zusammengehören, ist entscheidend für die Qualität der Agent-Outputs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Diese tiefe Integration in die SAP-Systemlandschaft ermöglicht es Agenten, nicht nur E-Mails zu verschicken oder Zusammenfassungen zu erstellen, sondern wirklich datengetrieben auf Business-Daten zu arbeiten und komplexe Prozesse effizient durchzulaufen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-388278560"&gt;Der Weg zur Adoption von AI-Agents: Experimentieren, lernen, skalieren&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Wo stehen Unternehmen heute mit KI-Agenten? Jochen beobachtet zwei parallele Entwicklungen: Zum einen experimentieren alle Kunden, mit denen er spricht, auf verschiedenen Plattformen – von der BTP bis zu anderen Frameworks. Das ist wichtig, denn ein theoretisches Verständnis reicht nicht. Du musst einen Agenten gebaut und genutzt haben, um zu begreifen, was möglich ist – und was noch nicht.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Zum anderen starten viele mit &lt;STRONG&gt;Standard-Agenten&lt;/STRONG&gt;, um zu sehen, wie sich diese von klassischen Workflows unterscheiden und wie schnell sie im eigenen Unternehmen akzeptiert werden. Niemand wird 200 Agenten auf einmal ausrollen. Der Ansatz ist phasenweise: Wo habe ich gerade ein Problem? Welche Prozesse eignen sich für Agenten? Gibt es einen Standard-Agent, der passt, oder muss ich einen eigenen bauen?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Ein interessanter Tipp von Jochen: Schau dir dein &lt;STRONG&gt;Backlog&lt;/STRONG&gt; an. Gibt es geplante Features oder Prozesse, die du mit einem Agenten komplett neu denken könntest? Intern bei SAP wird genau das gemacht – Teams prüfen, ob geplante Entwicklungen mit Agenten besser oder effizienter umgesetzt werden können.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Auch sprechen wir kurz über die &lt;STRONG&gt;"Pilot-Falle"&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Es ist heute relativ einfach, einen Wow-Effekt zu erzeugen und einen experimentellen Agenten zu bauen. Die eigentliche Arbeit beginnt danach – beim Produktisieren, beim Enterprise-Ready-Machen. Wie gehst du damit um, wenn der Agent in einen Fehler läuft? Wie verhinderst du Endless-Loops, die Tokens und damit Geld verbrennen? Was passiert, wenn der Agent faktisch etwas Falsches macht (wie falsche Verbuchungen oder Meldungen), ohne dass ein technischer Fehler auftritt? Themen wie Traceability, Monitoring, Observability und Governance werden zentral.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-191765055"&gt;Kontrolle und Autonomie: Der Mensch bleibt im Loop&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Gerade am Anfang solltest du vorsichtig sein mit der Autonomie von Agenten. Jochen vergleicht es mit der Einstellung neuer Mitarbeiter: Du würdest auch nicht am ersten Tag sagen "Schreib mal das Unternehmens-Balance-Sheet und gib es raus, ohne dass ich draufschaue." Stattdessen bewegst du dich schrittweise vorwärts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Seine Entwickler machen das mit Coding-Agenten (Cursor, Cline) genauso: Am Anfang wollen sie jeden Code-Snippet sehen und bestätigen. Aber das Tool schreibt schneller Code, als sie lesen können. Nach sechs, sieben, acht erfolgreichen Durchläufen kommt der Punkt, wo sie sagen: "Okay, mach es automatisch, frag nicht mehr." Dann brauchen sie aber einen neuen Mechanismus zur Qualitätssicherung – &lt;STRONG&gt;Evals&lt;/STRONG&gt; (Evaluations).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Evals sind datenunterstützte Tests der Agenten, die kontinuierlich laufen und prüfen, ob die Qualität und wichtige Attribute eingehalten werden. Das sind im Prinzip Unit-Tests in Dauerschleife, mit komplexeren Datasets. Und hier zeigt sich wieder: Je mehr gute Daten du hast, desto präziser werden die Evals und desto höher die Output-Qualität des Agenten.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Der Ansatz ist also: Viele kleine Checks am Anfang, die sukzessive weniger werden. Wenn es weniger menschliche Checks werden, brauchst du mehr technische Checks im Hintergrund. Agenten sind nie 100% deterministisch – Fehler können passieren, und du brauchst immer irgendwo einen Checkpoint.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--4748450"&gt;Offene Standards und Zukunftsfähigkeit von KI Agenten&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;SAP setzt stark auf &lt;STRONG&gt;offene Standards&lt;/STRONG&gt; wie das &lt;STRONG&gt;Agent-to-Agent-Protokoll (A2A)&lt;/STRONG&gt;, bei dem SAP im Gründungskonsortium mit Google und anderen großen Unternehmen sitzt. Aktuell wird ausgelotet, was in so ein Protokoll gehört: Autorisierung, Kontextaustausch, welcher Agent darf welchen Agent rufen – besonders wichtig, wenn Agenten über Unternehmensgrenzen hinweg kommunizieren sollen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Auch das &lt;STRONG&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; ist in aller Munde. Jochen beschreibt es als semantischen Layer über eine API mit beeindruckend schneller Community-Adoption. Trotzdem gibt es noch offene Fragen zu Autorisierung, Governance, Discovery und Registry. Anthropic hat gerade eine Lösung für die Frage gelauncht, wo man die richtigen Tools findet, die zugänglich sind.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Die Philosophie bei SAP: &lt;STRONG&gt;Adaptivität&lt;/STRONG&gt; ist entscheidend. Genau wie beim Model Access, wo SAP von Anfang an auf mehrere Modelle statt auf eines gesetzt hat, gilt das auch für Agent-Frameworks und Protokolle. Es wird nicht das eine Framework geben, sondern mehrere – und du solltest in der Lage sein, flexibel zu wechseln und neue Entwicklungen komplementär mitzunehmen, ohne alles wegschmeißen zu müssen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-145992402"&gt;Praktische Tipps für den Einstieg&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Jochens wichtigster Rat: &lt;STRONG&gt;Anfangen ist wichtig&lt;/STRONG&gt;. Du musst nicht selbst coden können, aber du solltest verstehen, wie ein Agent aufgebaut ist. Für technisch Interessierte empfiehlt er, einen Agenten auf einem Low-Code-Framework zu bauen oder sich zumindest eine Schulung anzuschauen. Wichtig ist, die Traces zu verstehen – wie zerlegt der Agent ein Problem in Tasks? Wie kommt er zu seinen Lösungswegen?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Für Business-orientierte Personen ist es entscheidend, den &lt;STRONG&gt;Unterschied zwischen Workflow und Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt; zu begreifen: Bei einem Workflow kennst du den Weg zum Ziel genau (auch wenn es 100 If-Else-Verzweigungen sind). Bei einem Agent beschreibst du nur den Outcome – der Agent findet selbst heraus, wie er dahin kommt. Wenn du diesen Unterschied verstehst, entwickelst du ein Auge dafür, welche Business-Probleme sich für Agenten eignen.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Konkrete Empfehlungen:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Probiere bestehende Standard-Agenten aus und beobachte, was sie machen, wo sie stolpern&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Nutze den &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Innovation Guide&lt;/STRONG&gt; für Beispiele und Inspiration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Schau dir das &lt;STRONG&gt;App House Toolkit für Agent Design&lt;/STRONG&gt; an&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Absolviere Learning Journeys auf der SAP-Plattform (s. Shownotes unten)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Für Deep Dives: Der Kurs zu &lt;STRONG&gt;Agentic AI von &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;A class="" href="http://deeplearning.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;DeepLearning.AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/A&gt; (von KI OG Andrew Ng) oder der SAP-Kurs zu &lt;STRONG&gt;Knowledge Graphs&lt;/STRONG&gt; auf &lt;A class="" href="http://deeplearning.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;DeepLearning.AI&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Und vergiss nicht: Wenn ein Problem mit einem klassischen Workflow lösbar ist, solltest du das tun. Nicht alles muss ein Agent werden – das ist auch eine Frage des TCO (Total Cost of Ownership). Lass dich nicht vom "Agent-Washing" täuschen, wo Workflows als Agenten verkauft werden, nur weil eine Konversation davor geschaltet ist.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--50521103"&gt;Verantwortung und Ethik im Rahmen von KI Agenten&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Bei aller Begeisterung für die Technologie: Das Thema &lt;STRONG&gt;Responsible AI&lt;/STRONG&gt; bleibt zentral. Viele Mechanismen sind bereits technologisch eingebaut – Content-Filter gegen Hate Speech, Security-Features, Data Privacy. Aber bei Agenten musst du dir immer wieder die Frage stellen: Kann ich verantworten, was der Agent macht? Würde ich diese Aufgabe so auch an mein Team geben?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Besonders beim Umgang mit persönlichen Daten oder wenn Agenten Menschen beeinflussen, sind klare ethische Grenzen wichtig. Bei SAP gibt es dafür interne Prozesse und Governance-Strukturen. Der "Human in the Loop" ist nicht nur eine technische Notwendigkeit, sondern auch eine ethische – Menschen müssen an den richtigen Checkpoints eingebunden werden, um Kontrolle und Verantwortung zu behalten.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--247034608"&gt;Blick in die Zukunft von KI Agenten&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Wohin geht die Reise? Jochen sieht mehrere spannende Entwicklungen: Die &lt;STRONG&gt;Capabilities verschieben sich immer mehr in die Modelle&lt;/STRONG&gt; selbst – OpenAI hat gerade ein Agent Kit angekündigt, die Modelle werden von reinen LLMs zu echten Problemlösern. Das macht es umso wichtiger, sich nicht von einem Modell abhängig zu machen und flexibel zu bleiben.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Edge-Modelle&lt;/STRONG&gt; treiben Jochen besonders um: Die Modelle werden kleiner und brauchen weniger Rechenpower, während Devices immer leistungsfähiger werden. Was kann auf deinem Edge-Device passieren, ohne dass Daten ins Netz gehen müssen? Aus Data-Privacy-Sicht ist das mega spannend.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Die Interaktion zwischen Foundation-Modellen und der &lt;STRONG&gt;physischen Welt&lt;/STRONG&gt; wird relevant – Robotics ist ein Thema, auch wenn es noch dauert. Und dann gibt es die philosophische Frage: Wird es einen &lt;STRONG&gt;Super-Orchestrator&lt;/STRONG&gt; für alle Agenten geben oder eher ein intelligentes Netzwerk basierend auf offenen Standards? Jochen ist großer Fan der Netzwerk-Ökonomie – auch auf der technischen und Agent-Ebene.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Besonders faszinierend sind auch &lt;STRONG&gt;World Models&lt;/STRONG&gt;, wie sie Fei-Fei Li beschreibt. Wenn du dir anschaust, wie schnell Kinder in der realen Welt lernen, wird klar: Ein LLM, das sich nur der Sprache bedient, lässt vieles vermissen. Ein Verständnis des ganzen Raums – 3D, 4D mit Zeitachse – ermöglicht schnelleres Begreifen. Und das gilt auch im Business (und für Agenten): Teams mit mehr Kontextinformationen treffen bessere Entscheidungen. Je mehr verschiedene Informationen du in die Modelle einbringen kannst, desto besser die Prediction.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--443548113"&gt;Inspirierende Aussagen aus dem Podcast&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;"Ein Agent ist im Prinzip wie meine zehnjährigen Kinder: Ich sage ihnen, was ich erreichen will, und hoffe, dass sie rausfinden, wie sie dahin kommen – ohne dass ich jeden Schritt vorgeben muss."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;"Es gibt momentan sehr viel Agent-Washing. Nicht alles, was als Agent verkauft wird, ist wirklich agentic. Wenn du es mit einem Workflow lösen kannst, solltest du das tun."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;"Wir steuern in eine Welt, in der Code schreiben schneller geht als Code lesen. Das stellt uns vor fundamental andere Probleme."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;"Der Wow-Effekt mit Agenten ist heute schnell erreicht. Die eigentliche Arbeit beginnt danach – beim Produktisieren und Enterprise-Ready-Machen."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;"Kontext ist key – nicht nur für LLMs und Agenten, sondern auch für uns Menschen. Zu verstehen, was drumherum abgeht, ist die Grundlage für Adaptability."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;"Bei Agenten musst du dir immer fragen: Würde ich diese Aufgabe so auch an mein Team geben? Wenn nicht, solltest du es auch keinem Agenten überlassen."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;"Je mehr verschiedene Informationen du in die Modelle einbringen kannst, desto besser die Prediction. Deshalb sind World Models so spannend."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--640061618"&gt;Konkrete Tipps für die Praxis&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Für den Start:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Beginne mit Experimenten – baue oder nutze einen Agenten, um ein Gefühl für die Technologie zu bekommen&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Probiere Standard-Agenten aus, um zu sehen, was möglich ist und wie schnell sie in deinem Unternehmen akzeptiert werden&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Schaue dir dein Backlog an: Welche geplanten Features könntest du mit Agenten neu denken?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Für die Entwicklung:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Nutze das Joule Studio für schnelle Prototypen mit Enterprise-Grade-Features&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Denke in Outcomes, nicht in Schritten – beschreibe, was erreicht werden soll, nicht wie&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Statte Agenten mit den richtigen Tools aus, aber überfrachte sie nicht – zu viele Tools verschlechtern die Qualität&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Wähle das passende Modell: klein und günstig für einfache Tasks, leistungsstark für komplexe Reasoning-Aufgaben&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Für die Skalierung:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Starte mit vielen kleinen Human-in-the-Loop-Checkpoints und reduziere sie schrittweise&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Baue technische Checks (Evals) auf, wenn menschliche Checks weniger werden&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Implementiere Monitoring, Observability und Audit-Logs von Anfang an&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Denke an Governance: Was passiert bei Fehlern? Wie verhinderst du Endless-Loops?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Für die Strategie:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class=""&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Priorisiere Use Cases nach Business Value, nicht nach technischer Coolness&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Unterscheide klar: Workflow oder Agent? Nutze Agenten nur dort, wo Flexibilität und Dynamik nötig sind&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Bleibe adaptiv und unabhängig von einzelnen Modellen oder Frameworks&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Investiere in gute Datengrundlagen – die richtigen Daten zur richtigen Zeit sind entscheidend&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--836575123"&gt;Resümee: Die Zukunft ist agentic – aber mit Augenmaß&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;KI-Agenten sind keine Science-Fiction mehr, sondern Realität im Enterprise-Kontext. Bei SAP sind sie bereits in allen möglichen Lösungen announced, von Finance über HR bis zu technischen Use Cases. Die Technologie ist beeindruckend einfach von der Bedienung aber sehr mächtig: Agenten können komplexe Aufgaben eigenständig lösen, sich dynamisch an veränderte Bedingungen anpassen und Prozesse augmentieren, die früher viel manuelle Arbeit erforderten.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Aber – und das ist die zentrale Botschaft von Jochen Schneider – nicht alles sollte oder muss zum Agenten werden. Die Kunst liegt darin, zu erkennen, wo Agenten echten Mehrwert schaffen und wo klassische Workflows effizienter sind. Es geht nicht darum, dem Hype zu verfallen, sondern Business Value zu schaffen und Probleme zu lösen, die heute nicht oder nicht so gut lösbar sind.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Und was man sieht: viele Inhalte der vergangene Gespräche im Podcast von KI Ethik, humanzetrierten Design oder KI Strategie sind auch im Kontext von Agenten zentral. BTW: Lernangebote speziell für den &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-training-and-change-management-blog-posts/sap-ai-training-und-sap-ai-skills-self-assessment/ba-p/14220337" target="_blank"&gt;SAP AI Bereich haben hier im Blog&lt;/A&gt; gesammelt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Ich habe mich auf diesen Podcast mit Recherche und einem E-Learning von &lt;A class="" href="http://deeplearning.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;deeplearning.ai&lt;/A&gt; zu AgenticAI vorbereit. Der nächste Schritt ist, dass ich mir eigene Agenten bastele. Mir fällt es noch einfacher, Business Use Cases zu sehen anstatt für den persönlichen Gebrauch - denn mir reichen oft GPTs oder eben das Nutzen von verschiedenen LLMs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Oder wie seht Ihr das?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--1033088628"&gt;Ressourcen und weiterführende Links&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjochen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Jochen Schneider auf LinkedIn&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-agents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Überblick: Joule Agents&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-foundation-os/knowledge-graph.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Infos zu SAP Knowledge Graph&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/germany/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Website zu Joule-KI-Agenten&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/joule-studio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Infos zu Joule Studio&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://learning.sap.com/courses/boosting-ai-driven-business-transformation-with-joule-agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Kostenfreies E-Learning: Boost...&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Lennys Podcast&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/agentic-ai/lesson/pu5xbv/welcome!" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;E-Learning zu Agentic AI&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/knowledge-graphs-for-ai-agent-api-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Short course: Knowledge Graphs...&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://apphaus.sap.com/resource/ai-innovation-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Apphaus AI Innovation Tool...&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A class="" href="https://www.sap.com/topics/innovation-guide/h2#business-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Innovation Guide HJ2 2025&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-training-and-change-management-blog-posts/sap-ai-training-und-sap-ai-skills-self-assessment/ba-p/14220337" target="_blank"&gt;Sammlung von AI Lernangeboten&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;In today’s business landscape, where efficiency and intuitive user experiences are more critical than ever, SAP Signavio is constantly embedding new generative AI capabilities into its &lt;A title="process analysis and mining" href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-signavio-november-2025-release-sap-signavio-process-insights-and/ba-p/14250661" target="_self"&gt;process analysis and mining,&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-signavio-process-and-journey-modeling-what-s-new-in-the-november/ba-p/14246178" target="_self"&gt;modeling&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-signavio-november-2025-product-release-process-transformation/ba-p/14255302" target="_blank"&gt;transformation management&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;solutions. These innovations can dramatically accelerate and simplify the way you drive transformation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the upcoming general availability of Joule in SAP Signavio solutions and the introduction of new Joule Agents, SAP Signavio is also making significant advancements towards conversational process management. As a user, you can work more efficiently and productively by simply describing your ideas, asking questions, or instructing Joule on what to do.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Importantly, SAP Signavio is not only developing agents for its own solutions but is also committed to helping you deploy and manage AI agents - whether from SAP, SAP Signavio, or third-party providers. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;New Joule Agents : &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beta Program Starting December 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;Two Joule Agents have been introduced with the November release, enabling users to automate repetitive tasks, accelerate content discovery, and enhance user onboarding. These agents leverage agentic AI to help process owners and analysts reduce information overload and focus on decision-making, while new users benefit from a smoother start.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-align-justify" style="text-align : justify;"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Process Content Recommender Agent:&lt;/STRONG&gt; This agent reasons over thousands of process best practices - both from SAP and custom process models - to answer user questions and provide tailored process content recommendations.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;At Sapphire 2025, SAP &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/build-deploy-and-extend-ai-agents-with-joule-studio/ba-p/14105964" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;announced&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; Joule Studio, a capability in SAP Build that enables developers to create Joule agents and skills. Deeply grounded in business data, these agents orchestrate workflows across heterogenous landscapes to deliver accurate outcomes. Joule Studio delivers an agent runtime with built-in data protection guardrails, multi-LLM support, and context retention across tasks for scalable, secure execution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Today, we are announcing additional capabilities that will equip developers with a comprehensive development tool kit to build scalable agentic AI for their business. We are introducing vibe coding experience to create not only conversational but also system-triggered AI agents. Instead of building from scratch, developers can also extend ready-to-use Joule agents as per their business needs. Joule Studio will also support open standards such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. These advances empower developers to deliver end-to-end agentic automation with greater speed, flexibility, and control. See what our customers and partners from the beta program (Q3 2025) have to say:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“With Joule Studio, we could build powerful agents in three weeks. It is an intuitive, no‑code environment that enables system connectivity across SAP and non‑SAP critical environments, for a hybrid landscapes where data resides in multiple modules.”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Gianluca Simeone, VP - Global SAP CTIO and Gen-AI Leader at Capgemini&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“Nestle, SAP, and IBM worked together on a supply chain Agentic AI PoC. With the agent builder capability in Joule Studio, we created this POC bringing in data from SAP and non-SAP sources to create an agent that will automate our complex Order fulfillment processes”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;- Pablo Nill, Sr Product Group Manager, Nestle&amp;nbsp;&lt;/I&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;“&lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;With Joule Studio, agentic innovation moves closer to the heart of operations. At KPMG, we’re helping to shape trusted solutions that transform business context into measurable value by building specialized AI agents for fulfillment orchestration, supply chain management, and more”.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;FONT color="#808080"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;Valentino Köster, Global Head of SAP360 Program &amp;amp; AI, KPMG AG WPG, Germany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Fast‑Tracking Ideas into Agents: Empowering Developers with AI&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;To lower the barrier to AI adoption, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Joule Studio provides AI &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;assistance&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; in the&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt; design-time experience of creating agents. Developers can use natural language to share their requirements with Joule copilot and get contextual recommendations for agent definition, tools, and other configurations, tailored to their specific needs. For example, Joule may suggest and add relevant Joule skills to custom Joule agents. This makes agent creation more accessible and accelerates time-to-value.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Image 1: AI-assistance in Joule Studio" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335644iF76BF32073888545/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Vibe coding_agent builder (1).png" alt="Image 1: AI-assistance in Joule Studio" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Image 1: AI-assistance in Joule Studio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Cross-Ecosystem Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;One of the most significant updates is Joule Studio’s support for MCP, an open standard that provides a unified way to connect AI agents with external systems. This breaks down traditional application silos and enables cross-platform agent execution. In Joule Studio, you can configure connectivity to external MCP servers, allowing agents to use third-party tools and applications. For example, a support agent that you built in Joule Studio can retrieve ticket information from a third-party IT service platform exposed via MCP. This open integration empowers AI agents to act as central, intelligent orchestrators, managing complex workflows across diverse systems without the need for custom integrations. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Image 2: Configuration of tools, MCP servers, and models for agent design" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335645i946D84D0AC265003/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="MCP Servers and tools (1).png" alt="Image 2: Configuration of tools, MCP servers, and models for agent design" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Image 2: Configuration of tools, MCP servers, and models for agent design&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Proactive Agentic Automation with System-Triggered Agents&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule Studio will support the creation of system-triggered AI agents that operate autonomously with no human input. Triggers such as business events, APIs, and schedules will be supported for agents to be initiated. This elevates agents from being reactive to proactive collaborators, capable of initiating actions like inventory monitoring and initiating purchase orders for low stock items or incident response. That enables true end-to-end automation of business processes with minimal human intervention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Image 3: Add triggers for custom agents" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335646i0D727232784347EE/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="System Triggers (1).png" alt="Image 3: Add triggers for custom agents" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Image 3: Add triggers for custom agents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Adapt Pre-Built, SAP-Delivered Agents to Your Enterprise&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In Joule Studio, developers will be able to extend ready-to-use Joule agents by adding additional tools and custom skills as pre- and post-processing steps. For example, extend an Accounts Receivable Agent, which analyzes overdue receivables and follows up with customers, by grounding it in your order handling policy for informed decision making. This allows you to tailor ready-to-use Joule agents to your unique business requirements.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Image 4: Extending ready-to-use Joule agents" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335647i37FA4B3929E54169/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Act I - 29.png" alt="Image 4: Extending ready-to-use Joule agents" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Image 4: Extending ready-to-use Joule agents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size="5"&gt;Getting Started with agent builder in Joule Studio&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The agent builder will be generally available in December 2025 with support for MCP, agent as a tool, vibe coding, and document grounding part of first release.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;At SAP TechEd 2025, we announced four key innovations that redefine the ABAP Cloud development experience:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-2022695882"&gt;Key highlights:&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP is entering the era of Agentic AI&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP LLMs will be available on GenAI Hub&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP AI capabilities will be supported in earlier releases (SAP S/4HANA Private Edition 2021 and later)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;ABAP is embracing an open IDE strategy — with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for ABAP on the way&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;These innovations mark a major step forward in making ABAP development even more intelligent, flexible, and efficient.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Generative AI has already profoundly changed our world. The arrival of Agentic AI marks the beginning of a major technological transformation. We are entering a new era. For enterprise development, this means rethinking the very foundations of our programming models while upholding SAP’s core commitments to security, scalability, and reliability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At SAP TechEd 2025, the spotlight is on how AI and Agentic capabilities are revolutionizing ABAP development. By embracing these advancements, developers can unlock intelligent automation, boost productivity, and build smarter, more resilient enterprise solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1438934220"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1242420715"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A New Era for ABAP Development&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;ABAP is evolving alongside rapid advances in AI and development tooling. With these new innovations, we are extending the reach of ABAP AI, enabling agentic development, and delivering a modern, IDE-agnostic experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1174989929"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-978476424"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP - Now Powered by Agentic AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, ABAP AI capabilities are available as individual Joule skills, offering valuable automation and insights to developers. To further enhance the development workflow and unlock new levels of productivity, we are introducing Agents for ABAP. All agents will be able to interact with one another through a new Agentic AI architecture in ABAP’s backbone technology components. With this innovation, ABAP coding agents will actively assist developers throughout the entire development process — from code generation to refactoring and transformation — enabling seamless end-to-end automation and agentic collaboration.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 16.51.31.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336120i8A72AA62BB3C63E2/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 16.51.31.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 16.51.31.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;A new &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP MCP server&lt;/STRONG&gt; will expose ABAP development capabilities, both with and without embedded AI, to agents. Existing ABAP AI use cases will be refined and offered as tools or as dedicated ABAP agents via MCP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Imagine an ABAP development experience where intelligent agents actively support you every step of the way—boosting productivity and accelerating development tasks through smart, agentic assistance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;General availability is planned for &lt;STRONG&gt;Q2, 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The initial scope focuses on &lt;STRONG&gt;VS Code for ABAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, with &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse&lt;/STRONG&gt; to follow.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-781962919"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-585449414"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP AI LLMs on GenAI Hub &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To empower customers and partners to &lt;STRONG&gt;build custom, AI-driven developer productivity use cases&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we will make our ABAP AI large language models (LLMs) available on the GenAI Hub.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Trained on more than 250 million lines of ABAP code, 30 million lines of CDS code, and extensive technical documentation, these LLMs are purpose-built to &lt;STRONG&gt;explain&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;generate&lt;/STRONG&gt; (ghost text) &lt;STRONG&gt;modern ABAP code&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Release is planned for &lt;STRONG&gt;Q4 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;, underscoring our commitment to openness and collaboration within the SAP ecosystem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-388935909"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-192422404"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Availability of ABAP AI Capabilities in Lower Releases&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H4 id="toc-hId-254074337"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;(SAP S/4HANA Private Edition&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2021, 2022, and 2023)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI-driven development is transforming how organizations extend SAP S/4HANA. To make AI available more broadly, ABAP AI capabilities will soon be offered for&lt;STRONG&gt; SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt; From a technology perspective, we will follow a release independent approach by offering ABAP AI capabilities as an application that can be deployed side-by-side.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This allows ABAP developers in S/4HANA systems to increase productivity, accelerate custom code transformation, and continuously access the latest capabilities — all while keeping their core system stable. The real strength of this new ABAP AI application is that it will be combined with the Agentic AI tooling described above.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;General availability is planned for &lt;STRONG&gt;Q2 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt;, marking a significant milestone in making AI innovation more accessible to every S/4HANA customer.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-146649751"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--49863754"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;VS Code for ABAP is coming&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;To meet developers where they are, &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Cloud development &lt;/STRONG&gt;is coming to Visual Studio Code — one of the world’s most widely used IDEs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="ABAPinVSCode_TechEd25_Public_Picture.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336182iC2885AE9514C9592/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="ABAPinVSCode_TechEd25_Public_Picture.png" alt="ABAPinVSCode_TechEd25_Public_Picture.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The new &lt;STRONG&gt;ABAP Cloud Extension for VS Code&lt;/STRONG&gt; delivers a streamlined, file-based development experience with built-in AI assistance. It is powered by an ABAP language server, initially supporting Fiori UI Service development and expanding to additional ABAP Cloud scenarios over time.&lt;BR /&gt;This move brings ABAP development into the same environment where developers already build with &lt;STRONG&gt;UI5 and CAP&lt;/STRONG&gt;, enabling a unified, AI-enhanced experience across SAP technologies. Eclipse for ABAP will remain our flagship IDE for full-fledged ABAP development.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;General availability is planned for &lt;STRONG&gt;Q2, 2026&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId--246377259"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--149487757"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Join the Future of ABAP Development&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;These four innovations mark a major step toward a unified, intelligent, and modern ABAP development experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With Agentic AI, release-independent ABAP AI capabilities, and VS Code for ABAP, we’re redefining how developers create intelligent enterprise solutions with ABAP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Learn more about the new developments in ABAP &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/abap/environment.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With the request to further increase the level of automation in modern and high-performance warehouses integration of robotics to warehouse management solutions becomes increasingly relevant.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This demand is leading to the question on how to best and most efficiently integrate robotics, fleet management systems and multi-agent orchestration platforms to SAP Extended Warehouse Management for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With this blog post, we would like to discuss some of the most important and relevant questions of the topic of robotic integration to SAP EWM.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="gunther_sanchez_0-1762353258717.jpeg" style="width: 900px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/336509iA3AB3394518ECF0C/image-dimensions/900x251/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="900" height="251" role="button" title="gunther_sanchez_0-1762353258717.jpeg" alt="gunther_sanchez_0-1762353258717.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What is the right integration technology to integrate robotic systems to SAP EWM?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With SAP EWM there are multiple channels and interfacing options that should be evaluated when integrating robotics and the corresponding fleet management systems.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Typically, robot platforms are integrated via OData APIs, EWM-WCU IDOC interface or via SOAP Webservices and RFCs. Further AGV, AMR and robots can be integrated using MFS over TCP/IP and telegram-based communication.

&lt;STRONG&gt;Event-Driven Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The event-driven integration considers direct distribution of relevant workload via the &lt;A href="https://api.sap.com/event/sap-s4-OP_WAREHOUSEORDEREVENTS-v1/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Warehouse Order Business Event&lt;/A&gt; (available with SAP S/4HANA 2025, FPS0) to the SAP Event Mesh on SAP BTP. From the SAP Event Mesh the Fleet Manager System (FMS) can pick-up the relevant Warehouse Order creation, cancelation, activation or deletion events to initiate retrieving relevant Warehouse Orders. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The integration follows the following steps:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create warehouse task/- order for movement from source to destination&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Source and Destination are FMS managed&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Determine FMS relevant queue for execution&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Push Warehouse Order Business Event to SAP Event Mesh&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;FMS to register for the relevant Warehouse Order Business Event from SAP Event Mesh&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Perform Warehouse Order/Warehouse Tasks retrieval from FMS for relevant Warehouse Orders via the Warehousing API (GET)&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Start execution of the Warehouse Order/Warehouse Tasks by updating the operating resource to the Warehouse Order (e.g. FMS or specific robot-unit) by the Warehousing API (POST) (optional) &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Confirm Warehouse Order/Warehouse Tasks by FMS by the Warehousing API

Orders/Warehouse Tasks to a Fleet Management System (FMS) or retrieve Warehouse Orders/Tasks by the Fleet Management System (FMS).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The integration follows the following steps:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create warehouse task/- order for movement from source to destination&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Source and Destination are FMS managed&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Determine FMS relevant queue for execution&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;FMS to select open Warehouse Orders/Warehouse Tasks regularly from queue via EWM interface (e.g. ODATA-service, WebService, IDoc).&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Start execution of the Warehouse Order/Warehouse Tasks by setting updating the operating resource to the Warehouse Order (e.g. FMS or specific

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction to Business Data Cloud:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP Business Data Cloud was introduced on&amp;nbsp;February 13 2025 as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution fully managed by SAP.&amp;nbsp;SAP Business Data Cloud is a data &amp;amp; analytics platform that harmonizes all data from SAP and non-SAP sources into a unified semantic layer of trusted data that governs, connects and share data securely across systems or cloud. By integrating&amp;nbsp;powerful functionality of SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud, and SAP Databricks and&amp;nbsp;SAP Business Warehouse.&amp;nbsp;It empowers businesses to break data silos to power advanced AI and&amp;nbsp;analytics.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why was Business data cloud introduced?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;easier&amp;nbsp;access to SAP data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;without the need for complex data preparation steps such as extraction, building semantics, transformation and loading data for analytics.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&lt;STRONG&gt; access to&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;SAP data from all Line of Business (LoB)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;applications, such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Ariba without the need of 3rd party connector &amp;amp; tool.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;a unified&amp;nbsp;business view&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the data regardless of which SAP application it originated from without making harmonization difficult and holds its&amp;nbsp;original business context without any change.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;accelerate AI with trusted and secure&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;that they can use to build reliable AI applications to accelerate innovation and insights with AI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;faster access to&amp;nbsp;SAP data insights&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;by removing data preparation and dashboard building steps.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To get&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;a Simplified Landscape&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;by reducing multiple tools, silos and complex tasks of manual data preparation, development and analytics.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Features &amp;amp;

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;How AI is Transforming Your Digital Workspace &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Introduction&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The modern workplace has changed dramatically. Employees no longer rely solely on static intranets or scattered collaboration tools. Instead, they expect a connected, personalized experience that helps them cut through the noise and focus on meaningful work. Enter artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI isn’t just another layer of technology- it’s rapidly becoming the backbone of digital workspaces. By surfacing the right information at the right time, automating repetitive tasks, and enabling smarter collaboration and self-service, AI is redefining how we work, learn, and engage every day.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;With digital workspaces in &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Build/pd-p/73555000100700001491" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1181-1"&gt;SAP Build&lt;/a&gt;, these AI capabilities are already available today—helping organizations deliver intelligent, personalized employee experiences out of the box&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Rise of AI in the Digital Workspace&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For years, digital workspaces have been a central hub for business applications, documents, apps, and communications in one place. Useful—but often overwhelming. Employees spent as much time searching for information as they did, acting on it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Now, AI is filling the gaps. With intelligent copilots, content curation, and contextual answers, digital workspaces like &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/workzone.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP Build Work Zone&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;have evolved from being a &lt;EM&gt;destination for information&lt;/EM&gt; into an &lt;EM&gt;engine for productivity and engagement&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Core AI features available today in SAP Build digital workspaces&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;1. &lt;STRONG&gt;Chatbots &amp;amp; Virtual Assistants&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;With Joule, SAP’s AI copilot, workspace users can access information instantly. From answering HR questions to surfacing insights from reports, employees can rely on conversational AI to get what they need instantaneously.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Joule, SAP's AI copilot integrated into the digital workspace" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/335660i043D988E0B0B926E/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Joule in Work Zone 10292025.png" alt="Joule, SAP's AI copilot integrated into the digital workspace" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Joule, SAP's AI copilot integrated into the digital workspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;2. &lt;STRONG&gt;Task completion with Joule Skills&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;One can enhance Joule capabilities by creating skills for it in &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/Joule+Studio/pd-p/2a5c5654-c2ac-414e-aaff-335367ed0215" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1294-1"&gt;Joule Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Connected with SAP systems and third-party applications, Joule can complete tasks like submitting time-off requests, approving workflows, or surfacing KPI dashboards—all from a single interface&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_e2221ari" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Document Grounding Capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;Joule ensures information is both contextual and reliable when using workspace content to ground AI responses. For example, employees can ask “What’s our travel policy in Europe?” and receive an AI response sourced directly from workspace content or SAP SuccessFactors policies when it is enabled as an AI source.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_2wde0pwi" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Content generation and summarization using generative AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP Build leverages generative AI to help users create and refine content—whether drafting announcements, summarizing updates, or suggesting language for a blog post—directly within the workspace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_25evdp5n" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_yc7or6th" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Real-Life Examples&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;in Action&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Information access with grounded responses&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Joule responds with answers grounded in the specific workspace content. Employees can query Joule with specific questions like “What is the holiday plan for next year in Germany" or “how can I apply for a sabbatical leave? Point me to the relevant file”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Smart document summaries&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Integrated AI services capture the highlights of a workspace document—policy highlights, key insights from data, or high-level overview of a blog.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Workflow Automation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;From within SAP Build workspace, an employee can ask Joule to “create a purchase order” or “show current pipeline metrics.” The copilot triggers the workflow in connected SAP systems, making productivity seamless.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Intelligent content curation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Users can easily create blog posts, feed posts or even knowledge articles in the workspace using the native AI features with simple prompts like “create a workspace feed reminding members to fill their timesheet in a funny and casual tone”.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Business Impact&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Faster Information Access&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Joule makes information searches 95% faster by surfacing insights and data instantly. Grounded insights reduce time spent searching for answers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reduced Manual Effort&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Generative AI-assisted summarization and content creation free up employee time.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Better Governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;: AI responses in SAP are backed by enterprise content, ensuring compliance and accuracy.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Preparing for the AI-Powered Workspace&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Adopting AI in digital workspaces is not just about flipping a switch—it’s about preparing your organization:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Change Management&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Train employees to adopt AI workflows and copilots in their daily work.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Governance&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Define guardrails for AI-generated content, data privacy, and security.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Integration&lt;/STRONG&gt;: Maximize value by connecting SAP Build with existing SAP and non-SAP applications, making copilots more powerful.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;AI is no longer a future trend; it’s already embedded in the digital workspaces employees use today. With embedded AI&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/Joule/pd-p/d0136351-8a9c-4881-aebc-bf414b785998" class="lia-product-mention" data-product="1207-1"&gt;Joule&lt;/a&gt;, organizations don’t just imagine an intelligent workspace—they experience it&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By weaving AI into daily workflows—whether through copilots, recommended learning, or curated content—SAP Build helps organizations unlock productivity, agility, and engagement at scale.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ready to take the next step?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Learn more about these capabilities and their implementation from the following resources:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-and-automation-blog-posts/joule-is-now-integrated-into-sap-build-work-zone/ba-p/13961162" target="_blank"&gt;Joule integration with Work Zone&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-build-work-zone-gets-even-more-powerful-with-ai-powered-capabilities/ba-p/14180971" target="_blank"&gt;SAP Build Work Zone Gets Even More Powerful with AI-Powered Capabilities&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/integrating-joule-with-sap/set-up-document-grounding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Set Up Document Grounding | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-advanced-edition/sap-build-work-zone-advanced-edition/integration-with-document-grounding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Integration With Document Grounding | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-advanced-edition/sap-build-work-zone-advanced-edition/enabling-ai-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Enabling AI Features | SAP Help Portal&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1764525792"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Setting up Document Grounding for Build Workzone Advanced&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Document grounding (SAP’s implementation of RAG) is a foundational Joule capability which can provide more comprehensive responses by drawing from business documents located in SAP and third-party repositories.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;Grounding is a service designed to handle data-related tasks, such as grounding and retrieval, using vector databases. It provides specialized data retrieval through these databases, grounding the retrieval process with your own external and context-relevant data. Grounding combines generative AI capabilities with the ability to use real-time, precise data to improve decision-making and business operations for specific AI-driven business solutions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Grounding converts user provided documents into vector representations which are stored as a database. The indexing pipeline preprocesses unstructured and semi structured data into chunks and embeddings and the retrieval pipeline takes incoming user queries and converts them into vector representations. The query vectors are used to search the database and retrieval relevant information.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Before triggering the setup process, make sure that you’ve purchased the AI Unit SKU (8019164) OR AI Units SKU - 8018592.

    <content>&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1763849034"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background Information&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;As a billing clerk, managing billing documents with posting issues can be frustrating sometime. Fortunately, Joule can streamline the process, making it more efficient and less stressful to resolves the posting issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Posting issues often arise when billing documents cannot be posted to the financial account due to errors like closed posting periods. Common errors include accounting errors (F5/286 and F5/903), which occur when the billing date falls outside the open period.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule is an AI copilot designed to enhance interaction with SAP business systems. Joule delivers a unified user experience across SAP's solutions, offering conversational interactions to streamline information access, automate business processes, and improve both employee and customer satisfaction. For more information, see &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/joule-guide/what-is-joule" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What Is Joule&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1567335529"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Ensure you have the &lt;STRONG&gt;Sales - Billing Documents&lt;/STRONG&gt; business catalog (&lt;EM&gt;SAP_SD_BC_BIL_DOC_PC&lt;/EM&gt;) assigned. The &lt;STRONG&gt;Billing Clerk&lt;/STRONG&gt; role template (&lt;EM&gt;SAP_BR_BILLING_CLERK&lt;/EM&gt;) includes this catalog by default.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Set up Joule in your environment. For more information, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/integrating-joule/initial-setup" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Initial Setup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1370822024"&gt;Implementation Details&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Follow the steps below to try out this feature:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Log in to your Fiori Launchpad as a &lt;STRONG&gt;Billing Clerk&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Launch Joule. The method for launching Joule differs depending on your platform.

You can narrow down your searching results by specifying criteria such as document type, issue type, or sales organization. Note that only the billing documents with accounting access error will be listed here.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Use the &lt;STRONG&gt;Post&lt;/STRONG&gt; button or chat commands to post a document. Only one document can be posted at a time.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Review the error message for more details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;As an alternative solution, you can adjust the billing date to a valid date using the quick buttons. When the posting error is resolved, the document will be automatically posted. You can open the billing document to confirm the changes.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and resolve posting issues, ensuring a smooth billing process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Watch the following video for step-by-step instruction:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_t2lq0d80" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

Acting as a knowledgeable digital associate, it understands everything from specific requests—such as “I need a lightweight rain jacket”—to broader needs like “I’m planning a beach vacation.” The agent instantly provides tailored responses, including details about product features, compatibility, and recommendations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Configuration is flexible, you can integrate the Shopping Agent directly into your online catalog using SAP CX AI Toolkit, and the agent converses in the customer’s language. Purpose-built for both B2B and B2C scenarios (activated via API configuration), the Shopping Agent proactively interacts with customers, refining product suggestions through relevant follow-up questions and guiding them throughout their shopping experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Capabilities of the Shopping Agent include:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Helping customers find and compare products using conversational AI.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Understanding and processing complex customer queries through intuitive dialogue.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Integrating seamlessly with your e-commerce storefront via a robust, flexible API.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Knowledge Base Integration:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The Shopping Agent can process unstructured data in varied formats as part of its knowledge base. By uploading product manuals, catalogs, or specification documents (PDF, image, text, spreadsheet formats, etc.) to SAP Commerce Cloud, you arm the agent with deep, detailed product knowledge to answer nuanced customer queries.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Digital Service Agent: Intelligent Post-Purchase Support&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Digital Service Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;is designed to deliver top-tier, automated customer support in natural language. Leveraging specific business knowledge sources—configured by your administrator—it answers post-purchase inquiries, resolving common issues and freeing up your service team for escalated cases.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This agent can operate solo or alongside the Shopping Agent, providing unified and continuous support throughout a customer’s lifecycle. For example, after a purchase, a customer with a warranty question interacts with the Digital Service Agent, who pulls relevant information—even translating responses if needed for multilingual scenarios.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Key Capabilities of the Digital Service Agent include:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Operating 24/7 to provide answers using precise business knowledge sources (manuals, FAQs, service tickets).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Handling service-related requests such as checking order status, processing returns, or addressing product issues.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Assisting in both B2B and B2C environments, with API-driven flexibility.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Comparison: Shopping Agent vs. Digital Service Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="589"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Feature&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Shopping Agent (Digital Sales Associate)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Digital Service Agent (Customer Support)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Primary Goal&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Drive sales, product discovery, pre-purchase assistance&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Resolve service issues, post-purchase customer support&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key Functions&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Recommends products; provides features/specs/compatibility info&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Answers inquiries (warranties, returns, order status); FAQs&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Data Sources&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Product catalog &amp;amp; related documents/media&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Knowledge base, service tickets, admin-configured sources&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Integration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Direct commerce storefront integration&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Standalone or in tandem with Shopping Agent&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Focus&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Product- and sales-oriented&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;P&gt;Service- and resolution-oriented&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In essence, the Shopping Agent is your digital sales expert, while the Digital Service Agent is your first-responder customer service assistant. Integrated together, they deliver a seamless, unified customer experience across all stages of the journey.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Conclusion&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;SAP CX AI Toolkit is more than a set of AI tools—it’s an innovation engine for your customer experience strategy. With deep integration, robust security, and persona-driven features, businesses can transform the way data is leveraged to create exceptional customer and employee experiences.
