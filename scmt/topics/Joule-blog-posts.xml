    <content>&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1635565995"&gt;Flashback: the feature&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;This is a &lt;EM&gt;"making of"&lt;/EM&gt; article about the implementation of the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="andale mono,times"&gt;/ui5-create-app&lt;/FONT&gt; slash command available within Joule in SAP Build Code. In short, this new feature enables a conversation between AI assistant and application developer about a new freestyle UI5 application to build, with a full-fledged best-practice application starting point as result.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To see screenshots of this feature in action and understand it better, feel invited to read &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-in-sap-build-code-can-now-create-freestyle-ui5-apps/ba-p/14264445" target="_self"&gt;my previous blog post&lt;/A&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;If you are just here for the background and AI-related learnings—go ahead!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1439052490"&gt;General considerations&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;With open‑ended prompting, users aren’t restricted to predefined interactions. The user could ask for &lt;EM&gt;anything&lt;/EM&gt;. In contrast to traditional programming, a prompt input field can’t be handled with a sprawling web of if/else logic trying to cover all possible use-cases. Attempting this will lead to a frustrating user experience where the user often gets an "I do not understand your request".&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some developers try to mimic this traditional programming pattern when crafting prompts and contexts for LLMs, telling an LLM "&lt;EM&gt;if the user asks for x, then answer y&lt;/EM&gt;". Instead, as demonstrated below, tell the LLM what it &lt;EM&gt;can&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;cannot&lt;/EM&gt; do and give it a goal to achieve. It's "smart" enough to figure out a suitable response to whatever the user will throw at it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1242538985"&gt;A fundamental choice&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Looking at this specific feature in the specific environment, the implementation options on the table were (for a variety of reasons) these two:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Either just provide a system prompt (a prompt that is added behind the scenes in addition to what the user typed) without interfering with the specific prompts and replies entered during the conversation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Or adopt a new way of creating an "agentic" multi-step execution plan. Similar to a guided activity, this would allow phases of data collection, possibly in different steps for different data, then an app creation step and so forth.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Surely "agentic" and "well-defined steps" sound good for app creation from a template, no? In fact, the initial implementation started like this, but it was soon apparent that this would neither provide the expected flexibility nor allow for a truly intelligent app creation experience. Defining phases in which to acquire specific information and having the application code created at a specific stage in this process did not feel right. The user would still feel like clicking through a traditional template creation process, as something specific was expected from the user at every stage, instead of giving the user the freedom to tweak every aspect at every stage. The true power of AI, on the other hand, would be totally underused.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But then again... just a system prompt and that's it? No file read access to explore the environment, no dynamically updated instructions? Is this enough for an intelligent coding assistant?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1046025480"&gt;Creating an "AI agent" out of nothing&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consider the now common definition of an "AI agent" which has settled over the course of this year: it's nothing more than "&lt;A href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395657404_An_LLM_Agent_Runs_Tools_in_a_Loop_to_Achieve_a_Goal_A_Comprehensive_Semantic_Framework_for_Defining_AI_Agents_and_Agentic_Systems_by_Simon_Willison_and_Leading_Research_Laboratories" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;an LLM with tools, called in a loop to achieve a goal&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;". The chat conversation provided by Joule can be our loop, an application template with its parameters is the tool and the goal of assisting the developer to create an app can be stated in the system prompt. Of course a real &lt;EM&gt;autonomous&lt;/EM&gt; agent would require the loop to run without user interaction, but for this feature a loop involving the user is just right.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The system prompt used for this feature literally includes: "&lt;EM&gt;Y&lt;SPAN&gt;ou help users create new UI5 applications by analyzing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;their requirements and filling the project template parameters. [...]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Your goal is to gather all necessary information to create a new UI5 application.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The application will be generated from a template which&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;has only one page and a hardcoded UI, but can optionally display data from an OData V4 service. [...]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;You cannot create the application yourself, but the user will see a preview...&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;". There you have it: the goal and the tool!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;It then goes on with some behavioral hints and of course a detailed description of what exactly the template parameters do. Finally, it requests &lt;EM&gt;each reply&lt;/EM&gt; to contain a JSON object with the best choice of template parameters according to the current understanding of the user request. The JSON object could look like this example:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;{&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;   "appNamespace": "com.myorg.myapp",&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;   "basePath": "/path/to/workspace",&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
   "createAppDirectory": true,&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;   "framework": "SAPUI5",&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN&gt;   "frameworkVersion": "1.136.0",&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN&gt;   "author": "John Doe",&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN&gt;   "oDataV4Url": "https://services.odata.org/TripPinRESTierService/(S(s5xrj1t51r41s3ooztsynysq))/",&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN&gt;   "oDataEntitySet": "Airports",&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN&gt;   "entityProperties": ["Name", "Address"],&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN&gt;   "runNpmInstall": true,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN&gt;   "initializeGitRepository": true,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN&gt;   "typescript": true&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;SPAN&gt;}&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This JSON object is removed from the LLM response before displaying it, then the application is generated with these parameters, so the user can accept it or request changes. In an environment where tools with a well-defined interface like MCP servers are not enabled, this JSON object as part of the conversation is how the integration with the templating tool is achieved. It's basically a use-case-tailored alternative to MCP.&amp;nbsp; A note to make this very clear: this environment is &lt;EM&gt;not&lt;/EM&gt; the official SAP Joule assistant running inside end-user applications, as it is now also being enabled for development by customers. Instead, it is a sort of predecessor implementation specifically available in SAP Build Code since spring 2024 and about to be replaced by advanced solutions. So do not draw conclusions about SAP Joule based on this article.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Some of these parameters in the JSON object are more important than others with regards to the user explicitly influencing them or having to accept them. Whether the app code is generated as TypeScript or JavaScript is something the user should not be surprised with &lt;EM&gt;after&lt;/EM&gt; accepting the app! On the other hand, the author name, which is only written into package.json, can be reliably defaulted to the logged-in user name and also very easily changed later on if needed. Hence, the parameter descriptions explain not only &lt;EM&gt;what&lt;/EM&gt; they do, but also how much the user should be bothered with them. As result, Joule usually does not even mention half of the parameters, thus keeping the conversation focused.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AndreasKunz_0-1762953076854.png" style="width: 455px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339533i8B53DC0B3A50E913/image-dimensions/455x912/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="455" height="912" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_0-1762953076854.png" alt="AndreasKunz_0-1762953076854.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-849511975"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;How to stop the agent&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Regarding the state &lt;EM&gt;after&lt;/EM&gt; the app was accepted, the prompt explains "&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AFTER the user has generated the application, you **MUST NOT** continue discussing parameters for generation, but rather [...] i&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;n particular by referring the user to the '/ui5' command for most requests or '/ui5-create-page'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;for adding pages to the app, because they are much better than you in developing features, as they have the capability to automatically select a suitable context of files.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;".&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This means the transition in the overall process between refining parameters and "no more changes possible" is not a hardcoded step or denoted by changing the system prompt, but rather explained up-front. That's enough. Can you talk Joule into proposing another set of parameters after the app was accepted? Maybe. But its &lt;EM&gt;normal&lt;/EM&gt; behavior is just right: it will explain that the app can not be created again without restarting the conversation. Nevertheless, there are also non-AI guardrails in place to prevent the app from being generated again, thus causing trouble.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;All in all, we shape Joule’s behavior by explaining the templating tool and its limits, by stating the goal and desired behavior towards this goal, and by explaining the general flow, in particular the state after app acceptance. This is enough to guide it to a suitable reaction for whatever the user requests.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Even if the user insists like this:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="AndreasKunz_0-1762962593436.png" style="width: 457px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/339649i5AAFEF728BB75C51/image-dimensions/457x620/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="457" height="620" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_0-1762962593436.png" alt="AndreasKunz_0-1762962593436.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-652998470"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Context, context, context!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To make the entire feature really user-friendly, however, it is not sufficient to write a good prompt, but the context must also provide enough information to the LLM to allow for informed decisions. Hence, information like the list of project root files and folders, whether a Git repository is present, plus CAP service/entity/property info, and more, are gathered (e.g. using the &lt;A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap-ux/project-access" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;@sap-ux/project-access&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;package). This knowledge is provided as prompt context behind the scenes or used in another way (like as content of the suggested prompts). This makes Joule aware of the environment it acts in, leading to better responses, like automatically avoiding app names that would conflict with existing folder names.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Agentic coding assistants like Cline, GitHub Copilot, Cursor etc. usually have the ability to read files and execute shell commands as needed to understand their environment. In this pure user request + LLM response environment this might have been a bit harder to build. Basically, more tools could have been defined, e.g. by describing other JSON object structures for invoking them. But control would not so easily return to the LLM until after the user has entered another prompt. Or, there could have been one "preprocessor" LLM request asking for needed files, like it is done for the other&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT face="andale mono,times"&gt;/ui5*&lt;/FONT&gt;&amp;nbsp;commands.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;But for a narrow scenario like app creation this wasn't necessary. Collecting the most relevant information up front not only provides sufficient context, but also improves performance and reliability by avoiding repeated tool calls and unpredictable LLM loops.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-456484965"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In-response prompting&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The real-world context, however, changes over time. Specifically, once the app is created and accepted, there are new additional files present.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When developing the &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/give-your-ai-agent-some-tools-introducing-the-ui5-mcp-server/ba-p/14200825" target="_self"&gt;UI5 MCP server&lt;/A&gt;, we observed that the agentic AI tool (e.g. Cline) using the MCP server often decided to inspect the new app directory tree after creation, causing several LLM roundtrips which cost time and tokens. Or it would run "npm install" again, even though it had already been executed. Or it would make specific coding errors very often in subsequent modifications. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To avoid this, we extended the response of the MCP server after creating the app. Normally, it contains just the success message. &lt;A href="https://github.com/UI5/mcp-server/blob/a5a06382e0b3b8b39beaf1f40e95f2d887b3b50b/src/tools/create_ui5_app/createSuccessMessage.ts#L30-L66" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;But now it includes&lt;/A&gt; a full list of generated files, it states that "npm install" was already executed and it instructs how to prevent those coding errors. Basically, the MCP server response added further updated instructions to the conversation context. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Exactly the same principle was applied in this new Joule feature. While there is no autonomous agent loop in this case which would inspect the new files, the knowledge &lt;EM&gt;which&lt;/EM&gt; files were created can be valuable for the conversation with the user. And while the&lt;FONT face="andale mono,times"&gt;/ui5-create-app&lt;/FONT&gt; command doesn't modify any code after app creation (thus avoiding the coding issues), facts like whether "npm install" was already executed, or whether the created UI5 Table in the MainView is lacking any columns, are useful for giving the user hints how to continue. Therefore, the context is extended by adding a hidden message to the conversation history.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-259971460"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Traditional coding has its place(s)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;In addition to the process of context collection, deterministic coding is also used &lt;EM&gt;after&lt;/EM&gt; the app has been accepted by the user for making the app consumption as smooth as possible. When inside a CAP project, it for example ensures that the &lt;EM&gt;cds-plugin-ui5&lt;/EM&gt; is added as dependency. This allows the UI5 tooling, including TypeScript transpilation of the UI5 app when needed, to run as part of the "cds watch" or "npm start" script of the CAP project itself.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Also, this dependency and all the UI5 app dependencies need to be installed. Unfortunately, there is a wide range of options and specific setups which might be used for dependency management in the already existing app. Probably&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;npm&lt;/EM&gt;? With or without workspaces? &lt;EM&gt;yarn&lt;/EM&gt;? &lt;EM&gt;pnpm&lt;/EM&gt;? Others? The code detects what is used and tries to cover the 95% case. The initial setup might not be complete in &lt;EM&gt;every&lt;/EM&gt; scenario, but for most users it will “just work,” providing a good developer experience.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI is fine and all, but sometimes one has to go the extra mile and do some coding.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-63457955"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Use deterministic code where reasonable (because the space of possibilities is bounded and a deterministic and quick result is beneficial) .&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Use LLMs for language understanding or dealing with an unpredictable range of possible requests.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Don't try to "program" the LLM with an if/else prompt, but treat it like an intelligent human: state the goal, options and boundaries—and let it decide on its own.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Provide solid pre-collected context so the LLM can make good decisions reliably.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId--133055550"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;P.S.:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;For those who prefer graphics over text to gain an understanding of something, here is a depiction of the overall information flow inside this feature.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AndreasKunz_0-1763130462734.png" style="width: 931px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/340805i5BAE698E5DCD6369/image-dimensions/931x498/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="931" height="498" role="button" title="AndreasKunz_0-1763130462734.png" alt="AndreasKunz_0-1763130462734.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;If you know me, you know I love an analogy. It’s always helpful to make new information make sense by likening it to something we already understand.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In my role here at SAP, I talk about adoption a lot. It’s a point that I (and my wonderful team, Solution Value Advisory) really push with our customers, who sometimes think of adoption as a step in the overall process, something you &lt;EM&gt;do&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;after go-live.&amp;nbsp; So, my analogy for today is to look at adoption like a relationship, because it’s never just about the software, but about the people and how they interact with the system and each other.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s not much of a stretch, really. At the start, it’s a mix of excitement, a little confusion, and commitment that comes with bringing something new into your life, and hoping it thrives, grows, and has the support of people around you.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="4" color="#3366FF"&gt;The honeymoon stage&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;In my last role several years back, I worked on Ariba solution implementations. Being on a shared services team, I got to stick my hands into a lot of different customers’ Ariba deployments. It felt great, for the customer and for me, to reach what felt like a finish line: &lt;EM&gt;go-live&lt;/EM&gt;. That point of the new solution(s) going live after months of setup and testing. The vibes were always good - everyone was hopeful, users explored the system, performed tests. Teams got trained. There was that spark of possibility, that sense of &lt;EM&gt;this time, things will be different.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But just like any new relationship, the shine fades if the day-to-day connection isn’t nurtured. Old habits creep back in, shortcuts resurface. And, before long, that beautiful new tool starts gathering dust.&amp;nbsp; Remember, &lt;STRONG&gt;adoption doesn’t end at go-live, that’s when it begins.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="4" color="#3366FF"&gt;Relationships thrive on consistency, and so do systems&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Healthy adoption looks a lot like a healthy partnership: steady, intentional, and full of small moments that build trust.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It’s when someone logs in and sees that their preferences were remembered. It’s when data syncs across systems, so people stop fighting with spreadsheets and endless back-and-forth email. It’s when users realize the tool makes their jobs easier, not harder. It keeps the relationship alive.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But breakdowns don’t usually happen with a bang, but a fizzle. Users don’t revolt, they quietly disengage. They skip the process “just this once.” Then they stop trusting the data, because the process is getting skipped and they can’t find what they were looking for. And now something that was originally set up to create efficiency is now only causing frustration, and becomes a pain in the…well, you know. &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:"&gt;😊&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In my work with customers, I see this all the time.&amp;nbsp; I work a lot with customers on their supplier management processes especially, and I see a lot of this disengagement when it comes to onboarding. Tools like &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Cloud Identity Services&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Ariba Supplier Lifecycle &amp;amp; Performance (SLP)&lt;/STRONG&gt; can be super powerful, but they depend on trusted data and consistency. If people don’t understand why something matters, they won’t invest in making it work.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT size="4" color="#3366FF"&gt;The love language of AI is good data&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Now we’re entering a new chapter, one where AI tools like &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule&lt;/STRONG&gt; are ready to help make our jobs easier. But even Joule, which might seem like magic when you see it presented, needs a foundation of trust. This has been my main message of the year - reminding people that AI doesn’t make magic out of thin air, rather it builds on what we give it. If data is messy, disconnected, or if established processes are underused, Joule’s insights will be, too.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;(Pausing here for a shoutout to anyone who was at the Customer Success Day in NYC earlier this year where I did a whole session to essentially say, “Garbage in, garbage out”. The highlight, at least to me, was my AI-generated Ariba song parody of Naughty by Nature’s O.P.P.&amp;nbsp; &lt;EM&gt;Who’s down with SLP? Yeah you know me!&lt;/EM&gt;)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But back to my relationship analogy, think of it this way: if you never talk to your partner, you can’t expect them to finish your sentences. Joule works the same way. The relationship only deepens when we communicate through connected, clean, and well-adopted systems.&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT size="4" color="#3366FF"&gt;Adoption is ongoing care.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;As I said before, adoption isn’t a task. We don’t “complete” adoption. We maintain it. We check in with our users, we update them on changes, and we listen when something isn’t working and adjust before resentment sets in.&amp;nbsp; The most successful customers I see are those who treat adoption as a living process. Not just implementing technology, but inviting it into their company culture. When adoption is healthy, everything else (innovation, automation, AI, etc.) starts to flow naturally.&amp;nbsp; But just like any great relationship, it takes attention, empathy, and patience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I encourage you all to stay in tune with our &lt;A href="https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=42F2E964F4E71EDAA2D4E26DA01500E3&amp;amp;range=CURRENT-LAST" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;roadmap&lt;/A&gt;, as there’s a lot of exciting stuff to come in 2026 when it comes to AI in SAP. But as you read up on that and start to think how cool it will be and how much time it will save to have all of those new capabilities, remember that &lt;STRONG&gt;now&lt;/STRONG&gt; is the time to build the foundation for that new relationship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have any doubts about how well your company is adopting your solutions and how you’re doing on usage in comparison to other customers, do reach out to your CSM who can either help, or can pull in the right people to have that conversation. Sometimes that person is me, so say hi and maybe I'll share my library of Ariba song parodies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;A Story about Change Done Right&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Growing up, our dinner table conversations were a mix of stories about our day. My dad, a computer programmer for a large tech company, would talk about coding languages and mainframes, while my mom would share stories about her accounting role at a regional office for a global organization. Back then, I found myself leaning in whenever she talked about big changes happening at her office.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;What struck me, even as a kid, was a clear pattern: when changes were significant, her leadership team went above and beyond to make the office environment collaborative and supportive. They held town halls, brought in specialized trainers, and one memorable summer they even had an ice cream truck visit the office every Friday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;I realize now that her leadership team understood something fundamental, which is that successful change management isn’t just about rolling out new tools, it’s about considering the human impact. My mom happily worked for that organization for years and even recruited me to intern there. That’s the power of thoughtful change management.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-11-17 at 11.45.45 AM.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342018i2A82FB19DD9D1FD2/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-11-17 at 11.45.45 AM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-17 at 11.45.45 AM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;So how can you model what my mom experienced when implementing AI in SAP Ariba or SAP Fieldglass? Let's look at the playbook.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Clear Communications: Everyone Deserves to Know the “Why”&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first lesson from my mom's experience was transparency. Her leadership team didn't just announce changes, they explained the "why" behind their decisions and created multiple ways for employees to understand and engage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When you're implementing AI in procurement, develop a robust communication strategy that addresses where you're deploying it and the rationale behind those choices. Maybe you’re:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Rolling out the AI-assisted SAP Ariba Category Management solution because it saves your team multiple hours per week by automating category analysis, enabling them to become strategic advisors with better data and faster identification of new business opportunities.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Piloting intelligent resume analysis&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in SAP Fieldglass&amp;nbsp;because it highlights top talent for&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; hiring managers, giving them more time to focus on their core responsibilities while gaining a competitive advantage in talent acquisition.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Be upfront about your reasoning. Use multiple communication channels that feel natural to your organization. Town halls work well for big-picture strategy and allowing open questions. "Ask Me Anything" sessions give employees a safe space to voice concerns. But don't stop there - weave updates into established channels like company newsletters, team meetings, and other standardized communications your teams already utilize and trust.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Most importantly, identify and leverage internal champions early in your communication strategy. These trusted team members can help translate technical concepts into practical benefits and address concerns from their peers’ perspective. When your teams have questions, take the time to answer them thoughtfully.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; This isn't just courtesy; it's essential for adoption.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Special Training Programs: Don't Skip This Step&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Here’s where many organizations stumble. They want to skip comprehensive training and assume people will figure out AI-driven tools on their own. Don’t make this mistake.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;First, Get Your Data Foundation Right&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Before you can train effectively, you need clean data. AI works best when the underlying data is structured, reliable, and consistently maintained, but many procurement organizations struggle with data that’s scattered across systems. Supplier names often vary between purchase orders and contracts and spend categories don’t align across business units. This fragmentation creates obstacles to adoption.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;That’s why you need to start by explaining how AI works within your solutions. When a user sees an AI-generated recommendation in SAP Ariba or an AI-generated statement of work (SOW) description in SAP Fieldglass, they should understand which data inputs created that content and why it matters.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Then, Focus on User Training&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With Joule&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, show users how conversational AI accesses your organization’s information and best practices, demonstrating why instant access to critical data improves their decision-making capabilities&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Joule Buying.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342022i188727207BFB6358/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Joule Buying.png" alt="Joule Buying.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With SAP Ariba&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, help users understand how market and historical data analysis creates real-time category strategy, supplier insights, and RFP recommendations, enabling them to make confident decisions and respond faster to changing conditions&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Joule RFP .png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342023i4CA0420BEAFA6DCB/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Joule RFP .png" alt="Joule RFP .png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;With SAP Fieldglass&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, explain how basic project inputs generate comprehensive descriptions for both job descriptions and SOWs, so hiring managers can trust AI-enhanced deliverables while focusing on strategic workforce planning&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="FG.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342024i295AAC3233AC9B1E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="FG.png" alt="FG.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Finally, Nurture and Support your Champions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Your champions will help drive your success and should also be involved in validating AI recommendations during pilot phases. When they can vouch for the accuracy and usefulness of AI-generated insights, your solutions will be more impactful and their endorsement will carry a lot of weight, just like my mom’s feedback did at her organization. Keep your champions engaged by recognizing their contributions publicly, providing them with exclusive previews of new features, and regularly asking them for their input on product improvements. Personalized attention helps maintain their enthusiasm and advocacy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Your team won't automatically love new features just because they're AI-driven. You need to train them properly, communicate quick wins clearly, and continuously drive adoption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Ice Cream for Everyone: The Human Element Matters&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;That summer, my mom made it her mission to try every flavor from that ice cream truck. She’d come home excited to tell us about both the ice cream and the wins, big and small, that her team was racking up with their new processes. And the best part? The changes let her spend more time digging into the more interesting, complex invoices instead of processing the easy ones that were never flagged.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The small gestures mattered as much as the robust communication plans and training programs, creating an environment where change felt celebratory rather than threatening.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Don't underestimate the human element that comes with any significant change. While AI-enabled solutions like SAP Ariba and SAP Fieldglass ensure there's always a human in the loop, people still feel natural apprehension about adopting tools that are designed to drive efficiency. They wonder if their expertise will still be valued, if their jobs will change, or if they'll be able to master new ways of working.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Address this directly by highlighting how AI creates opportunities for greater visibility and strategic impact. For example:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Joule eliminates information bottlenecks&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; by making information conversationally accessible. It puts details like purchasing insights and hiring best practices at users’ fingertips.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Sourcing and Bid Analysis Agents&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt; in SAP Ariba solutions reduce decision-making stress and increase agility by analyzing market and historical data to create and adapt RFPs in real time. This gives users confidence in purchasing decisions and faster responses to supply chain disruptions while freeing them to focus on negotiations and relationship building.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The SAP Ariba Central Invoice Management solution elevates user roles by automating invoice processing where key thresholds are met. This reduces&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;manual data entry so teams can focus on high-value exception management and build stronger vendor relationships.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;AI-assisted SOW creation tools in SAP Fieldglass applications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;streamline project planning by generating comprehensive descriptions from basic project inputs, enabling hiring managers to create detailed SOWs faster. The tools also drive consistency across templates and projects, which helps users shift from &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;administrative workforce management to strategic talent optimization.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The key is showing employees that AI elevates their expertise rather than replacing it, much like how my mom's new systems and processes made her work more strategic and less manual.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Change Management Best Practices Actually Work&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Successful AI adoption follows the same change management approach that worked for my mom's organization years ago: clear communication, comprehensive training, genuine support, and celebration of progress. It’s a timeless template for transformation.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Communicate clearly and frequently about what's changing and why.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Invest in comprehensive training that's tailored for all skill levels.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Create opportunities for feedback and iteration.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Acknowledge that change is challenging and provide support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Most importantly, keep the human experience at the center of your implementation strategy. Technology should make people's work more interesting and valuable, not more complicated or uncertain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When procurement professionals can spend less time on data compilation and more time on strategic initiatives, have better insights to inform negotiations, and respond more quickly to business needs — that's when AI becomes fun and transformational.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Screenshot 2025-11-17 at 11.48.31 AM.png" style="width: 278px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/342019iF1943AFC0E20885B/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="Screenshot 2025-11-17 at 11.48.31 AM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-17 at 11.48.31 AM.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;By getting this right, you ensure that your teams won't just adopt AI, they'll become advocates for it. They’ll share success stories and help scale the transformation across your organization, and they'll talk about how much fun they’re having at the dinner table, just like my mom did.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Ready to optimize your company's approach to AI?

If other LOBs are configured with different IAS tenants then you may have to migrate them to this IAS tenant it will be really challenging. As highlighted in my earlier blog this requires proper planning for unification of all the SAP LOBs into a single IAS tenant.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We had details discussion with SAP Team about the critical aspect of GUID (SCIM ID) – All along I had an impression that GUID were required for user authentication and conversations and it requires to send this information from IAS to Ariba which was not required as Ariba doesn’t depend on it entirely rather it uses other attributes of the user like email ID and Login name even though Ariba uses S4HANA in the backend it is completely controlled from Application side.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;The question will arise what about S4HANA either cloud or on-premise systems to be integrated with Joule how the GUID will be taken care of. It entirely depends on the way the users from IAS to these LOBs are sync. Once we achieved it part of Task center implementation is that the GUID of uses from IAS were updated into S4HANA on premise (existing setup) using BADI. You can refer to any blog or online information you will find the details.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GAKJ_0-1763206243255.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341506i066580721C895564/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GAKJ_0-1763206243255.png" alt="GAKJ_0-1763206243255.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As per the blog we changed the url from ondemand.com to cloud.sap with the help of Ariba team since as customer you don’t have an option to change it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GAKJ_1-1763206243258.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341507iA9E093F67E14C1D3/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GAKJ_1-1763206243258.png" alt="GAKJ_1-1763206243258.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since already we had the existing setup of Ariba integration with IAS there are no source and target systems created in IDP.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Thankfully the blog has provided the json files for source system and target system which we used and manually created them for replication of users and groups from Ariba to IAS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the blog and in help document it is mentioned that once the above step is completed we should have the necessary bundled applications, Source, target systems in IAS which didn’t happen in our case since we already had the necessary application defined manually for integration of Ariba with IAS. I recommend this to be included in any of the blogs or in the help document so that customer is aware of it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Sourcing system&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GAKJ_2-1763206243268.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341508i071AA65CE3B30990/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GAKJ_2-1763206243268.png" alt="GAKJ_2-1763206243268.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Target system&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GAKJ_3-1763206243280.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341509i478EC1598C7D123A/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GAKJ_3-1763206243280.png" alt="GAKJ_3-1763206243280.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;OAuth Credentials for SCIM API (SAP Ariba Developer Portal)&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Follow the steps mentioned in the blog and the difference is we faced issue with replication of users and groups from Ariba to IAS and after session with Ariba team advised us to create SCIM API in place CDM API created using workzone CDM Content and these details are meant to use in source system of users and groups replication from IAS to Workzone. The details of SCIM API requested through SAP Ariba Development Portal. It is possible to get both API’s by creating the incident as we didn’t find the workzone CDM API in the portal and it is created and sent to us by Ariba team except creation of secret which can be done by the administrator of portal.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GAKJ_4-1763206243288.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341510i6A582AA5DF427F6F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GAKJ_4-1763206243288.png" alt="GAKJ_4-1763206243288.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;3.1 &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Create Ariba to IAS User Sync -

In Ariba the users and groups are replicated from Ariba-IAS-WZ. The explanation is that both products are different in the way they interact with BTP. SF is part of BTP whereas Ariba is completely different SAAS product.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GAKJ_26-1763206243462.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341532i013EBEA279222026/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GAKJ_26-1763206243462.png" alt="GAKJ_26-1763206243462.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule Test Scenarios&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Follow the use cases from the below link. Test each case end to end understand all the scenarios application like Informational, Transactional, Navigational.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Note that beyond the scenarios what are explained and configured to work in Joule don’t execute in you natural language as you won’t find a proper response.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Each interaction user make with joule and response received will be treated as one token and as I mentioned in my earlier blog “Ariba integration with SAP successfactor “you are entitled for fixed number messages free and after that you will be charged so understanding the scenarios and educating the business users adhering to it is critical as of now. Not sure if SAP increases the number of messages free.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/capabilities-guide/joule-in-sap-ariba-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/capabilities-guide/joule-in-sap-ariba-solutions&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GAKJ_27-1763206243474.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341534i4BF6340D70DA9A7F/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GAKJ_27-1763206243474.png" alt="GAKJ_27-1763206243474.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="GAKJ_28-1763206243483.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/341533iB039DE2722164434/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="GAKJ_28-1763206243483.png" alt="GAKJ_28-1763206243483.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Conclusion:&amp;nbsp;&lt;U&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Next Generation of Procurement&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The integration of &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule AI Copilot with SAP Ariba Sourcing&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a significant step toward an AI-driven, friction-less procurement process. This implementation journey, especially for customers with &lt;STRONG&gt;existing SSO configurations&lt;/STRONG&gt;, underscores that while official documentation is really useful but it requires changes for both scenarios mentioned.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1894533962"&gt;Key Takeaways and Future Focus&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;This experience highlights several vital points for organizations embarking on this integration:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;IAS Unification:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The seamless integration of Joule across multiple Line of Business (LOB) applications, like SuccessFactors and Ariba, hinges on the &lt;STRONG&gt;unification of all LOBs to a single SAP Cloud Identity Services (IAS) tenant&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This prevents complex migration challenges and ensures a cohesive user experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;User Sync:&lt;/STRONG&gt; For customers already integrated via SSO, the blog's requirement for a separate IAS-to-Ariba user sync can be potentially &lt;STRONG&gt;eliminated or simplified&lt;/STRONG&gt;, as Ariba primarily relies on existing attributes like email and login name for authentication, not the GUID/SCIM ID for conversation context, which is the main dependency for other applications like S4HANA, SuccessFactors and SAP concur.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Beyond the Standard API:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The need to request the &lt;STRONG&gt;SCIM API&lt;/STRONG&gt; in addition to the standard OAuth Credentials (CDM API) for user and group replication from Ariba to IAS is a practical detail that requires a proactive approach with the SAP Ariba development team.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Maturing Platform:&lt;/STRONG&gt; The initial issues faced with the &lt;STRONG&gt;Joule application identification&lt;/STRONG&gt; in IAS and the subsequent need for Ariba team intervention to activate &lt;STRONG&gt;feature toggles&lt;/STRONG&gt; demonstrate that the Joule integration architecture, while robust, is still actively maturing. Future releases are expected to streamline the automatic identification and bundling of applications within IAS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;In summary, this integration has successfully delivered the conversational and transactional capabilities of the Joule AI Copilot into the SAP Ariba Sourcing landscape. As SAP continues to invest in generative AI, understanding these practical implementation insights will be crucial for other enterprises to achieve a &lt;STRONG&gt;truly unified, intelligent, and highly efficient procurement experience&lt;/STRONG&gt; while maximizing the value of their existing SAP ecosystem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Business analysts today are expected to turn complex datasets into insight faster than ever; analyzing trends, spotting opportunities, and ultimately providing line-of-business leaders with the information necessary to make informed decisions. To meet these demands, they need tools that simplify analysis, ensure data quality, and accelerate their path from question to actionable insight.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;At&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/virtual.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;SAP TechEd 2025&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;, SAP announced a suite of advancements designed to do just that—continuing to drive momentum across its data and AI portfolio.

By embedding more intelligence directly into everyday workflows, these applications let analysts start with much of the foundational work already modeled, monitored, and enriched with AI—so they can focus on understanding trends, identifying gaps, and answering the “why” behind the data, rather than the mechanics of assembling it.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The Value of Intelligent Applications at a Glance:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Consistent, trusted data&lt;SPAN&gt; sources resulting in reliable, repeatable insights&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Less manual prep work&lt;SPAN&gt; and more time spent analyzing and interpreting&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Shorter analysis cycles&lt;SPAN&gt; through immediate access to prebuilt dashboards&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Higher trust and alignment through unified metrics and premodeled insights&amp;nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;Clearer explanations &lt;SPAN&gt;behind anomalies, trends, and performance drivers&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;AI-enhanced recommendations &lt;SPAN&gt;tailored to each line of business&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Intelligent Applications by Line of Business" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/345212iC18AA34F61DAA573/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Intelligent Applications for Line-of-Business.png" alt="Intelligent Applications by Line of Business" /&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-caption" onclick="event.preventDefault();"&gt;Intelligent Applications by Line of Business&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Key Updates and Expanded Use Cases&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Following up on the intelligent application announcement made at SAP Sapphire in 2025, SAP has expanded both previews&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT color="#000000"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;and general availability.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;AI agents are transforming enterprise operations—autonomously interpreting data, making decisions, and executing tasks; but as you scale your use of AI, a new challenge emerges: &lt;STRONG&gt;how do you truly understand what your agents are doing, why they act the way they do, and what their return on investment really is?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;That’s the value of the agent mining capabilities &lt;STRONG&gt;in SAP Signavio solutions &lt;/STRONG&gt;—to bring visibility, accountability, and continuous optimization to the growing ecosystem of AI-driven process transformation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1894802852"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Problem: Invisible Autonomy in Enterprise AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;As AI agents become more autonomous, their behavior may become more ambiguous. Their decisions happen in milliseconds, driven by complex reasoning or LLM-based inference that isn’t always visible to end users.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This creates critical business questions:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;What specific actions are my agents taking within my processes and how they are impacting them?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Are they acting in compliance to my rules and policies?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;How much does it cost to run them?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Are they actually delivering measurable business value?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Without transparency, organizations risk &lt;STRONG&gt;unpredictable outcomes&lt;/STRONG&gt;—agents that operate efficiently on paper but unpredictably in practice, potentially introducing errors, inefficiencies, or unnecessary costs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1698289347"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Discover agent mining in SAP Signavio&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="screenshot.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346076iD175808F47EB27CF/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="screenshot.png" alt="screenshot.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agent mining&lt;/STRONG&gt; enables organizations to understand and optimize the behavior of AI agents operating across their business processes. It provides the ability to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Trace agent behavior:&lt;/STRONG&gt; See how agents make decisions, navigate process steps, and adapt to different contexts.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Analyze impact:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Measure the agents’ influence on key metrics like process time, accuracy, and compliance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Monitor cost:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Track computational or LLM-related expenses to ensure cost-efficient performance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Benchmark performance:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Compare agent iterations to identify areas for refinement.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agent Mining is available natively for &lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Joule Agents&lt;/STRONG&gt;, but it can also extend to &lt;STRONG&gt;third-party or custom-built agents&lt;/STRONG&gt;, offering a unique and unified lens across your AI landscape.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1501775842"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Broader Vision: AI Agent Excellence&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="hoangvu_1-1764281584411.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346071i53AB0BB33DE0AA29/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="hoangvu_1-1764281584411.png" alt="hoangvu_1-1764281584411.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agent mining is one of four pillars of our comprehensive approach to AI agent excellence, ensuring that intelligent agents operate efficiently with the necessary process context while being safely adopted in full compliance and governance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agent discovery&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Identify the right processes and opportunities where AI agents can drive the greatest impact.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agent context&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Provide agents with the right process knowledge and compliance parameters to act responsibly and efficiently.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agent mining&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Observe and analyze how agents actually behave in operation—what decisions they take, how they perform, and how much they cost.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Agent value impact&lt;/STRONG&gt; – Quantify the business value that agents deliver, such as efficiency gains, cost savings, or improved customer experience.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;Together, these pillars ensure that organizations not only build AI agents for processes but continuously &lt;EM&gt;learn from&lt;/EM&gt; and &lt;EM&gt;improve&lt;/EM&gt; them to ensure compliance, governance and safe adoption into enterprise organizations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1305262337"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Real-World Example: The Accounts Receivable Agent&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Consider the SAP’s &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/spain/products/technology-platform/accounts-receivable-agent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Accounts Receivable (AR) Agent&lt;/A&gt;, which automates parts of the order-to-cash cycle. This agent matches payments to open invoices, interprets remittance advice, sends reminders for overdue accounts, and escalates exceptions for human review. The agent can help produce important benefits, for example, it helps reduce Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) by prioritizing the closure of open items and surfacing high-value follow-up actions. It analyzes behavioral patterns to anticipate risk, recommend next best actions, and support users with meaningful, context-aware insights.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By leveraging the agent mining capabilities in SAP Signavio, the AR team can analyze the agent behaviour and understand &lt;EM&gt;why&lt;/EM&gt; or &lt;EM&gt;how&lt;/EM&gt; those results are achieved, and more specifically:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Observe decision patterns:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Understand when the agent decides to match invoices automatically versus escalating them.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Identify cost drivers:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Detect cases where complex remittance language triggers costly LLM inference cycles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Evaluate process impact:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Quantify how agent-driven automation reduces days sales outstanding (DSO) or exception-handling time.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Optimize agent logic:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Spot recurring scenarios that lead to human overrides and refine the agent’s contextual knowledge accordingly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, if the mining data shows that certain customers’ remittance notes consistently confuse the agent, the team can retrain the model or adjust confidence thresholds—cutting costs and improving accuracy.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1108748832"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Next Chapter: From a Single Agent to a Multi-Agent System&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Building on the Accounts Receivable (AR) Agent example, we now take a step further—from understanding one agent’s behavior to analyzing an entire ecosystem of agents working together. In many real-world scenarios, business outcomes aren’t driven by a single autonomous agent but by a network of collaborating agents that coordinate to solve broader, cross-functional challenges.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Let’s now imagine a hypothetical scenario where the Accounts Receivable Agent operates alongside other agents such as one for order management, one for billing, and one supporting customer communication . Together in this example, they form a multi-agent system that manages the complete order-to-cash lifecycle—automatically resolving discrepancies, predicting late payments, and even initiating proactive customer outreach.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By applying multi-agent mining within SAP Signavio, process experts such as process owners, managers and analysts can uncover not just what individual agents do, but how they interact and collectively drive business performance. This enables them to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Discover collaboration dynamics:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Analyze how agents exchange information or trigger actions across processes to achieve shared goals.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Detect coordination gaps:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Identify where hand-offs between agents cause delays, redundancies, or missed insights.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Measure systemic impact:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Evaluate how agent collaboration influences high-level KPIs such as cash flow, customer satisfaction, or process cycle time.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Refine orchestration rules:&lt;/STRONG&gt; Optimize the logic that governs when and how agents should intervene or communicate for maximum efficiency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, if mining data reveals that the agent supporting billing often waits for the &amp;nbsp;agent for accounts receivable to complete validation before sending invoices—creating unnecessary latency—the orchestration can be adjusted to allow parallel execution with confidence thresholds. This evolution—from analyzing a single agent to optimizing a network of agents—demonstrates how agent mining at scale can transform isolated automation into an intelligent, collaborative digital workforce.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the following demonstration, we show how multi-agent mining in SAP Signavio reveals collaboration patterns between a series of fictious agents.. By analyzing their interactions, we uncover coordination gaps, optimize orchestration, and see how their combined behavior drives end-to-end business performance.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/source-Ids-list" target="1_fjcfz1mi" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-912235327"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why Agent Mining Matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agent mining is more than a monitoring capability— It provides a new level of visibility and measurable insights empowering organizations to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Increase transparency&lt;/STRONG&gt; into agent behavior and decision logic.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Control operational costs&lt;/STRONG&gt; by understanding and optimizing LLM usage.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ensure compliance&lt;/STRONG&gt; through auditable decision trails.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Continuously improve performance&lt;/STRONG&gt; by learning from live agent execution.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Measure true business value&lt;/STRONG&gt; of AI automation, not just efficiency metrics.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-715721822"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;From Discovery to Value&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P&gt;Agent mining is core to maximize the impact of AI agent deployments and attain AI agent excellence. From discovering where to deploy agents, to contextualizing their operations, to measuring their impact, mining provides the visibility needed for &lt;STRONG&gt;responsible, high-performance AI agent adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The result: AI agents that don’t just &lt;EM&gt;work&lt;/EM&gt;—they work &lt;EM&gt;transparently&lt;/EM&gt;, &lt;EM&gt;efficiently&lt;/EM&gt;, and &lt;EM&gt;strategically&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;With SAP Signavio capabilities for agent mining, organizations can finally see, understand, and optimize the invisible intelligence powering their digital processes.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you have any questions on agent mining, please feel free to reach out to me by commenting down below.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;The oil and gas domain has historically been one of the most stable but also conservative areas of enterprise architecture. Over multiple decades, SAP customers have evolved from custom ABAP solutions to standardized S/4HANA objects, Fiori applications, and integrated complex logistics planning and processes. While this has driven consistency and transactional efficiency, the &lt;STRONG&gt;core decision-making mechanisms in field logistics remained predominantly human-driven&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;with, manual validation, and the experience of field and personnel&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP Field Logistics is a solution built on SAP S/4HANA. It is available on both S/4HANA private cloud and public cloud.&amp;nbsp; This solution enables customers leverage best in class industry practices to manage the logistics movement of their own- and third-party items between their supply and demand plants.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;We are happy to announce that in &lt;STRONG&gt;May 2025&lt;/STRONG&gt;, we at SAP introduced a landmark innovation:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;the very first Joule-enabled capability across all industries, delivered specifically within SAP Upstream Field Logistics.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This early release is subtle in scope but monumental in strategic significance. It marks the beginning of Field Logistics evolution from traditional business processes to a future where core FL operations become deeply AI-driven through Joule.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A Strategic First Step: Joule’s Inventory Insights for FL&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The initial capability released in May focuses on a &lt;STRONG&gt;read-only non-stock inventory scenario&lt;/STRONG&gt;, allowing users to retrieve consolidated product and equipment visibility through natural language and gives the latest milestone of its lifecycle to help to know where the equipment is located. Even though this first use case is intentionally controlled, it is designed as the &lt;STRONG&gt;foundation for a multi-release future where Joule will perform full field logistics (FL) transactions end-to-end&lt;/STRONG&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP’s intention is clear:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Start small, prove value, ensure reliability, and then scale AI-driven operations across the entire upstream lifecycle.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This first release demonstrates Joule’s ability to:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Understand Field Logistics terminology in 50 different languages&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Interpret users queries through Natural Language Processing and provide contextual answers instantly&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Display list of products along with relevant information’s like plant, Purchase order, different quantities etc&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Navigate to Manage logistics application from Joule to get a wholistic view&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;While simple on the surface, the underlying architecture sets the stage for powerful, future-ready logistics automation.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What This Means for Customers&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Faster, simpler access to operational intelligence&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Users can ask Joule questions in natural language — no need to navigate complex screens or interpret multiple reports.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Immediate visibility where it matters most&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Inventory and material readiness have direct impact on non-productive time.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A future-proof foundation for autonomous logistics&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This first release is intentionally scoped — but designed for expansion into item receival, returns process, and more.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A clear step toward an “AI co-pilot” for upstream operations&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule is not just a search tool. It is the beginning of a more intelligent, proactive, and predictive logistics environment.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Technical Highlights Behind the Scenes&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;While the customer experience focuses on simplicity, the technical implementation is sophisticated:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SrinivasaMural_0-1764575303042.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346883i4874BCB8FAF73DFB/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SrinivasaMural_0-1764575303042.png" alt="SrinivasaMural_0-1764575303042.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Flow Diagram&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="SrinivasaMural_1-1764575303045.jpeg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/346882iFEFF45DEE8079013/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="SrinivasaMural_1-1764575303045.jpeg" alt="SrinivasaMural_1-1764575303045.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Semantic Understanding of FL and S/4HANA Operational Objects&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule interprets upstream-specific structures such as:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Field Logistics items&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;PO, GR, Open and Return quantity&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Latest Milestone&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Non-stock Inventory availability data&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This domain-awareness is what enables Joule to deliver precise, contextual answers.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;2. Natural Language → CDS Query Generation&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule automatically translates plain language into data retrieval operations using:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;CDS consumption views&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;FL OData APIs&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This eliminates the need for custom queries or separate analytical tool.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Functionality&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Do follow the below link to understand about Joule and how to access the same in a Private Cloud system.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-a-comprehensive-setup-guide/ba-p/13786453" target="_blank"&gt;https://community.sap.com/t5/enterprise-resource-planning-blog-posts-by-sap/joule-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-a-comprehensive-setup-guide/ba-p/13786453&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Once you login to your Fiori system as a Supply Chain Analyst persona and click on the Joule icon at the top, all the capabilities that are part of your user role will be available.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Hi AI and Joule enthusiasts,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;I’m sure you’ve been following the release updates and saw the H2 highlights on agentic AI for SuccessFactors.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Joule in SuccessFactors now supports its first agent for Performance and Goals - designed to help managers prepare for employee performance reviews.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For more details on the agent, please see:&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/performance-and-goals-agent.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Performance and Goals Agent&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;If you are looking for the implementation steps you are very welcome to read the rest of the blog because I like to share the steps to get the agent activated and how you can test / trigger the agent.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pre-Requisites for Agent Activation&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Licenses: AI Units&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;- Joule for SuccessFactors is activated&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Recommendation for PM/GM Agent Usage&lt;/STRONG&gt;:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;To maximize the effectiveness of the Performance and Goals Agent, we strongly recommend enabling one or more of the following modules:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Performance Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Goal Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Continuous Performance Management&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;. This allows the agent to access relevant data from direct reports and provide more valuable analyses and actionable insights.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Activation Steps:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;1. Activate the Agent in SuccessFactors: &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Login to your SuccessFactors System&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;go to Admin Center&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;AI Services Administration -&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;enable the&amp;nbsp;Performance &amp;amp; Goals Agent&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;The Agent is currently marked as Base AI because we run a promotion phase (planned until Mai 2026). Please check the license model starting in April/Mail.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;2. Assign Permissions to Manager:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Login to your SuccessFactors System&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;assign permissions to your relevant permission roles: User Permissions -&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;AI Access&amp;nbsp;-&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Performance &amp;amp; Goals Agent&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;The Agent is designed for Managers incl. access to employee details. Employees would not have access to the agents for there self.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;3.&amp;nbsp;Refresh CDM contents&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;login to your BTP Global Account&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;select the subaccount where Joule is implemented&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;login to the WorkZone Application assigned to the global account&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jenny_geipel_0-1764678919457.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347514iA309826E5374397D/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jenny_geipel_0-1764678919457.png" alt="jenny_geipel_0-1764678919457.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN class=""&gt;Run a content channel refresh&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jenny_geipel_2-1764679008961.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347518i09CFE99A2F41D589/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jenny_geipel_2-1764679008961.png" alt="jenny_geipel_2-1764679008961.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;after the successful refresh check the content manager -&amp;gt; a new Role should be added&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="jenny_geipel_3-1764679092114.png" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347523i78BC8051A2A39691/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="jenny_geipel_3-1764679092114.png" alt="jenny_geipel_3-1764679092114.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Required activation Steps are done. Now you can wait that your regular jobs (SF - Refresh synchtetic Group Data and IPS - User/Group Synch to WorkZone) runs. If you want to test immediately you can also trigger this 2 jobs.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;4.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;In April this year, I decided to voluntarily&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/so-this-is-it-i-m-verped/ba-p/14068989" target="_self"&gt;retire early from SAP&lt;/A&gt; after 6 years of a very interesting journey. Indeed, I've lived from the inside the infusion of powerful Artificial Intelligence capabilities in &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/c-khhcw49343/SAP+Build/pd-p/73555000100700001491" target="_self"&gt;SAP Build&lt;/A&gt;, for &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-build-sap-build-code-when-generative-ai-comes-to-help/ba-p/13584227" target="_self"&gt;application development&lt;/A&gt; and for &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/generative-ai-boosting-process-automation-come-see-our-the-results-at-sap/ba-p/13709057" target="_self"&gt;process automation&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Since then, I've spent 8 months observing the IT industry evolution, particularly around AI. And now, I have very mixed feelings:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":heavy_check_mark:"&gt;✔️&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;On one hand, I'm impressed how well SAP is positioned on the market and how SAP AI is powerful&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":question_mark:"&gt;❓&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;On the other hand, I'm more and more worried by the impact humanoid robots and AI, from SAP and all vendors, will have on so many jobs everywhere.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So I decided to share my views with you in this blog post.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1766433166"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP is amazingly well positioned with Business AI&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;A month ago I watched SAP &lt;A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9qHsLmPMk4" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;TechEd Keynote&lt;/A&gt; and also a few sessions, and I have to say that I'm impressed. By the way, in case you missed it, watch the replay of the keynote:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;div class="video-embed-center video-embed"&gt;&lt;iframe class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FX9qHsLmPMk4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX9qHsLmPMk4&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FX9qHsLmPMk4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube" width="400" height="225" scrolling="no" title="Keynote: How SAP is Supercharging Developers for What's Next | AI &amp;amp; Agents | SAP TechEd 2025" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I discovered AI &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/blog-it-forward-pierre-col/ba-p/13449598" target="_self"&gt;more than 40 years ago&lt;/A&gt;,&lt;/STRONG&gt; when I was studying to graduate in 1986 as an engineer in computing science, and 10 years ago I was working for &lt;A href="https://www.fluidtopics.com/antidot-company/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Antidot&lt;/A&gt;, a french startup involved in knowledge graphs, where I wrote this &lt;A href="https://bit.ly/LED-Antidot-2012" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;white paper on Business Knowledge Graphs&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;in 2014.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, from my humble point of view, &lt;STRONG&gt;putting together&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color="#00CCFF"&gt;SAP ERP&lt;/FONT&gt; +&amp;nbsp;&lt;FONT color="#00CCFF"&gt;SAP Business Data Cloud&lt;/FONT&gt; + &lt;FONT color="#00CCFF"&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp;Knowledge Graphs&lt;/FONT&gt; + &lt;FONT color="#00CCFF"&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp;Business AI with Joule&lt;/FONT&gt; creates a winning combo. It puts SAP in a unique position , better than any competitor, to bring the best of AI to the customers.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="SAP announcements at TechEd.jpeg" style="width: 800px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347605i3BDAD036538092B6/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="SAP announcements at TechEd.jpeg" alt="SAP announcements at TechEd.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And what has been presented and announced at SAP TechEd makes SAP even stronger:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-ABAP-1&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a new model allowing to handle ABAP language: trained on more than 250 million lines of ABAP code, 30 million lines of CDS code, and extensive technical documentation, it is purpose-built to&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;explain&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;generate&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-the-next-era-of-abap-development/ba-p/14260522" target="_self"&gt;modern ABAP code&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP-RPT-1 (&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Relational Pre-trained Transformer Model-1&lt;/EM&gt;) is a &lt;STRONG&gt;brand new &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/what-is-sap-rpt-1-a-table-specialized-model-explained-through-the-original/ba-p/14277618" target="_self"&gt;classification and regression model&lt;/A&gt;,&lt;/STRONG&gt; allowing to &lt;STRONG&gt;better handle &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-rpt-1-a-revolutionary-tabular-ml-model-and-owasp-ml-top-10-compliance/ba-p/14270750" target="_self"&gt;structured, tabular business data&lt;/A&gt;.&lt;/STRONG&gt; It is a paradigm shift in machine learning, introducing a revolutionary approach that eliminates the security-performance trade-off entirely. SAP-RPT-1 achieves state-of-the-art performance and&amp;nbsp;already outperforms regular text-based LLMs&amp;nbsp;through semantic understanding of tabular relationships.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Knowledge Graph in SAP HANA &lt;/STRONG&gt;Cloud&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;an RDF graph built from system catalog, capturing tables, columns, relationships, and annotations. It provides&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/sap-hana-cloud-becomes-agentic-introducing-discovery-agent-amp-data-agent/ba-p/14257394" target="_self"&gt;the semantic layer&lt;/A&gt; needed for exploration, AI grounding, and graph-based reasoning.&lt;/STRONG&gt; It&amp;nbsp;allows agents to reason about data, to understand entities relationships, and which attributes are relevant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P data-unlink="true"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;A2A and MCP protocols &lt;/STRONG&gt;foster Agentic AI&amp;nbsp;by allowing&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/building-an-agentic-ai-system-with-agent2agent-a2a-and-mcp-tools-on-sap-btp/ba-p/14093412" target="_self"&gt;autonomous agents collaboration&lt;/A&gt;:&lt;/STRONG&gt; SAP is providing&amp;nbsp;out-of-the-box Joule agents and alllowing customers to create custom agents with Agent Builder in Joule Studio. Beyond that, agentic protocols such as&amp;nbsp;A2A - &lt;EM&gt;Agent to Agent&lt;/EM&gt; - and MCP - &lt;EM&gt;Model Context Protocol&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;- with SAP Lean IX &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1749118636333001o3gW" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Agent Hub&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/agent-mining-in-sap-signavio-understand-agent-behavior/ba-p/14279314" target="_self"&gt;Agent Mining&lt;/A&gt; in SAP Signavio&amp;nbsp;allow to &lt;STRONG&gt;standardize, deploy and monitor AI agents collaboration.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;To dig deeper on these topics, follow the links I've put in the text above, watch the replay of the SAP TechEd sessions and also refer to&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP&amp;nbsp; &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/topics/innovation-guide/h2" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Innovation Guide&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Guide&amp;nbsp;"&lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/joule/serviceguide/what-is-joule?locale=en-US" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;What is Joule?&lt;/A&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569919661"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What impact will AI have on human employment?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;So, we all agree, SAP is doing very well with Business AI for empowering companies to do better and faster. And this is very good for SAP and its entire ecosystem.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;But when it comes to employees working in these companies, things could be different. Indeed, some news popping up in mainstream media are a bit worrying. For instance, according to &lt;A href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/25/why-ai-wont-take-your-job-partnership-agents-robots-mckinsey/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;McKinsey &amp;amp; Company&lt;/A&gt;&lt;A href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/25/why-ai-wont-take-your-job-partnership-agents-robots-mckinsey/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;,&lt;/A&gt; AI can already do almost 60% of all the work:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/25/why-ai-wont-take-your-job-partnership-agents-robots-mckinsey/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Fortune McKinsey AI.jpeg" style="width: 700px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347585i0A89D332BF7783EC/image-dimensions/700x639/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="700" height="639" role="button" title="Fortune McKinsey AI.jpeg" alt="Fortune McKinsey AI.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Their research “&lt;A href="https://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/our-research/agents-robots-and-us-skill-partnerships-in-the-age-of-ai" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Agents, robots, and us: Skill partnerships in the age of AI&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/A&gt;” says that the future of work will be basically shaped by partnerships among people, agents, and robots - all powered by AI. The research emphasizes that capturing AI’s massive potential economic value - about $2.9 trillion by 2023 in the US only! -&amp;nbsp;depends entirely on how organizations will reorganize.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="Pierre_Col_1-1764761106700.png" style="width: 999px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347986i1CF8ED90C196E1FB/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="Pierre_Col_1-1764761106700.png" alt="Pierre_Col_1-1764761106700.png" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Indeed, be it for business users, for consultants, for developers, AI agents will be everywhere... and they will do a lot of tasks done by human employees today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And we have already seen this year how big tech firms have "reorganized" to embrace AI benefits:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Amazon -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/amazon-targets-many-30000-corporate-job-cuts-sources-say-2025-10-27/" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;30,000 layoffs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accenture -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/company-just-laid-off-11-123000530.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;11,000 layoffs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Microsoft -&amp;nbsp;&lt;A href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;6,000 layoffs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;HP - &lt;A href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/25/tech/hp-layoffs-ai-efforts" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;4,000-6000 layoffs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;So in total more than 50,000 jobs have been erased in a few months only. And SAP as well is shrinking its workforce: “I&lt;EM&gt;n one year, it could be one or sometimes two percent of jobs that are eliminated&lt;/EM&gt;” said Christian Klein, and&amp;nbsp;Dominik Asam&amp;nbsp; added “&lt;EM&gt;There are certain tasks which are automated and for the same volume of output we can afford to have less people&lt;/EM&gt;". He&amp;nbsp;admits to be "brutal",&amp;nbsp; comparing this program to routines such as brushing teeth...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile, it seems everyone is trying to reassure the public that everything will be fine… perhaps to prevent tens of millions of workers from becoming upset about the prospect of losing their jobs?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Should not a part of the value created by all the AI software and humanoid robots be used to compentiate this massive loss of jobs?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, in many countries, health insurance, unemployment insurance, and pensions are financed by contributions paid by employers and employees on human work. If the number of employees is decreasing, shouldn't social security contributions be levied on the work performed by AI agents and humanoid robots?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-center" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-center" image-alt="workers of the world unite.jpg" style="width: 480px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/347612i5102A5D408955909/image-dimensions/480x480/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2" width="480" height="480" role="button" title="workers of the world unite.jpg" alt="workers of the world unite.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Will robots embrace &lt;A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers_of_the_world,_unite!" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"&gt;Karl Marx slogan&lt;/A&gt;? &lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":upside_down_face:"&gt;🙃&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What do you think? How do you envision the impact AI and robots will have on your job in 3, 5 or 10 years?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Your feedback will be highly appreciated, so feel free to share your own views in the comments!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;</content>

The issue was poor prompt design. With proper prompt engineering, the assistant could have recognized my rebate request and guided me to the correct, enabled form. A smarter workflow would have turned a dead end into a faster way to get my rebate money.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;What fun!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;This experience underscores a critical truth:&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;EM&gt;when prompts fail to capture real&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;‑&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;world users’ intent, the customer experience collapses.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For business and IT users working with AI, this isn’t just a consumer inconvenience, it’s a wake‑up call. Prompt engineering is more than a technical capability; it’s the discipline of shaping interactions so that AI systems understand nuance, adapt to context, and deliver meaningful results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Whether in customer service troubleshooting, enterprise workflows (agentic AI), or customer engagement, the quality of prompts directly determines the quality of the user experience.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this age of AI agents and assistants, refining prompts is no longer optional; it is essential for building trust, driving efficiency, enabling scalable automation, and achieving successful outcomes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1569951496"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Reducing AI Project Failures - Understanding Prompt Engineering&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing inputs that guide AI models to produce desired outputs. By framing instructions accurately, organizations can harness AI to generate relevant, high-quality responses.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to a RAND report, 80% of AI project failures stem from poor human to AI communication. Misunderstandings between business and IT teams about goals, data, and capabilities are the most common cause of failure. Companies that master prompt engineering achieve significantly higher ROI compared to those relying on basic or ad hoc prompting (1).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;In short:&lt;/STRONG&gt; success doesn’t come from the technology alone; it comes from how we communicate with it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="People.at.Conference.jpg" style="width: 402px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/348237iE8CAF4B250712171/image-size/large/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=999" role="button" title="People.at.Conference.jpg" alt="People.at.Conference.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373437991"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prompt engineering is no longer a fringe capability and skill. It is becoming a critical organizational capability embedded into everyday business functions.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to Market Research Future (MRFR), the prompt engineering market was valued at $2.195 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow to $32.78 billion by 2035, with a staggering 27.86% CAGR (2).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1176924486"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Prompt Engineering Adoption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prompt engineering transforms vague queries into precise instructions, guiding AI toward accurate, consistent, and actionable outputs. With AI agents and assistants like SAP’s Joule, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, organizations recognize that prompt engineering is essential to maximize AI’s potential and align outcomes with business goals.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;SAP has embedded prompt engineering into Joule, powered by the Generative AI Hub in &lt;A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/what-is-sap-ai-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;SAP AI Core&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/codejam-ai-prompt-engineering-and-orchestration/blob/main/exercises/00-prompt-engineering-with-ai-launchpad/readme.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Launchpad&lt;/A&gt; (part of the SAP Business Technology Platform) and supported by SAP’s &lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-foundation-os.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;AI Foundation&lt;/A&gt;, delivering enterprise‑grade accuracy and trust with Large Language Models (LLMs).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;At SAP Sapphire 2025, SAP announced a proprietary &lt;A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/ai-core-genaihub-prompt-optimization..html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Prompt Optimizer&lt;/A&gt; built with the company, Not Diamond. This optimizer enables enterprises to migrate and adapt prompts across multiple LLMs, supporting consistency, accelerating adoption, and improving the user experience across diverse AI systems (3).&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Not Diamond envisions “a multi‑model AI future, with thousands of foundation models, millions of fine‑tuned variants, and billions &lt;SPAN&gt;of custom inference engines running on top of them&lt;/SPAN&gt;.” Their infrastructure routes, governs, and scales prompts across these systems, ensuring flexibility and trust.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This partnership confirms prompt engineering as an important, core enterprise requirement, bridging business strategy with technology capabilities for responsible AI.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-980410981"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Best of Prompt Engineering Capabilities&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prompt engineering serves as the strategic layer that transforms raw AI capabilities into business value, delivering a range of benefits including:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Clarifies Intent – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Ensures AI understands user goals, reducing miscommunication and aligning outputs with business needs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Customer Engagement &amp;amp; Personalization – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Crafts prompts that drive tailored chatbot interactions, outreach, and recommendations, fostering loyalty and satisfaction.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Structures Outputs – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Guides AI to deliver usable formats (tables, lists, reports, narratives) for clarity and consistency.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Improves Efficiency &amp;amp; Operational Automation –&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Minimizes unnecessary token usage, accelerates turnaround, and empowers agentic AI to automate repetitive workflows such as reporting, summarization, and FAQ handling.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Adds Domain Context – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Embeds industry‑specific language, governance and compliance rules, approved product names, synonyms, and brand tone for relevance.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Supports Scalability Across Teams – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Builds reusable prompt libraries and frameworks that allow consistent enterprise‑wide adoption without reinventing workflows.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Content Quality &amp;amp; Consistency – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Ensures outputs are brand‑aligned, accurate, and emotionally resonant across all channels.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Optimizes Across Models – &lt;/STRONG&gt;With tools like Not Diamond’s Prompt Optimizer, prompts can be migrated and adapted across Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, Joule, and other LLMs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Enhanced Accuracy &amp;amp; Decision‑Making – &lt;/STRONG&gt;Produces precise, consistent outputs and extracts actionable intelligence quickly to support better business decisions.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P&gt;By uniting these capabilities, prompt engineering becomes the foundation for trustworthy, scalable, and business‑aligned AI success.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="AdobeStock_558703749_Young.Professionals.jpeg" style="width: 400px;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/348242i10BE48643376C73E/image-size/medium/is-moderation-mode/true?v=v2&amp;amp;px=400" role="button" title="AdobeStock_558703749_Young.Professionals.jpeg" alt="AdobeStock_558703749_Young.Professionals.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-783897476"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Short on Time? Who Manages Prompt Engineering&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prompt engineering isn’t just the domain of IT or developers; business roles like product managers, business analysts, marketing, communications, operations, UX/CX designers, content strategists, and other lines of business are equally critical.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For example, product managers align prompts with business goals, analysts map workflows, designers ensure intuitive user experiences, and strategists refine language and tone. Together, they make AI outputs reliable and customer‑centric.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Also, a dedicated, focused part‑time prompt engineering consultant can help jumpstart this process by auditing the current status, delivering best practices, and establishing governance standards in collaboration with IT and key stakeholders.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In a fast paced, short-handed, busy work environment, these prompt optimization specialists can provide support by providing focus and discipline, coaching key stakeholders with standard operation procedures (SOPs), monitoring performance, and refining prompts as business needs evolve to help ensure AI systems remain accurate, consistent, and trusted across the enterprise.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-587383971"&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Prompt engineering is no longer a niche skill or technical curiosity; it has become a core business capability that drives efficiency, compliance, and innovation. Organizations that embrace it gain a competitive edge, while those that neglect it risk wasted investments and inconsistent results.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;By embedding prompt engineering as a business standard, integrated into workflows through enterprise‑wide libraries, governance, and automated refinement, companies can optimize AI strategies to keep pace with evolving models, regulations, and customer expectations.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The future of enterprise AI will not be defined by those who merely explore prompts, but by those who master them, transforming raw model potential into trusted, scalable business value.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;And as a result, users can save time by getting answers versus &lt;U&gt;gaps and dead ends&lt;/U&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-390870466"&gt;---&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;Your Comments are Appreciated!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":right_arrow:"&gt;➡️&lt;/span&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FFFFFF"&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;Interested to hear your experiences when prompting works and doesn't work from a business and IT perspective!!!&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;If you are new to prompt engineering, what are your impressions as a result of reading this blog?&lt;BR /&gt;Please take a moment to post them below...&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;Thanks!!!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-194356961"&gt;---&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;FONT color="#FF9900"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;About the Author&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rich Blumberg is a long time SAP Community member and contributor.

    <content>&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;This blog was authored by Joule Studio Product Managers: Charan Ravikumar and Maria Kondratyeva&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1637353611"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;H1 id="toc-hId-1440840106"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Setting Up Joule Studio for All Partner Flows and Entitlement Levels&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/joule-studio.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Joule Studio,&lt;/A&gt;&amp;nbsp;the latest capability in SAP Build, enables developers to build Joule skills and Joule agents tailored to unique business needs. These capabilities extend Joule copilot, orchestrate cross-functional workflows, and enhance enterprise efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;However, we recognize that the partner landscape, with its mix of TDD, PAYG, and subscription accounts, introduces unique complexities. Many of you have asked the essential question: "How do we, as partners, get Joule Studio set up correctly in our environments?"&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This guide is built specifically for you. It synthesizes insights from our support channels and direct partner feedback to address your most common challenges, such as multi-global account integrations and navigating the new SAP Build licensing in TDD environments. Whether you're starting fresh or integrating existing services, this post outlines everything you need to know to get started efficiently and cost-effectively.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Let's get started!&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-1373409320"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Critical Prerequisites: Licensing &amp;amp; Plans&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;Before diving into the setup flows, let's clarify three critical concepts that are often sources of confusion for partners. Getting these right from the start will save you significant time and effort.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1305978534"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The "New" SAP Build Plan (&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;build-default&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-align-justify lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="text-align : justify; padding-left : 30px;"&gt;Many partners have existing SAP Build entitlements on a legacy "standard" plan. To use Joule Studio, you must use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;build-default&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;plan, specifically for&amp;nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Critical Action:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Do NOT order a new, separate SAP Build subscription!&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;In your existing Partner TDD Global Account (under a PAYG model), the entitlement for the new plan is already available.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;You simply need to navigate to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Service Marketplace&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;in your BTP cockpit and activate the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;SAP Build Process Automation&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;service, ensuring you select the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;build-default&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;plan during setup.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Note:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ordering a new subscription instead of activating the existing entitlement often leads to selecting the wrong plan and creates unnecessary account complexity.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;TDD Licensing Options:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;License the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Pay-As-You-Go for SAP BTP for cloud test, demo, and development (SKU 8009282)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This grants you access to free "Fair Use Limits" for SAP Build &lt;STRONG&gt;(Recommended)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Alternative (Subscription):&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;A subscription-based&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;SAP Build TDD developer license (SKU 8019951)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;is also available, but it&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;does not&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;include the Fair Use Limits.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;What is Fair Use Limits (FUL): &lt;/STRONG&gt;The Fair Use Limit where the partner is provided an entitled specified threshold amount of TDD services free of charge per billing cycle. It’s designed to support development without unexpected costs.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL class="lia-list-style-type-square"&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Please refer to this link for more details on FUL -&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;A href="https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/assets/products/tech_plat/dgl/30/23/SAP1223023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/assets/products/tech_plat/dgl/30/23/SAP1223023.html&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-1109465029"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; Joule Entitlement&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;TDD Joule Base SKU: &lt;STRONG&gt;8020592&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Joule for Consultant and Joule for Developers are different licenses and not connected with Joule Studio license and its activation.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Cost for Custom Skills:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;There is&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;no additional cost or AI Unit consumption&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the orchestration and invocation of custom Joule skills built with Joule Studio's current features.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;However, the underlying services your skill uses (e.g., SAP Build Process Automation) will still follow their standard commercial models (e.g., consumption against your Fair Use Limits).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H3 id="toc-hId-912951524"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Multi-Global Account Scenario&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/H3&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;It is very common for partners to have their Joule entitlement in a TDD subscription based global account and their SAP Build entitlement in a separate TDD PAYG global account.&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;This is a supported scenario.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Golden Thread:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;The key to making this work is to ensure that&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;both global accounts are federated under the same SAP Cloud Identity Services (IAS)&lt;/STRONG&gt;. This single identity provider is what allows the two systems to trust each other and integrate seamlessly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;To run Joule Booster or Joule Formation (see table below), select the 2 global accounts you have.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;H2 id="toc-hId-587355300"&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Understanding Your Integration Flow: Starting Points and Required Steps&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;P&gt;This table outlines the five primary scenarios for integrating SAP Build Process Automation (SBPA&amp;nbsp;in the future text) capabilities into the Joule Studio environment.&amp;nbsp; Identify which flow best matches your current setup, whether you’re starting fresh or have existing SBPA or Joule subscriptions. This will immediately provide you with the exact action steps and critical notes required for a successful connection.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;TABLE width="957px"&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="295.217px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Starting Point&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="661.224px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;Key Action Steps&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD width="295.217px" height="392px"&gt;&lt;P&gt;The partner is setting up both&amp;nbsp;Joule&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;SBPA&amp;nbsp;from scratch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD width="661.224px" height="392px"&gt;&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Check the Prerequisites mentioned above.

How do I get it?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Do not order a new paid subscription. Ensure you have the correct TDD account with BTP PAYG license. Then, go to your BTP Cockpit -&amp;gt; Service Marketplace. Find "SAP Build Process Automation" and create a new instance/subscription, making sure to select the&amp;nbsp;build-default&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q2: My Joule and SAP Build are in different Global Accounts. Is that a problem?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;No, this is a common and supported partner scenario. The absolute requirement is that both global accounts' subaccounts use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;same Cloud Identity Service (IAS) tenant&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;for authentication.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q3: I ran the booster, but Joule Studio doesn't appear, or I get an error when deploying. What's wrong?&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is almost always one of three issues:&lt;/P&gt;&lt;OL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Mismatched Identity Services:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Your Joule and SBPA subaccounts are pointing to different IAS tenants.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Incorrect SBPA Plan:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;You are still on the "standard" plan instead of "build-default".&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Incorrect Joule SKU:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Make sure you have a correct Joule license under&amp;nbsp;&lt;STRONG&gt;Joule service TDD SKU (8018168)&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;at no cost. To be on the safe side, please contact with your account manager, making sure you have right SKU enabled.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Missing Role Collections:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;Your user is missing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;joule_extensibility&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;end_user&lt;/EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;roles in the Joule subaccount, or the necessary developer roles in the SBPA subaccount.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;P class="lia-indent-padding-left-30px" style="padding-left : 30px;"&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Q4: I followed the steps, but deployment still fails with an IdP error:&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;This points to a deeper trust configuration issue. Verify the trust settings between your BTP subaccounts and the IAS tenant. Ensure the&amp;nbsp;Integration with Joule&amp;nbsp;Formation status is&amp;nbsp;Ready.
