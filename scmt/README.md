# SAP Community Feeds

Below you can find some of the RSS feeds that I'm currently generating from the new SAP Community platform.

## SAP Community Topics

The current platform doesn't allow getting an RSS feed for an SAP Managed Tags, aka Topic. Not all topics available in SAP Community are included here. You'll be able to see the full list here - [topics](./topics/README.md).

## SAP Community Members

The current platform doesn't allow getting an RSS feed for a user. It will be quite an expensive task to generate a feed for every single member of the community, therefore I'm only including feeds for the [Developer Advocates team](https://developers.sap.com/developer-advocates.html) and a couple of examples from SAP Mentors and SAP Champions.

You'll be able to see the full list here - [members](./members/README.md).
